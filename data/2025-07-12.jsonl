Despite\nthese distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space\nthat correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot\nautonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit\nspatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied\ncognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated\nnavigation strategies in artificial life."}

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible\nframework often utilised in writing robot software, providing tools and\nlibraries for building complex robotic systems. However, ROS's distributed\narchitecture and technical messaging system create barriers for understanding\nrobot status and diagnosing errors. This gap can lead to extended maintenance\ndowntimes, as users with limited ROS knowledge may struggle to quickly diagnose\nand resolve system issues. Moreover, this deficit in expertise often delays\nproactive maintenance and troubleshooting, further increasing the frequency and\nduration of system interruptions. ROS Help Desk provides intuitive error\nexplanations and debugging support, dynamically customized to users of varying\nexpertise levels. It features user-centric debugging tools that simplify error\ndiagnosis, implements proactive error detection capabilities to reduce\ndowntime, and integrates multimodal data processing for comprehensive system\nstate understanding across multi-sensor data (e.g., lidar, RGB). Testing\nqualitatively and quantitatively with artificially induced errors demonstrates\nthe system's ability to proactively and accurately diagnose problems,\nultimately reducing maintenance time and fostering more effective human-robot\ncollaboration."}

While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by\ncomparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from\nopen-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -\nis more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and\nthe influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is\nfrequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments\nof intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing\nbiases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach\nleveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.\nApplied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,\nlimitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings\nsuggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the\ntransparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall\nvalidation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work\nadopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for\nrefinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the\npotential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for\nmore reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks."}

However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile\nskins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions,\nsuch as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body\ntouch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not\nrequire the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot\nequipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to\ndemocratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers\nto provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our\napproach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On\nFranka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can\nlocalize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU\nwithout adding any additional sensors to the robot.

Chang"], "title": "LangNavBench: Evaluation of Natural Language Understanding in Semantic Navigation", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in\nlanguage-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target\nobject described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a\nclear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the\nwords in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set\ndataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects\ndescribed at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine\nattributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was\nmanually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and\nsemantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a\nbenchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand\nand act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench\nallows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,\nspatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first\nthorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also\npresent Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable\nmulti-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small\nobjects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset."}
