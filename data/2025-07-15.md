### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VIL方法，通过对比学习和师生框架增强导航策略对视角变化的鲁棒性，在V2-VLNCE任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有导航策略对视角变化敏感的问题，提出广义场景V2-VLNCE。

Method: 采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并引入师生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE任务中，成功率提升8-15%，在RxR-CE数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，既能提升视角变化的鲁棒性，又不影响标准视角性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用面部生物特征异常模式检测深度伪造视频的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术容易被用于欺诈、诈骗和政治虚假信息，需要有效的检测手段。

Method: 基于面部生物特征的异常模式，开发了一种机器学习技术。

Result: 在大规模数据集上评估了该技术的有效性，并测试了其对视频处理和未知生成器的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测深度伪造视频，具有较高的可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据和任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型中的隐含偏差，通过两阶段方法生成场景描述并学习去偏投影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生偏斜预测，PRISM旨在无需预定义偏差类别或额外数据的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分为两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）通过对比式去偏损失学习投影，最小化虚假相关性并保持图像与文本嵌入的对齐。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种高效的去偏解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空和运动学信息的HMR-ViT方法，通过构建时空运动特征图像并使用Vision Transformer，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，缺乏同时利用两者的方法，限制了性能提升。

Method: 通过图像编码器提取视频帧特征，构建时空运动特征图像，并使用CRM优化特征排列，再通过Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了HMR任务的性能。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合NeRF和MPM的新框架，通过视觉观测推断颗粒材料特性，摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无法直接测量的情况下，通过视觉观测表征颗粒材料特性的问题。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟初始化材料点位置，通过贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际场景中颗粒材料的表征提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，通过多阶段数据验证策略提升多模态模型生成标签的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注数据量而非质量，缺乏对多模态基础模型生成标签质量的全面评估。

Method: VISTA结合多阶段数据验证策略和人工专家知识，识别和修正标签中的隐藏问题。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割任务中，VISTA通过定量和定性分析证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA显著提升了多模态模型生成标签的质量，为数据验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，用于提升长尾分布数据中尾部类别的图像生成多样性，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾分布数据中尾部类别的图像数量有限，导致生成模型在尾部类别上出现模式崩溃和多样性降低的问题。

Method: 引入两种对比损失函数：无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比条件生成和无条件生成来增强尾部类别的多样性。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT、PlacesLT等）上，该方法优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，成功提升了长尾分布数据中尾部类别的图像生成多样性。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了无限视频理解（Infinite Video Understanding）作为多媒体研究的下一个前沿目标，旨在解决长时间视频处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态扩展在视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但处理超长视频时仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性等挑战。

Method: 通过分析现有技术（如Video-XL-2、HoPE等）的局限性，提出需要创新的流式架构、持久内存机制和事件中心推理等方法。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了实现无限视频理解的核心挑战和研究方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是一个雄心勃勃的目标，将为多媒体和AI研究提供重要方向，推动相关技术创新。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight是一种无需训练的方法，通过利用注意力稀疏性优化视觉语言模型（VLM）推理，减少计算量并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度和注意力计算的复杂度，导致推理时间延长。通过分析注意力模式的稀疏性，可以优化计算效率。

Method: 提出BlindSight方法，利用输入模板感知的注意力稀疏掩码，根据注意力头的稀疏性分类，减少冗余计算。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上，BlindSight平均减少32%-41%的FLOPs，准确性变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight通过稀疏性优化显著提升了VLM的推理效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 展望了下一代基础模型的发展方向，强调统一建模能力、跨域泛化性和物理可解释性。

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需微调的方法，通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型来提取光流，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型（仅用于未来帧预测）来提取光流，避免因标签稀缺和合成数据与真实数据差距带来的微调困难。

Method: 基于Counterfactual World Model范式，通过注入微小扰动并跟踪其传播来提取光流，提出KL-tracing方法。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上分别实现了16.6%和4.7%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过提示可控生成视频模型是一种可扩展且高效的光流提取方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

Motivation: 研究卷积神经网络内部机制及其推理原因，特别是在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用。

Result: MI CAM在定性和定量指标上优于部分现有方法，与最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: MI CAM能提供无偏见的模型推理解释，适用于关键领域，表现优异。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo利用放射科医生的眼动视频序列提升LVLMs在胸片分析和报告生成中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的时序信息，而RadEyeVideo通过整合时空动态的眼动数据，提升模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频序列输入，评估其在报告生成和疾病诊断任务中的效果。

Result: 模型性能提升显著，报告生成任务提升24.6%，两项任务平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学LVLMs。

Conclusion: RadEyeVideo展示了专家知识与通用领域模型结合在临床任务中的潜力，推动了医疗图像分析的人本化方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

TL;DR: PointSD利用Stable Diffusion（SD）模型增强3D点云的自监督学习，通过点云引导图像去噪并提取SD特征，提升3D表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型受限于数据集规模，而SD模型在大规模数据上训练，可能弥补这一不足。

Method: 提出PointSD框架，将SD模型的文本编码器替换为3D编码器，训练点云到图像的扩散模型，并提取SD特征对齐3D主干网络。

Result: 实验表明，SD模型能有效提升点云自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: PointSD通过结合SD模型，显著改善了3D点云的自监督学习效果。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），通过多尺度姿态表示和置信感知因果注意力机制提升生成质量和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归方法在推理阶段的误差累积问题，以及扩散模型在实时任务中的局限性。

Method: 结合自回归和扩散模型，设计多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了方法的生成质量和实时效率。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Motivation: 解决HOI检测模型在真实世界中因环境变化、遮挡和噪声导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 基于HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集构建包含20种干扰类型的基准RoHOI，并提出语义感知掩码渐进学习策略（SAMPL）。

Result: SAMPL策略显著提升了模型在干扰条件下的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoHOI基准和SAMPL策略为HOI检测的鲁棒性研究提供了新标准。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

TL;DR: MG-CLIP通过保留和补偿模态间隙提升CLIP在持续学习中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作忽视了CLIP中的模态间隙，而这是其泛化和适应性的关键因素。

Method: 分析模态间隙变化，提出MG-CLIP方法，利用模态间隙保留和补偿。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙为持续学习提供了新视角，MG-CLIP简单有效。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法受限于短或通用文本提示，缺乏细粒度控制和泛化能力。SnapMoGen旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SnapMoGen数据集和MoMask++模型，后者通过多尺度标记序列和生成掩码变换器改进运动生成。

Result: MoMask++在HumanML3D和SnapMoGen基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并能处理用户输入。

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++显著提升了文本到运动生成的细粒度控制和泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于非线性MLP视觉语言连接器的新型姿态估计框架，显著提升了定位精度，同时保持了零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；而现有语言引导方法（如LocLLM）的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂的空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM采用两层的非线性MLP（带GELU激活）作为视觉语言连接器，实现跨模态特征分层融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，超越LocLLM 0.4 AP，并在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下显著提升了定位精度，推动了语言引导姿态估计的进展。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

*Zhimin Liao,Ping Wei,Ruijie Zhang,Shuaijia Chen,Haoxuan Wang,Ziyang Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的4D占用预测框架$I^{2}$-World，通过解耦场景标记化实现动态表达和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂3D场景标记化的挑战，以提升自动驾驶系统中场景演化的预测能力。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合编码器-解码器架构，实现高效4D占用预测。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别领先现有方法25.1%和36.9%，计算效率高（2.9 GB内存，37.0 FPS）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在4D占用预测中表现出色，兼具高效性和动态表达能力。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度方面存在不足，主要依赖复杂的辅助结构，导致优化信号冲突和局部编辑受限。

Method: SSD通过固定一个分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入常数项null-text分支稳定优化过程。此外，还加入了提示增强分支以提升编辑强度。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得了最先进的结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种高效且鲁棒的文本引导编辑解决方案，能够保持原始内容结构并实现平滑的提示特定修改。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Motivation: FSCIL在数据稀缺和增量学习的双重挑战下表现不佳，提示池方法在传统增量学习中有效，但在FSCIL中效果未知。

Method: 提出LGSP-Prompt，将提示学习从token维度转移到空间维度，结合局部空间特征和全局频域表示生成空间提示。

Result: LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示解决了token维度饱和问题，有效提升了FSCIL的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Result: MCA-LLaVA在多个幻觉和通用基准测试中表现出色，有效缓解了图像对齐偏差。

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过改进位置编码方法，显著提升了多模态对齐效果，减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解能力。

Conclusion: THYME方法有效解决了动态场景图生成的挑战，适用于地面和空中场景。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了新方法，解决了开放场景中的零样本检测问题。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线长时点跟踪方法Track-On，基于Transformer架构，无需未来帧信息，在七个公开基准上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景（如流媒体视频和具身AI）需要在线预测，现有离线方法无法满足。视觉基础模型虽能提供几何表示，但缺乏时序推理能力。

Method: 引入Track-On，基于Transformer的模型，将每个跟踪点视为查询，逐帧处理视频，利用记忆机制传递外观和上下文信息。

Result: 在七个公开基准上实现新SOTA，验证了无需未来帧的长时跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: Track-On证明了在线长时点跟踪的可行性，视觉基础模型可作为有效初始化，但需专用设计以维持时序一致性。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP）解决基础模型在视觉语言分类和医学分割任务中的分布偏移和置信度不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现出色，但面临训练与测试数据分布偏移和置信度不匹配的挑战，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出FIP减少嵌入空间的协变量偏移，CMP校准分割任务的不确定性，并通过理论分析证明其有效性。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集和医学分割任务中表现优异，如准确率提升3.5%，ECE降低28%，DSC达84.7%，HD95为4.8mm。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的框架，能无缝集成基础模型，显著提升跨域性能。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成先验的方法，从单视角的自我中心图像重建可动画的虚拟形象，利用Stable Diffusion减少训练负担并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖多视角数据集训练，而自我中心视角虽便携但存在遮挡和比例失真问题，缺乏基于生成先验的研究。

Method: 采用ControlNet和Stable Diffusion框架，从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实的正视图像，再输入到图像到运动模型中生成虚拟形象动作。

Result: 首次实现了从自我中心输入生成可动画的虚拟形象，减少了训练依赖并提升了泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法为更易用和通用的数字远程呈现系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为计算创造力和艺术教育提供了新见解。

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别方法存在上下文偏差问题，例如将背景与情感标签错误关联。

Result: 在CAER-S数据集上取得最优性能，验证了因果去偏的有效性。

Conclusion: AGCD-Net为复杂场景下的情感识别提供了鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊性方面存在不足，尤其是软正样本和软负样本的区分问题。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局和局部特征提取机制、自适应聚合网络，并利用GNN增强语义交互。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上，AAHR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AAHR有效解决了语义模糊性和高阶关系学习问题，提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无注释手语翻译方法模型复杂且计算需求高，难以扩展。

Method: 利用手语分段将连续视频转换为离散的视觉标记，并引入标记间对比对齐目标和双重监督。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中性能优于现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进的标记化和对齐策略，显著提升了无注释手语翻译的效率和性能。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Motivation: SNN在计算机视觉领域潜力大，但性能不及ANN，需通过知识蒸馏提升其在DVS数据上的表现。

Method: 利用RGB数据和ANN进行知识蒸馏，采用语义相似性、滑动替换和间接分阶段蒸馏解决跨模态和跨架构问题。

Result: 在N-Caltech101和CEP-DVS数据集上表现优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: CKD方法有效提升了SNN在DVS数据上的性能，解决了跨模态和跨架构挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: MLLMs在医疗领域的应用受到其提示敏感性和高置信度错误响应的限制，影响临床决策的可靠性。

Method: 提出Prompt4Trust框架，通过轻量级LLM生成辅助提示，优化下游MLLM的置信度校准和任务准确性。

Result: 在PMC-VQA基准测试中达到最先进的性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust展示了自动化提示工程在提升MLLMs可信度方面的潜力，尤其在安全关键领域。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 语义信息的引入显著提升了楼层平面图定位的准确性和效率，展示了语义感知框架的潜力。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Conclusion: ViT-ProtoNet为少样本分类提供了强大且灵活的解决方案，并成为Transformer元学习的新基准。

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Motivation: 路径平滑性在专家演示的路径模仿学习中常被忽视，因此需要一种方法来提高路径相似性。

Method: 结合PAF到A*算法中，通过自适应路径平滑性优化路径缩短和平滑。

Result: 在7个数据集上测试，DAA*在路径相似性和长度上优于现有方法，如神经A*和TransPath。

Conclusion: DAA*在路径最优性和搜索效率之间取得了平衡，显著提升了路径模仿学习的效果。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅使用8K图像训练的情况下，PSNR提高了4.9 dB，SSIM提高了3.2%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE在透明图像生成和重建方面表现出色，为RGBA图像研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on
https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

TL;DR: ProactiveBench是首个评估多模态对话系统主动交互能力的综合基准，并提出PAUC指标以考虑响应时间动态，更准确评估用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户期望多模态系统能更主动，例如在视频播放时实时决定多轮响应时机，但缺乏相关评估工具。

Method: 提出ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，通过基准测试和用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好，能更准确评估主动交互场景的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互提供了更可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态对话系统的发展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整类间混淆损失的音频-视频预训练编码器DICCAE，通过细粒度类别级对齐提升模型对相似活动的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练方法仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失，并引入结合音频、视频及其融合的新型训练框架。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过细粒度类别级对齐和动态混淆损失，显著提升模型对相似活动的区分能力。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Motivation: 3D MLLMs在场景理解方面表现优异，但计算效率低下限制了其实际部署，主要原因是处理过多的对象中心视觉令牌。

Method: 提出Fast3D框架，包含全局注意力预测（GAP）和样本自适应剪枝（SAP）技术，无需修改目标模型参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了Fast3D的有效性，尤其是在高剪枝率下表现突出。

Conclusion: Fast3D通过高效剪枝技术显著提升了3D MLLMs的计算效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 简单编码器架构结合预训练在交通异常检测中表现优异，超越复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练是否能让简单架构在交通异常检测中超越复杂设计。

Method: 使用Video ViTs和不同预训练策略（自监督、弱监督、全监督）进行研究。

Result: 强预训练使简单模型性能匹配或超越复杂方法，自监督MVM最有效。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合自监督预训练可高效实现交通异常检测。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly

Conclusion: 模型高效且性能优越，适用于多人物运动预测任务。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，导航系统成功率95%，综合准确率达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效可靠且隐私友好，为老年人跌倒检测提供了安全解决方案。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Result: CKAA在实验中优于现有PEFT-based CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过创新方法显著提升了模型鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Motivation: 视觉和语义概念通常以层次结构存在，但如何更高效地训练模型以捕捉和利用这种层次结构仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出HMID-Net，在双曲空间中整合掩码图像建模（MIM）和知识蒸馏技术，并设计了一种专门的双曲空间蒸馏损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP等现有模型。

Conclusion: HMID-Net证明了在双曲空间中应用MIM和知识蒸馏技术的有效性，为高效模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个专门设计用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正理解视频的基准测试，强调超越静态图像线索的全面视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试往往类似于基于图像的测试，模型仅需扫描关键帧即可回答问题，无法评估LVLMs是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个高度视觉中心的问题，涵盖11个类别，所有问题需观看完整视频并进行上下文推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，但最佳LVLM（GPT-o3）仅达66.43%，显示LVLMs在深度视频理解上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在真正理解视频方面的不足，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应的张量正则化网络（SDTN）和轻量级的张量正则化网络（TRN），用于高光谱图像分类，解决了高维数据和标签稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标签稀缺时表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合张量分解和正则化机制动态调整张量秩，并通过轻量级网络捕获多尺度特征。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上表现出更高的分类精度和更少的模型参数。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限环境，具有实时部署潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ReTA方法通过一致性感知熵重加权和多样性驱动的分布校准，提升了视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据的情况下，面对分布偏移时性能下降，需要更可靠的测试时适应方法。

Method: 提出ReTA方法，结合一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC），分别解决熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活的问题。

Result: ReTA在多种分布偏移场景下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略显著提升了视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Result: F1分数为38.03，比之前最佳方法提升了37.9%，排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势在线识别任务中表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

*Tien-Yu Chi,Hung-Yueh Chiang,Diana Marculescu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，且无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VMamba等基于SSM的视觉骨干模型在四向扫描中存在空间冗余问题，限制了其效率。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，通过剪枝冗余激活和最近邻上采样恢复维度，优化扫描效率。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，VMamba的吞吐量提升11%，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上也表现类似优势。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的部署效率工具，适用于SSM模型，且不影响迁移性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，通过最优传输理论和细节保留正则化，生成高质量去雾图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 利用Schrödinger Bridge直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，结合细节保留正则化和提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过最优传输和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的标记化策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，并在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉标记化方法效率低下，导致计算冗余和内存浪费。

Method: 采用内容感知的标记化策略，根据文档复杂度生成标记，并结合三阶段训练范式。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，减少图像标记数量约3.6倍，零样本评估中F1分数提升5.5点。

Conclusion: 内容感知标记化与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在红外小目标检测中过于依赖复杂架构，忽视了目标稀疏性的固有先验，导致模型效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出动态RPCA网络（DRPCA-Net），通过超网络动态生成迭代参数，并结合动态残差组（DRG）模块优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net的检测精度显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态展开机制和稀疏先验的结合，为红外小目标检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Method: 提出了Deformable Refinement Network（DeRefNet），包含Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment（TDFA）模块，用于自适应帧间信息聚合。

Result: 在SeqCSIST数据集上，DeRefNet的平均精度（mAP）比现有方法提高了5.3%。

Conclusion: 这是首个在多帧范式中解决CSIST Unmixing任务的工作，数据集和工具包已开源。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视TIP和手腕关节的重要性，导致远端关节误差累积，影响整体姿态估计质量。

Method: EHPE分为TW阶段（提取TIP和手腕）和PG阶段（双分支交互网络优化其余关节）。

Result: 在两个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段设计有效减少误差累积，提升手部姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available
at https://github.com/SereinNout/EHPE.

Result: 系统能高质量生成单字符和多字符的艺术字体，支持多语言和多样化工作流程。

Conclusion: WordCraft提升了艺术字体合成的交互性，为艺术家和设计师提供了更多创作可能。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在手术视频分割中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical

Motivation: 解决密集令牌方法处理速度慢与稀疏令牌方法分割质量低之间的权衡问题。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中达到SOTA性能，且在CPU设备上高效运行。

Conclusion: Inter2Former在效率和分割质量之间取得了平衡，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上平均性能提升2.78%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态跨模态交互和伪标签优化，显著提升了无监督适应任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: GAA是一个基于区域引导的少样本异常图像-掩码对生成框架，通过预训练的潜在扩散模型生成真实、多样且语义对齐的异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常样本稀缺，现有方法在定位和分类任务中效果有限，且现有异常合成方法存在真实性低、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GAA利用局部概念分解联合建模异常的语义特征和空间信息，通过自适应多轮异常聚类增强异常表示一致性，并采用区域引导的掩码生成策略确保异常与掩码对齐。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA通过结合区域引导和少样本学习，显著提升了异常合成的真实性和实用性，为工业制造中的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Conclusion: 解缠技术在眼底成像中效果复杂，强调医疗AI需关注公平性以确保解决方案的公平可靠。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性建模显著提升了眼部分割的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于AR/VR应用。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Result: 令牌压缩技术在通用ViT上有效，但在紧凑设计中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 为未来研究适应紧凑Transformer网络的令牌优化技术提供了方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Motivation: 传统变分分数蒸馏（VSD）在实践中存在收敛慢和不适定问题，论文旨在通过优化分数模型与3D模型的交互来改进生成质量。

Method: 提出线性化前瞻变分分数蒸馏（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和使用线性化模型解决VSD的不稳定问题。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD通过前瞻优化和线性化改进，显著提升了文本到3D生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了兼容性性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时，容易将分布内样本误判为OOD，尤其是当负标签是分布内标签的子类或专有名词时。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除负标签集中的子类标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，动态调整匹配图像的多个标签的贡献。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现出更鲁棒的分布内和OOD样本分离能力。

Conclusion: NegRefine通过负标签细化和多匹配感知评分，显著提升了零样本OOD检测的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估MLLMs在VRU安全场景中能力的空白，并揭示了其推理能力的局限性。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

Result: 点变换器模型在全局3D形状表征上更接近人类表现。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型的层次抽象机制使其在3D形状识别中更接近人类视觉。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

Abstract: Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field,
driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex
visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to
extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews
recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1)
methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2)
training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response
tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets
utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning.
Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and
propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant
breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer
high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to
focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual
human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M
dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视频推理范式ViTCoT，结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本信息进行推理，忽视了视觉模态的重要性，而人类在推理时会自然结合视觉内容。

Method: 构建了Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB)，并提出了ViTCoT范式，结合视觉和文本信息进行推理。

Result: 实验表明ViTCoT显著优于传统文本CoT范式，并能激活更多神经元值。

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频理解领域提供了一种更直观且认知对齐的推理方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实视觉解释方法忽视因果关系和虚假相关性，导致解释质量受限。

Method: 提出CECAS框架，结合因果视角生成反事实解释，避免虚假因素扰动。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，平衡了有效性、稀疏性、接近性和真实性。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果引导显著提升了反事实解释的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCGA是一种两阶段方法，通过先学习光谱模式再估计映射，解决了RGB到HSI转换的挑战，并引入注意力机制提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽略了从低维到高维信息转换的固有挑战。

Method: MCGA采用两阶段方法：1) 多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式；2) 通过查询MoC优化映射，并引入灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力。

Result: MCGA在实验中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过两阶段设计和注意力机制，高效且轻量地重建HSI，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中物体方向任意，旋转等变性对检测器至关重要，但现有方法多为近似等变，严格等变的必要性尚不明确。

Method: 实现严格旋转等变的骨干和颈部网络，提出多分支头网络以减少参数并提升精度。

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0、DOTA-v1.5和DIOR-R数据集上取得最佳性能，且参数极少。

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变对航空图像检测器性能有显著提升，多分支头网络有效减少参数并提高精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Motivation: 现有图形设计方法缺乏创造力和智能化，依赖布局生成或生成不可编辑的图像文件，导致设计过程仍费时费力。

Method: IGD采用新范式，结合参数化渲染和图像资产生成，利用MLLM的多模态理解能力预测属性、排序和布局，并用扩散模型生成图像内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，IGD在复杂图形设计任务中具有优越性能，提供了新的解决方案。

Conclusion: IGD为图形设计提供了可扩展和可扩展的端到端训练架构，显著提升了自动化设计的实用性和创造力。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

TL;DR: Crucial-Diff框架通过生成关键样本解决数据稀缺问题，提升检测和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成方法样本重复且无法针对模型弱点。

Method: 提出Crucial-Diff框架，包含SAFE和WASM模块，生成多样且高质量的样本。

Result: 在MVTec和息肉数据集上分别达到83.63% AP和81.64% mIoU。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff有效解决数据稀缺问题，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在时尚产品属性识别中的潜力，尤其是在零样本设置下的性能。

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，仅以图像为输入，评估模型在18类时尚属性上的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.0 Flash更适合电商产品属性识别任务，未来需研究领域特定的微调方法。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Result: 在超低剂量条件下实现了与传统ptychography相当的空间分辨率，适用于非晶、半晶和晶态材料。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

### [105] [Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009)
*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种图像序列二项式自补偿（I-BSC）方法，用于解决相位移动轮廓测量（PSP）在动态测量中的运动误差问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSP在动态测量中因物体运动导致误差，现有方法P-BSC虽有效但计算开销大且误差累积。

Method: I-BSC通过对同质条纹图像加权求和，仅需一次反正切计算，解决了P-BSC的多帧相位计算和加权求和问题。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现了准单帧速率，计算帧速率提升数倍至数十倍，且误差收敛更快。

Conclusion: I-BSC在动态3D扫描中显著提升了性能，兼具高精度和高效计算。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

*Tom Kouwenhoven,Kiana Shahrasbi,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究重新评估了两种CLIP变体（ResNet和ViT）在bouba-kiki效应中的表现，发现它们未能一致展现人类认知中的跨模态关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言模型（VLMs）是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，对比人类实验数据。

Result: 模型未表现出稳定的bouba-kiki效应，且与人类数据相比表现显著不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解和人类直觉对齐方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyma提出了一种基于超网络的多模态模型对齐方法，显著降低了最优单模态模型选择和连接器训练的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型通常通过拼接现有单模态模型实现，但选择和训练连接器模块的计算成本高，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，为多种单模态模型组合联合训练连接器模块。

Result: Hyma将最优单模态模型对搜索成本降低10倍，同时性能与网格搜索相当。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型对齐方法，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在边缘设备上适应文本到图像扩散模型时的内存效率和隐私保护问题。

Method: 通过时间步感知的概率函数动态选择BP-low或ZO-high优化策略，结合两者的优势。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著降低内存消耗的同时保持了高性能，支持高质量设备端个性化。

Conclusion: 该框架为内存高效的设备端个性化提供了一种有效解决方案，同时不增加推理延迟。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging
ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for
scalable comic book analysis.

Method: 采用多颜色空间特征提取和多种描述符，结合PCA和XGBoost降维，使用ANN分类器。

Result: 模型准确率达95.85%，无需GPU，执行时间仅638秒，资源消耗远低于深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源农业环境提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的疾病检测方案。

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Result: 在多个任务中验证了MoVieS的有效性和高效性，实现了竞争性性能并显著提升速度。

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模动态场景，支持零样本应用，并在速度和性能上表现优异。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成能力上表现出色，但受曝光偏差影响较大。研究发现预测噪声图像的能量在扩散过程中减少，且低频和高频子带的能量减少模式不同，导致重建数据与真实数据之间的振幅差异。

Method: 引入频率域调节机制，利用小波变换分别调整低频和高频子带，并基于能量减少模式分析曝光偏差。

Result: 方法无需训练且即插即用，显著提升了多种扩散模型的生成质量，有效解决了不同模型架构中的曝光偏差问题。

Conclusion: 通过频率域调节机制，论文提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，显著改善了扩散模型的生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Motivation: 解决遥感图像水体分割中因域偏移和小样本量导致的模型性能下降问题。

Result: 在西藏札达土林区域，IoU从25.50%提升至64.84%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了域差异问题，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Result: FIX-CLIP在长短文本检索任务中达到SOTA，且适用于扩散模型的长文本输入。

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效解决了CLIP的长文本限制，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

Motivation: 解决像素级标注成本高的问题，利用基础模型提升半监督分割效果。

Method: 结合无监督掩码变换器一致性和CLIP特征的零样本分类增强识别，通过SAM伪标签进行类无关解码器预热增强定位。

Result: 在ADE20K上仅用158张标注图像达到29.9 PQ和38.9 mIoU，性能优于现有方法且GPU内存需求更低。

Conclusion: DEARLi在标签稀缺和大分类场景下表现优异，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Conclusion: 点跟踪方法在超声心动图中有潜力，但需针对特定领域优化，简单模型在某些情况下可能优于复杂模型。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 反馈机制提高了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更自适应和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

Abstract: Concrete workability is essential for construction quality, with the slump
test being the most common on-site method for its assessment. However,
traditional slump testing is manual, time-consuming, and prone to
inconsistency, limiting its applicability for real-time monitoring. To address
these challenges, we propose SlumpGuard, an AI-powered, video-based system that
automatically analyzes concrete flow from the truck chute to assess workability
in real time. Our system enables full-batch inspection without manual
intervention, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of quality control. We
present the system design, a the construction of a dedicated dataset, and
empirical results from real-world deployment, demonstrating the effectiveness
of SlumpGuard as a practical solution for modern concrete quality assurance.

Conclusion: 双级别域适应方法有效解决了域差距问题，显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are
available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.

TL;DR: ECP框架通过两阶段方法提升多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像上的性能，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像上因固定分辨率导致的细粒度定位和推理能力不足问题。

Method: 提出ECP框架：先通过降采样图像获取粗略预测，再基于候选区域进行最终预测。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效保留细节并提升性能，适用于高分辨率图像任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为多模态学习性能不佳是由于模态间学习不平衡，但本文认为不平衡学习反而是最优设置。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差比例重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差联合优化。

Result: 实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性，且无需额外参数。

Conclusion: ARL通过不平衡优化显著提升多模态学习性能，且适用于不同结构和融合方法。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Conclusion: 情绪表达并非完全普遍，种族背景在微表情识别中具有重要影响。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 多模态学习中，现有方法未能解释为何主导模态在多模态模型中表现不如单模态学习，作者发现优化冲突是主要原因。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失对模态编码器的梯度，并用单模态损失梯度替代，同时移除单模态损失对融合模块的梯度。

Result: 实验表明DGL在多种模态、任务和框架中均有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL通过解耦优化过程，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在个性化人像生成中需要推理时微调或大规模数据集训练，计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用LoRA层训练，结合衣柜条件和空间参考减少信息丢失，并引入选择性主体区域损失。

Result: 在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，支持少样本训练且无需额外推理参数。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA在高效性和生成质量上表现优异，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Method: 提出VRFNO框架，结合编码器和神经速度场，引入历史速度项和噪声优化技术，优化耦合并提升轨迹预测准确性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，在单步和少步生成任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决了Reflow的局限性，为高质量快速图像生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法通常计算成本高且参数多，SL旨在通过维度提升实现高效、准确的预测。

Method: SL将2D图像等输入提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集上验证，SL在保持性能的同时，模型参数减少98%以上，推理成本降低。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 在ImageNet上AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界样本和模型微调，显著提升了OOD检测能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: KBA方法通过多折叠径向对称和优化策略，显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Motivation: 传统Transformer架构将图像嵌入为均匀的网格标记，忽略了语义信息，导致特征表示不理想。

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，分类性能提升显著，最高达1.43%。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的标记生成，显著提升了图像分类效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

*Wenkang Han,Wang Lin,Yiyun Zhou,Qi Liu,Shulei Wang,Chang Yao,Jingyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IP-FVR是一种新方法，通过参考图像提供身份条件，结合交叉注意力和反馈学习，有效恢复高质量人脸视频并保持身份一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化情况下难以保留细粒度和身份特征，导致结果缺乏个体特性。

Method: IP-FVR利用参考图像作为视觉提示，采用解耦交叉注意力机制和反馈学习方法，结合指数混合策略和多流负提示。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，IP-FVR在质量和身份保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频恢复中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

*Hatef Otroshi Shahreza,Sébastien Marcel*

TL;DR: FaceLLM是一种专门用于面部图像理解的多模态大语言模型，通过ChatGPT生成的弱监督数据训练，提升了在面部相关任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力，尤其是对面部结构、表情、情感和人口统计特征的详细理解。

Method: 使用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的属性感知问答对，构建高质量训练数据FairFaceGPT，并训练FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部中心任务上提升了MLLMs的性能，并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在构建领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖、以人为中心的多模态AI系统树立了先例。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一种新颖的视频多模态大语言模型视觉封装方法，通过视觉概念判别器和时间焦点校准器解决语义模糊和时间不连贯问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性投影器在视频封装中导致语义模糊和时间不连贯，而重采样器结构虽有效但未充分探索。

Method: DisCo包含视觉概念判别器（VCD）和时间焦点校准器（TFC），分别确保语义清晰和时间一致性。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，DisCo显著优于现有方法，同时提高了标记效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLMs提供了一种高效且语义清晰的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

*Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双视觉编码器的无注释手语翻译框架，通过对比视觉-语言预训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵且不完整的注释，无法充分捕捉连续手语的复杂性。

Method: 采用两阶段双视觉编码器框架，预训练时通过对比目标对齐视觉和文本嵌入，下游任务时融合视觉特征输入编码器-解码器模型。

Result: 在Phoenix-2014T基准测试中，双编码器架构优于单流变体，并在无注释方法中取得最高BLEU-4分数。

Conclusion: 双视觉编码器框架为无注释手语翻译提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IMD的框架，利用预训练扩散模型解决图像特征匹配中的对齐问题，显著提升了多实例场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将基础模型引入特征匹配时忽略了单图像理解与跨图像理解之间的不对齐问题，导致多实例特征匹配效果不佳。

Method: IMD框架包含两部分：1) 使用生成式扩散模型捕捉实例级细节；2) 提出跨图像交互提示模块，促进图像对之间的双向信息交互。

Result: IMD在常用基准测试中达到新SOTA，在提出的IMIM基准上性能提升12%，有效缓解了对齐问题。

Conclusion: 通过引入扩散模型和跨图像交互机制，IMD显著改善了特征匹配中的对齐问题，尤其在多实例场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成任务中表现出色，但计算复杂度高，限制了其在资源受限环境中的应用。现有量化方法未考虑输入条件（如文本提示）的重要性。

Method: 提出QLIP方法，利用文本提示动态选择每层和每个时间步的比特精度，并可无缝集成到现有量化方法中。

Result: 实验表明，QLIP能有效降低计算复杂度，并在多个数据集上提升生成图像质量。

Conclusion: QLIP通过结合文本提示优化量化过程，为高效扩散模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Method: 使用U-Net分割主干和多头部专用特征提取器，提取领域特定特征图并注入U-Net的潜在空间以指导分割过程。

Result: 实验表明，注入特征后性能优于普通U-Net。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，特征引导的分割过程显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机图模型的文本适配器VRGAdapter，用于捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，并通过不确定性引导的多分支融合提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性文本适配器无法充分捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，限制了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的潜力。

Method: 利用顶点随机知识图（VRKG）建模类别描述的多样性和类间关系，通过概率消息传播学习上下文感知的分布表示，并采用重参数化采样实现适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，并通过UMF方案提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象，而现实场景中常需区分细节差异小的细粒度对象（如不同鸟类、鱼类和花卉）。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在FGZSD-Birds数据集上的实验表明，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了细粒度零样本目标检测问题，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Method: FOCAL通过生成和优化候选变换，将其导向视觉典型的“规范”视图，从而提升鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，FOCAL显著提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，提供了一种可扩展的鲁棒性实现路径。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能捕捉几何信息，结合两者可以弥补CNN的局限性。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程管道，并将其与ResNet18模型结合，用于遥感图像分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到99.33%的准确率，超过ResNet50和XL Vision Transformers；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征可以与深度学习模型结合，即使在没有显式拓扑结构的数据集上也能提升性能，扩展了TDA的应用范围。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统主要局限于RGB数据，未能充分利用其他传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的独特物理信息。

Method: 提出了CLOSP框架，通过文本作为桥梁，将未配对的光学和SAR图像对齐到统一嵌入空间；GeoCLOSP进一步整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP在检索性能上提升了54%，GeoCLOSP在位置依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多样传感器数据和地理上下文的整合对释放遥感档案的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析显著提升了AI生成图像质量的评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 4D-Animal是一种无需稀疏关键点标注即可从视频重建可动画3D动物的新框架，通过密集特征网络和分层对齐策略提高效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点，但获取成本高且不可靠，因此提出无需关键点标注的解决方案。

Method: 引入密集特征网络将2D表示映射到SMAL参数，并结合分层对齐策略整合多种视觉线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基线方法，生成的高质量3D资产可支持其他3D任务。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal在效率和准确性上表现优异，具有大规模应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoralVQA是首个用于珊瑚礁分析的大规模VQA数据集，包含12,805张真实珊瑚图像和277,653个问答对，为珊瑚礁监测提供专业支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 珊瑚礁监测需要专业领域知识，现有VQA技术缺乏针对珊瑚图像的专用数据集。

Method: 开发半自动数据构建流程，结合海洋生物学家合作，确保数据质量和可扩展性。

Result: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像的多维分析提供基准，揭示了现有LVLM的局限性。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为未来LVLM开发提供基础，支持珊瑚保护工作。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

*Tao Tang,Chengxu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的遥感图像融合方法，显著提升了空间细节提取精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制平衡空间细节与光谱保真。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPNet的自适应组件有效提升了遥感图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的盲人脸图像修复方法RefSTAR，通过参考图像的选择、转移和重建，解决了身份保留问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在引入辅助信息时难以保留身份特征，主要由于纹理细节的特征引入不当。

Method: 构建了参考选择模块（RefSel），设计了特征融合范式以避免交叉注意力的平凡解，并提出了参考图像重建机制。

Result: 在各种骨干模型上的实验表明，该方法在身份保留和参考特征转移质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: RefSTAR通过有效整合参考图像特征，显著提升了盲人脸图像修复的效果。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 图像时间戳预测与地理定位密切相关，现有方法未充分解决两者的相互依赖问题。

Method: GT-Loc使用独立编码器对齐图像、时间和位置的嵌入，并采用循环时间度量学习目标。

Result: 在时间预测和地理定位任务上均优于现有方法，且支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Conclusion: 联合优化时间和地理信息的方法有效提升了预测性能，并扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度的自蒸馏方法，用于减少深度学习模型在结肠镜息肉分割中的过拟合问题，同时提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在息肉分割中表现优异但参数过多，容易过拟合且泛化能力差，知识蒸馏和自蒸馏虽有效但资源消耗大。

Method: 提出一种仅需存储前一次迭代数据的置信度自蒸馏方法，通过动态置信系数计算损失，减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在息肉分割任务中，该方法优于现有模型，并在多临床中心数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少资源需求和提高泛化能力，为息肉分割提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Motivation: 现有视网膜异常检测领域缺乏公开的基准，导致方法评估受限，且现有方法未能充分利用临床数据。

Method: 提出了NFM-DRA方法，结合解耦异常表示（DRA）和正常特征记忆（NFM）机制，以提升性能。

Result: NFM-DRA在基准测试中表现最佳，但某些未见异常仍会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: BenchReAD基准填补了领域空白，NFM-DRA方法显著提升了异常检测性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.

TL;DR: 论文比较了多视角Transformer中相机几何条件化的方法，提出了一种新的相对位置编码PRoPE，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角计算机视觉任务中，相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，需要有效的方法将其融入Transformer。

Method: 比较了token级射线图编码、attention级相对位姿编码和新提出的PRoPE，后者完整捕捉相机内外参数。

Result: PRoPE在多种任务（如新视角合成、深度估计）中表现优异，尤其在泛化性和模型规模扩展时效果显著。

Conclusion: PRoPE是一种有效的相机几何条件化方法，适用于多视角Transformer任务。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小农户农业系统中农田分布和规模的基础数据不足问题，以支持科学政策制定。

Method: 结合高分辨率（1.5米）遥感数据和深度迁移学习，最小化参考数据需求并提升模型迁移能力。

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克全国农田地图，精度高（IoU中位数0.81），捕捉了全球地图未覆盖的碎片化农田区域。

Conclusion: 农田规模是农业社会经济和环境结果的关键指标，研究为可持续农业政策提供了重要数据支持。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

TL;DR: ReVQ框架通过预训练的VAE快速训练VQ-VAE，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练高压缩率的VQ-VAE计算成本高，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 使用预训练的VAE，结合通道多组量化和后置整流器，减少量化误差。

Result: 在ImageNet上压缩至512个token，保持高质量重建（rFID=1.06），训练成本降低两个数量级。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量之间实现了优越的权衡。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

TL;DR: EmRACE-3K是一个包含3000多个任务的视觉语言模型数据集，用于评估和提升模型在交互式环境中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现良好，但在需要在线交互和主动场景理解的具身环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用Unreal Engine和UnrealCV-Zoo框架构建多样化、逼真的环境，并设计多步任务轨迹，结合视觉观察、指令和自然语言解释。

Result: 零样本测试中，所有模型成功率低于20%；通过微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K有效推动了具身推理能力的发展，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 自监督学习在生物多样性监测中潜力巨大，为可扩展、非侵入性种群研究铺平道路。

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast
amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual
animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully
self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

Result: 在三个多光谱点云数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升多光谱点云在复杂场景下的分类性能。

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: OTAS是一种用于户外分割的开放词汇标记对齐方法，通过直接从预训练视觉模型的输出标记中提取语义结构，克服了开放词汇分割模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于对象中心分割先验的视觉语言映射方法在户外环境中常因语义模糊和边界不清而失败，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: OTAS通过聚类单视图和多视图中的语义相似结构，并将其与语言对齐，构建几何一致的特征场，支持开放词汇分割查询。

Result: OTAS在零样本情况下运行，无需场景特定微调，速度达17 fps，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OTAS适用于机器人应用，代码和ROS节点将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Understanding open-world semantics is critical for robotic planning and
control, particularly in unstructured outdoor environments. Current
vision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors,
which often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic
class boundaries. We propose OTAS - an Open-vocabulary Token Alignment method
for Outdoor Segmentation. OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary
segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output
tokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar
structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language,
OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports
open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without
scene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor
IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on
the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset. Our model achieves up to a 151% IoU
improvement over open-vocabulary mapping methods in 3D segmentation on
TartanAir. Real-world reconstructions demonstrate OTAS' applicability to
robotic applications. The code and ROS node will be made publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 探索更通用的空间想象能力，解决机器人预测自身运动意图在三维空间中的结果这一基础问题。

Conclusion: AirScape为空中代理提供了有效的空间想象能力。

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions
in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied
intelligence. To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we
present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom
aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current
visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for
aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention
pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone
actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent
annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR制图成本高且慢，单车感知方法在恶劣条件下缺乏准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EGC-VMAP提供了一种可扩展、经济高效的城市级地图解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision vectorized maps are indispensable for autonomous driving, yet
traditional LiDAR-based creation is costly and slow, while single-vehicle
perception methods lack accuracy and robustness, particularly in adverse
conditions. This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that
overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps
through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior
approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements
perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture
within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for
efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly
enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle
baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP
demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution
for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation
costs.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Result: 提出了一种高效的强化学习框架，能够显著提升多指手的灵巧操作能力。

Conclusion: 通过直接解决计算传感器运动学习的根本限制，论文为机器人灵巧操作提供了新的学习范式。

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构稳定性验证和启发式规划的新框架，解决在线装箱问题中的稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法在体积利用率上表现优异，但无法保证装箱的结构稳定性，且缺乏安全重构机制。

Method: 引入负载可承受凸多边形（LBCP）进行稳定性验证，并提出稳定重排规划（SRP）模块。

Result: 实验表明LBCP验证高效且通用，SRP在节省重排成本上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际工业应用提供了鲁棒且实用的自动化装箱解决方案。

Abstract: The Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) is a sequential decision-making task in
which each item must be placed immediately upon arrival, with no knowledge of
future arrivals. Although recent deep-reinforcement-learning methods achieve
superior volume utilization compared with classical heuristics, the learned
policies cannot ensure the structural stability of the bin and lack mechanisms
for safely reconfiguring the bin when a new item cannot be placed directly. In
this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates packing policy with
structural stability validation and heuristic planning to overcome these
limitations. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Load Bearable Convex
Polygon (LBCP), which provides a computationally efficient way to identify
stable loading positions that guarantee no bin collapse. Additionally, we
present Stable Rearrangement Planning (SRP), a module that rearranges existing
items to accommodate new ones while maintaining overall stability. Extensive
experiments on standard OBPP benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and
generalizability of our LBCP-based stability validation, as well as the
superiority of SRP in finding the effort-saving rearrangement plans. Our method
offers a robust and practical solution for automated packing in real-world
industrial and logistics applications.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在物理交互中缺乏精细力控制，尤其在接触密集场景中。本文旨在扩展VLA的隐式知识，指导机器人如何与真实世界进行物理交互。

Method: 提出Tactile-VLA框架，结合混合力-位置控制器和触觉反馈推理模块，通过少量演示激活VLM的先验知识。

Conclusion: VLM的先验知识已包含物理交互的语义理解，通过触觉传感器连接可激活该知识，实现零样本泛化。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements,
driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components.
However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into
physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained
force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond
identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real
world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses
vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a
hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into
precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt
its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's
effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling
tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant
commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key
finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic
understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile
sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to
achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成可解任务，适用于机器人操作任务的训练和数据集构建。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for the procedural construction of multi-step
contact-rich manipulation tasks in robotics. Our generator takes as input
user-defined sets of atomic actions, objects, and spatial predicates and
outputs solvable tasks of a given length for the selected robotic environment.
The generator produces solvable tasks by constraining all possible
(nonsolvable) combinations by symbolic and physical validation. The symbolic
validation checks each generated sequence for logical and operational
consistency, and also the suitability of object-predicate relations. Physical
validation checks whether tasks can be solved in the selected robotic
environment. Only the tasks that passed both validators are retained. The
output from the generator can be directly interfaced with any existing
framework for training robotic manipulation tasks, or it can be stored as a
dataset of curated robotic tasks with detailed information about each task.
This is beneficial for RL training as there are dense reward functions and
initial and goal states paired with each subgoal. It allows the user to measure
the semantic similarity of all generated tasks. We tested our generator on
sequences of up to 15 actions resulting in millions of unique solvable
multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法在仿真和真实场景中均优于现有技术，无需专用基础设施或手动调参，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

Conclusion: HZ-MP在非凸自由空间中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Optimal path planning in nonconvex free spaces is notoriously challenging, as
formulating such problems as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) is NP-hard.
We propose HZ-MP, an informed Hybrid Zonotope-based Motion Planner, as an
alternative approach that decomposes the obstacle-free space and performs
low-dimensional face sampling guided by an ellipsotope heuristic, enabling
focused exploration along promising transit regions. This structured
exploration eliminates the excessive, unreachable sampling that degrades
existing informed planners such as AIT* and EIT* in narrow gaps or boxed-goal
scenarios. We prove that HZ-MP is probabilistically complete and asymptotically
optimal. It converges to near-optimal trajectories in finite time and scales to
high-dimensional cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.

Result: C-ZUPT显著减少惯性漂移和控制能耗，提升导航稳定性。

Conclusion: C-ZUPT为资源受限的空中系统提供了更高效的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for
drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and
cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many
environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors,
leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise.
To counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information
aiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update
(ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during
stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This
work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and
control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold,
C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates
to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these
opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and
control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances
navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially
extending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持任务性能的同时，有效学习演示中的风格，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring
natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly
when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging.
Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing
task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on
expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical
demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to
boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we
propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints
to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively
adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations
selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance.
We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks,
demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On
ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile
gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning
framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential

approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling
efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The
framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local
potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic
scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model
and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation,
demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial

Abstract: Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant
challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash
effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance.
Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as
collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect.
This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation
of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense
environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the
downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding
forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor
configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize
vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the
spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting
pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies
for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the
envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have emerged as versatile platforms, driving
the demand for accurate modeling to support developmental testing. This paper
proposes data-driven modeling software for UAV. Emphasizes the utilization of
cost-effective sensors to obtain orientation and location data subsequently
processed through the application of data filtering algorithms and sensor
fusion techniques to improve the data quality to make a precise model
visualization on the software. UAV's orientation is obtained using processed
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and represented using Quaternion
Representation to avoid the gimbal lock problem. The UAV's location is
determined by combining data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which
provides stable geographic coordinates but slower data update frequency, and
the accelerometer, which has higher data update frequency but integrating it to
get position data is unstable due to its accumulative error. By combining data
from these two sensors, the software is able to calculate and continuously
update the UAV's real-time position during its flight operations. The result
shows that the software effectively renders UAV orientation and position with
high degree of accuracy and fluidity

Abstract: For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should
real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated
spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization
accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to
mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we upgrade
traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in
sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and
introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system
designed for precise drone landings. To fully exploit the \textit{temporal
consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these two modalities,
we propose two innovative modules: \textit{(i)} the Consistency-instructed
Collaborative Tracking module, which further leverages the drone's physical
knowledge of periodic micro-motions and structure for accurate measurements
extraction, and \textit{(ii)} the Graph-informed Adaptive Joint Optimization
module, which integrates drone motion information for efficient sensor fusion
and drone localization. Real-world experiments conducted in landing scenarios
with a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and latency.

Abstract: Autonomous trucking offers significant benefits, such as improved safety and
reduced costs, but faces unique perception challenges due to trucks' large size
and dynamic trailer movements. These challenges include extensive blind spots
and occlusions that hinder the truck's perception and the capabilities of other
road users. To address these limitations, cooperative perception emerges as a
promising solution. However, existing datasets predominantly feature light
vehicle interactions or lack multi-agent configurations for heavy-duty vehicle
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruckV2X, the first large-scale
truck-centered cooperative perception dataset featuring multi-modal sensing
(LiDAR and cameras) and multi-agent cooperation (tractors, trailers, CAVs, and
RSUs). We further investigate how trucks influence collaborative perception
needs, establishing performance benchmarks while suggesting research priorities
for heavy vehicle perception. The dataset provides a foundation for developing
cooperative perception systems with enhanced occlusion handling capabilities,
and accelerates the deployment of multi-agent autonomous trucking systems. The

TL;DR: Plan-MAE是一个基于掩码自编码器的预训练框架，用于预测和规划，通过多任务学习提升自动驾驶车辆的轨迹规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖模仿学习，忽略了场景理解对整体轨迹规划的重要性，Plan-MAE旨在通过多任务学习弥补这一不足。

Method: Plan-MAE通过三个任务（道路网络重建、轨迹建模和导航路线捕捉）学习上下文，并加入局部子规划任务以对齐车辆动态和安全约束。

Result: 实验表明，Plan-MAE在规划指标上大幅优于现有方法，可作为基于学习的运动规划器的重要预训练步骤。

Conclusion: Plan-MAE通过多任务预训练和上下文融合，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的预测和规划能力。

Abstract: Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe,
goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods
typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground
truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic
trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining
framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders.
Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks:
reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent
trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture
destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints,
we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term
trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is
subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction
and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that
Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin
and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion
planner.

Result: 通过调整LIF神经元的膜电位泄漏常数，SNN在避障任务中达到了与CNN相当的精度。

Conclusion: 研究表明SNN在机器人导航中具有潜力，并开源了LIDAR数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that
by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to
achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during
this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future
research.

Conclusion: IteraOptiRacing策略在计算负担低、适合并行计算的情况下，显著提升了自动驾驶赛车的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with
other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments.
This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the
presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's
historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost
optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in
collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's
constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable
real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its
performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with
multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated
autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing
car.

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一种生物基础、资源高效的自主视觉归巢解决方案。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态预测和主动探测方面表现出色，适用于现实世界的自动驾驶导航挑战。

Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios
with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust
performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad
applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定位置执行器（如交通信号）在多样化交通场景中表现有限，需要一种能适应不同场景的拉格朗日交通控制方法。

Method: 提出MRMEL框架，结合残差强化学习和混合专家学习，动态选择最优控制策略并学习残差修正。

Result: 在真实交通场景中，MRMEL比基线方法额外减少4%-9%的车辆排放。

Conclusion: MRMEL为复杂交通环境中的拉格朗日控制提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

Conclusion: AdvGrasp为机器人抓取的对抗攻击提供了新视角，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on robotic grasping provide valuable insights into
evaluating and improving the robustness of these systems. Unlike studies that
focus solely on neural network predictions while overlooking the physical
principles of grasping, this paper introduces AdvGrasp, a framework for
adversarial attacks on robotic grasping from a physical perspective.
Specifically, AdvGrasp targets two core aspects: lift capability, which
evaluates the ability to lift objects against gravity, and grasp stability,
which assesses resistance to external disturbances. By deforming the object's
shape to increase gravitational torque and reduce stability margin in the
wrench space, our method systematically degrades these two key grasping
metrics, generating adversarial objects that compromise grasp performance.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the effectiveness of
AdvGrasp, while real-world validations demonstrate its robustness and practical
applicability

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了谐波势场的应用范围，适用于更复杂的工作空间。

Abstract: Safe navigation within a workspace is a fundamental skill for autonomous
robots to accomplish more complex tasks. Harmonic potentials are artificial
potential fields that are analytical, globally convergent and provably free of
local minima. Thus, it has been widely used for generating safe and reliable
robot navigation control policies. However, most existing methods do not allow
customization of the harmonic potential fields nor the resulting paths,
particularly regarding their topological properties. In this paper, we propose
a novel method that automatically finds homotopy classes of paths that can be
generated by valid harmonic potential fields. The considered complex workspaces
can be as general as forest worlds consisting of numerous overlapping
star-obstacles. The method is based on a hybrid optimization algorithm that
searches over homotopy classes, selects the structure of each tree-of-stars
within the forest, and optimizes over the continuous weight parameters for each
purged tree via the projected gradient descent. The key insight is to transform
the forest world to the unbounded point world via proper diffeomorphic
transformations. It not only facilitates a simpler design of the
multi-directional D-signature between non-homotopic paths, but also retain the
safety and convergence properties. Extensive simulations and hardware
experiments are conducted for non-trivial scenarios, where the navigation
potentials are customized for desired homotopic properties. Project page:

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for
addressing complex control problems, particularly those involving underactuated

achieve optimal performance and robustness aligned with specific task
objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach for fine-tuning Deep RL
policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to enhance control performance for
underactuated robots. Our method involves initially training an RL agent with
Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to
approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this
learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable
Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score.
Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with
RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning
significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The
resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive
scores for the competition tasks.

Abstract: This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as

Conclusion: TGLD框架通过动态信任评估和社会兼容性设计，实现了自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆的高效、安全和透明交互。

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate

Abstract: The rapid emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has introduced a transformative
paradigm in robotics. These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic
understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling
significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot
interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent
developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design,
open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike
existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights
integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility
in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene
generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed
alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal
data, safety risks, and computational constraints. Through this lens, this
paper identifies both the architectural strengths and critical limitations of
foundation model-based robotics, highlighting open challenges in real-time
operation, grounding, resilience, and trust. The review concludes with a
roadmap for future research aimed at bridging semantic reasoning and physical
intelligence through more robust, interpretable, and embodied models.

Result: 在ergoCub机器人上验证，扭矩跟踪精度、能量效率和抗干扰能力优于现有RNEA方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无传感器扭矩控制提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of
humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with
electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented
Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque
control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from
joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation
without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as
direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental
validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking
accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection
compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using
a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by
consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different
friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative
analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque
control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical
solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque
tracking, adaptability, and stability in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: GUIDER是一个概率框架，通过双阶段估计人类意图，提升人机协作中的导航和操作稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确推断人类意图可以避免人机冲突，同时不限制人类控制。

Method: GUIDER采用双阶段框架：导航阶段结合控制器速度和占用网格；操作阶段融合U2Net、FastSAM和几何抓取可行性测试。

Result: 在25次试验中，导航稳定性达93-100%，操作稳定性达94-100%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GUIDER在移动操作任务中显著提升了意图推断的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 大多数强化学习方法将并行机制简化为串行模型，忽略了关节耦合等关键因素，影响了仿真到现实的迁移效果。

Method: 采用对称感知损失函数、对抗训练和针对性网络正则化，结合闭链动力学进行训练。

Result: 在自定义机器人TopA上验证，实现了跨地形稳定运动，显著优于简化模型方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合闭链动力学的强化学习框架能有效提升双足机器人的运动控制性能。

Abstract: Developing robust locomotion controllers for bipedal robots with closed
kinematic chains presents unique challenges, particularly since most
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simplify these parallel mechanisms into
serial models during training. We demonstrate that this simplification
significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential
aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control
characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly
incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot
TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss
functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable
locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based
on simplified kinematic models.

Conclusion: REACT有效解决了缆绳缠绕问题，提升了水下检查任务的效率和安全性。

Abstract: Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法缺乏语义适应性，需改进以适应复杂任务。

Method: PIRL利用GPT-3.5的语义反馈动态调整PPO的奖励函数，结合好奇心驱动RL。

Result: PIRL在视觉覆盖、电池效率和冗余度上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM引导的奖励塑形在复杂空间任务中有效，为RL与自然语言结合提供新方向。

Abstract: Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires
agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize
coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward
formulations that lack semantic adaptability. This study proposes
Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates
the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large
language models with curiosity-driven RL. PIRL leverages semantic feedback from
an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera
adjustments for optimal visual coverage. The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI
Gym and evaluated in various environments. Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like
ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the
agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics. Results
show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with
static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning,
and an LLM-only controller. Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the
best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in
OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and
up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment. The results
highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial
exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural
language priors into RL for robotics.

Motivation: 现有轨迹优化方法在处理大规模长轨迹时效率不足，并行计算的应用潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Conclusion: 新框架在效率和平滑性上优于现有方法，适用于现代并行计算架构。

Abstract: Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.

TL;DR: 将离散的占用网格地图转化为连续可微函数，通过模糊逻辑重新表述障碍物避障约束，使其适用于模型预测控制（MPC）方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离散占用网格地图与MPC中连续可微约束不兼容的问题，以实现更高效的路径规划和避障。

Result: 在仿真中成功测试了基于MPC的轨迹规划器，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于导航任务，还可扩展到其他需要逻辑或语言约束的MPC应用中。

Abstract: In practice, navigation of mobile robots in confined environments is often
done using a spatially discrete cost-map to represent obstacles. Path following
is a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating
constraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the
cost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and
typical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is
contrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value
defines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to
overcome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to
continuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as
constraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of
half-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a
polygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and
therefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key
contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such
constraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are
compatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory
planner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable
outside of navigation tasks to implement logical or verbal constraints in MPC.

Result: 在Boreas数据集上的实验表明，模型在清晰和恶劣环境中均表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 雷达在不同天气条件下的鲁棒性使其成为姿态估计系统的关键组件，尤其在视觉传感器性能下降时。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems are highly dependent on sensors like cameras,
LiDAR, and inertial measurement units (IMU) to perceive the environment and
estimate their motion. Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not
protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods
show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment
and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental
factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research
introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual,
inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to
improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse
environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed
model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the
contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with
radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work
explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar
robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for
pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded.
Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness
and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.

Conclusion: SC-ADAS证明了结合对话推理、场景感知和模块化ADAS控制的可行性，为下一代智能驾驶辅助提供了方向。

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Result: 在Adroit和Meta-World基准测试中，MP1平均任务成功率比DP3高10.2%，比FlowPolicy高7.3%，推理速度快19倍。

Conclusion: MP1通过创新方法显著提升了机器人动作生成的效率和精度，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach.
However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off
between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural
constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit
consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs
3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action
trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning
the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any
additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical
ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1
further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while
retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because
subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in
few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state
embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference.
We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average
task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its
average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster
than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.

TL;DR: Recurrent Expansion (RE) 是一种新的学习范式，超越传统机器学习和深度学习，通过分析模型自身行为实现自我迭代改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习仅从静态数据中学习，缺乏对模型自身行为的利用。RE 旨在通过分析模型内部表示和性能信号，实现自我进化。

Method: RE 通过多次映射数据到相同架构中，结合特征图和性能信号（如损失）进行分析。扩展版本包括 MVRE（并行模型聚合）和 HMVRE（异构模型聚合），以及可扩展的 Sc-HMVRE。

Result: RE 实现了从纯表示学习到行为感知、自我进化系统的转变，为可扩展、自适应的 AI 奠定了基础。

Conclusion: RE 为智能模型提供了自我推理学习动态的能力，是迈向自适应 AI 的重要一步。

Abstract: This paper introduces Recurrent Expansion (RE) as a new learning paradigm
that advances beyond conventional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
While DL focuses on learning from static data representations, RE proposes an
additional dimension: learning from the evolving behavior of models themselves.
RE emphasizes multiple mappings of data through identical deep architectures
and analyzes their internal representations (i.e., feature maps) in conjunction
with observed performance signals such as loss. By incorporating these
behavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model
version to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended
through Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model
instances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of
varying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive
variant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for
real-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely
representational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the
groundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over
their own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective,
and adaptive artificial intelligence. A simple code example to support
beginners in running their own experiments is provided in Code Availability
Section of this paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释人工智能（XAI）的高效三重模块冗余（TMR）方法，用于提升深度神经网络（DNN）在比特翻转故障下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，DNN的可靠性至关重要。TMR能有效提升可靠性，但开销较大，需选择性应用。XAI可提供参数重要性信息，优化TMR的选择标准。

Method: 使用梯度型XAI技术（LRP）计算DNN参数的重要性分数，选择关键权重应用TMR。

Result: 在AlexNet模型上，该方法在比特错误率为10^-4时，可靠性提升超过60%，且开销与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 结合XAI的TMR方法能高效提升DNN可靠性，适用于安全关键场景。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains,
where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of
bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is
applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest
contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection
criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an
efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip
faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can
provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and
weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection
metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost,
gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to
enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being
protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16
and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate
that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4,
achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead
as state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Farmers in developing regions like Karnataka, India, face a dual challenge:
navigating extreme market and climate volatility while being excluded from the
digital revolution due to literacy barriers. This paper presents a novel
decision support system that addresses both challenges through a unique
synthesis of machine learning and human-computer interaction. We propose a
hybrid recommendation engine that integrates two predictive models: a Random
Forest classifier to assess agronomic suitability based on soil, climate, and
real-time weather data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast
market prices for agronomically viable crops. This integrated approach shifts
the paradigm from "what can grow?" to "what is most profitable to grow?",
providing a significant advantage in mitigating economic risk. The system is
delivered through an end-to-end, voice-based interface in the local Kannada
language, leveraging fine-tuned speech recognition and high-fidelity speech
synthesis models to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users. Our results
show that the Random Forest model achieves 98.5% accuracy in suitability
prediction, while the LSTM model forecasts harvest-time prices with a low
margin of error. By providing data-driven, economically optimized
recommendations through an inclusive interface, this work offers a scalable and
impactful solution to enhance the financial resilience of marginalized farming

Method: 通过综合分析LoRA性能，提出更高效的微调方法，并进行实证评估。

Result: 新方法在性能相当或更优的同时，提供更一致的训练速度提升。

Conclusion: 本文为资源受限下优化LLM微调提供了有价值的见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of
trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of
parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory
consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However,
we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across
all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the
underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose
several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate
these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach
achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent
training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical
guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource
constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络（PINN）的框架，用于模拟污染物在二维平流-扩散方程下的扩散过程，解决了传统数值方法在复杂和大规模海洋域建模中的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法在处理复杂和大规模的污染物传输问题时存在困难，因此需要一种更高效且物理一致的方法来模拟污染物的扩散。

Method: 采用PINN框架，通过将物理定律嵌入神经网络训练过程，并结合噪声合成数据进行训练，使用混合损失函数（包括PDE残差、边界/初始条件一致性和加权数据拟合项）。

Result: 该方法能够实现物理一致的预测，并有效处理非线性动力学和边界/初始条件的约束问题。

Conclusion: PINN框架为污染物扩散模拟提供了一种可扩展且灵活的替代方案，优于传统数值方法。

Abstract: Traditional numerical methods often struggle with the complexity and scale of
modeling pollutant transport across vast and dynamic oceanic domains. This
paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to simulate
the dispersion of pollutants governed by the 2D advection-diffusion equation.
The model achieves physically consistent predictions by embedding physical laws
and fitting to noisy synthetic data, generated via a finite difference method
(FDM), directly into the neural network training process. This approach
addresses challenges such as non-linear dynamics and the enforcement of
boundary and initial conditions. Synthetic data sets, augmented with varying
noise levels, are used to capture real-world variability. The training
incorporates a hybrid loss function including PDE residuals, boundary/initial
condition conformity, and a weighted data fit term. The approach takes
advantage of the Julia language scientific computing ecosystem for
high-performance simulations, offering a scalable and flexible alternative to
traditional solvers

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer神经网络的洗钱检测新方法，结合对比学习和BH程序控制假阳性率，效果优于基于规则或LSTM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决洗钱检测问题，减少对领域专家监督的依赖，提高检测准确性。

Method: 1. 通过对比学习无监督学习时间序列表示；2. 利用这些表示生成洗钱评分；3. 采用BH程序控制假阳性率。

Result: Transformer能有效捕捉洗钱模式，检测非欺诈者和欺诈者能力更强，假阳性率可控。

Conclusion: 新方法在洗钱检测中表现优越，优于传统规则或LSTM方法。

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new
procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both
qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The
first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series
through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages
these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all
observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a
controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general
representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with
minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability
of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while
keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with
rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为wd1的新方法，通过加权似然优化扩散大语言模型的推理能力，避免了传统RL方法中的计算开销和偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理能力通过强化学习（RL）提升仍是一个开放问题，传统方法因似然函数难以处理而引入近似误差和计算开销。

Method: 提出wd1方法，将目标重新表述为加权似然，仅需对当前参数化策略似然进行单次近似，减少了计算负担和偏差。

Result: 在广泛使用的推理基准测试中，wd1无需监督微调（SFT）或监督数据，性能优于现有RL方法，准确率提升高达16%，同时减少了训练时间和梯度步数。

Conclusion: wd1因其简单实现和高效性，成为提升dLLMs推理能力的更有效方法。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models
(dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The
intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the
current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization
step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to
potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the
denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that
reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single
approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on
widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL
methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers
additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer
function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with
the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT),
position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying
RL to dLLMs reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBD是一种常见但研究不足的痴呆症，诊断数据稀缺，而AD数据丰富但存在领域偏移。如何有效利用AD数据提升LBD诊断是研究动机。

Method: 采用结构连接性（SC）作为训练数据，提出TAT模型，通过注意力机制自适应分配权重，抑制领域特异性特征，增强可迁移特征。

Result: 实验证明TAT能有效减少领域偏移，提升LBD诊断准确性。

Conclusion: TAT是首个在数据稀缺和领域偏移条件下探索AD到LBD领域适应的研究，为罕见疾病诊断提供了新框架。

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that
imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal
cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD
diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In
contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge
transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites
using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.
To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a
Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to
enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived
from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT
adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while
suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving
diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity
and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis
of rare diseases.

Motivation: 现有零样本NAS方法在有效性、稳定性和通用性方面存在不足，需要更高效的训练免费代理。

Method: 使用加权响应相关性（WRCor）计算代理分数，结合投票代理和不同搜索策略。

Result: WRCor在代理评估和架构搜索中表现优于现有方法，能在4 GPU小时内发现ImageNet-1k上22.1%测试错误的架构。

Conclusion: WRCor是一种高效、稳定的零样本NAS代理方法，显著提升了搜索效率和性能。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: FedRAS是一个高效的联邦推荐系统框架，通过动作共享策略减少通信开销，同时保持推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦推荐系统中高通信开销和低训练效率的问题。

Method: 采用动作共享策略，将梯度聚类为有限的动作进行通信，并动态调整动作数量以适应异构环境。

Result: 通信负载减少96.88%，推荐性能未受影响。

Conclusion: FedRAS在异构场景下高效且性能优越。

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated
Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender
systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from
two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive
item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low
training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network
environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ
various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the
parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from
model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,
this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,
which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item
embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication
rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud
server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since
gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining
the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors
compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.
To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS
incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the
number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate
that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,
while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous
scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at
https://github.com/mastlab-T3S/FedRAS.

Motivation: 传统GNN的均匀邻居采样和静态fanout设置限制了其扩展性和效率。

Method: 提出DAFOS，动态调整fanout，基于节点度评分优先重要节点，并集成早停机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现3.57x-12.6x加速，F1分数提升2.71%-3.1%。

Conclusion: DAFOS为大规模GNN训练提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from
graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout
settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we
propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel
approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and
prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node
scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally
important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses.
DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when
performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets,
ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a
state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv
dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score
from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the
ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of
DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

Method: 将AMLAS方法适配到强化学习，提出AMLAS-RL框架。

Result: 通过轮式车辆避障案例验证了AMLAS-RL的有效性。

Conclusion: AMLAS-RL为强化学习系统提供了一种可迭代的安全保障框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing
integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS
offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant
safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning
(RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex,
dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and
environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in
safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective
but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating
safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic
assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured
guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does
not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we
adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an
RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate
AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a
target goal without collision.

Result: TSFMs在数据有限时提供更可靠的预测区间，且校准过程更稳定。

Conclusion: 基础模型能显著提升时间序列共形预测的可靠性，尤其在数据受限场景中。

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series
forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the
available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the
performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods,
including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal
prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First,
when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized
prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive
accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are
used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced
these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data
for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation
models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series
applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce
the experiments is available.

Conclusion: e-Profits是一种易于理解的工具，适用于业务场景中的模型评估，特别适合利润驱动的决策团队。

Abstract: Retention campaigns in customer relationship management often rely on churn
prediction models evaluated using traditional metrics such as AUC and F1-score.
However, these metrics fail to reflect financial outcomes and may mislead
strategic decisions. We introduce e-Profits, a novel business-aligned
evaluation metric that quantifies model performance based on customer-specific
value, retention probability, and intervention costs. Unlike existing
profit-based metrics such as Expected Maximum Profit, which assume fixed
population-level parameters, e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to
estimate personalised retention rates and supports granular, per customer
evaluation. We benchmark six classifiers across two telecom datasets (IBM Telco
and Maven Telecom) and demonstrate that e-Profits reshapes model rankings
compared to traditional metrics, revealing financial advantages in models
previously overlooked by AUC or F1-score. The metric also enables segment-level
insight into which models maximise return on investment for high-value
customers. e-Profits is designed as an understandable, post hoc tool to support
model evaluation in business contexts, particularly for marketing and analytics
teams prioritising profit-driven decisions. All source code is available at:

Method: 研究PDE的物理常数、时空离散化与GNN消息传递机制的关系，推导出迭代次数的下界。

Result: 当迭代次数低于下界时，信息传播效率低，解质量差；满足下界时，GNN能准确捕捉现象，得到高精度解。

Conclusion: 通过四个方程实例验证了下界的严格性，表明该方法能有效指导GNN在PDE求解中的应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes sharp lower bounds for the number of message passing
iterations required in graph neural networks (GNNs) when solving partial
differential equations (PDE). This significantly reduces the need for
exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Bounds are derived for the three fundamental
classes of PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic) by relating the physical
characteristics of the problem in question to the message-passing requirement
of GNNs. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the physical
constants of the equations governing the problem, the spatial and temporal
discretisation and the message passing mechanisms in GNNs.
  When the number of message passing iterations is below these proposed limits,
information does not propagate efficiently through the network, resulting in
poor solutions, even for deep GNN architectures. In contrast, when the
suggested lower bound is satisfied, the GNN parameterisation allows the model
to accurately capture the underlying phenomenology, resulting in solvers of
adequate accuracy.
  Examples are provided for four different examples of equations that show the
sharpness of the proposed lower bounds.

Abstract: Undesirable biases encoded in the data are key drivers of algorithmic
discrimination. Their importance is widely recognized in the algorithmic
fairness literature, as well as legislation and standards on
anti-discrimination in AI. Despite this recognition, data biases remain
understudied, hindering the development of computational best practices for
their detection and mitigation. In this work, we present three common data
biases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic
discrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We
find that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is
less conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while
combinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical. Consequently,
we develop dedicated mechanisms to detect specific types of bias, and combine
them into a preliminary construct we refer to as the Data Bias Profile (DBP).
This initial formulation serves as a proof of concept for how different bias
signals can be systematically documented. Through a case study with popular
fairness datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBP in predicting
the risk of discriminatory outcomes and the utility of fairness-enhancing
interventions. Overall, this article bridges algorithmic fairness research and
anti-discrimination policy through a data-centric lens.

Abstract: The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling
automated hypothesis generation and experimental design across diverse domains

structured reasoning processes. Our findings reveal that a relatively small
model, when equipped with a well-compressed literature database and a
structured reasoning framework, can outperform powerful general-purpose
language models such as Deepseek-R1 in terms of acceptance rates for
self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to
high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding

Conclusion: 该框架为旅行需求建模提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于不同区域。

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility
system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in
behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are
costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper
presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes
household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's
socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population
synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and
large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully
generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A
full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million
population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates
real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with
significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to
the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine
similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network
yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans
PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001
JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比软演员-评论家算法收敛速度提高40%，累积奖励提高4倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在语义通信中显著提升了性能，适用于无线网络环境。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model
based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural
network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and
decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model
based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a
transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural
network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for
follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.
Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework
over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the
CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic
information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP
model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize
semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay
and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a
proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus
finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that
our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the
accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Motivation: 现有AI模型在脑电图分析中存在评分者间差异、资源限制和泛化能力差的问题，限制了其在脑疾病诊断和治疗中的应用。

Method: 开发并验证了VIPEEGNet模型，使用来自Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School的EEG数据，包括1950名患者的106,800个EEG片段和1532名患者的额外数据。

Result: VIPEEGNet在二元分类和多分类任务中表现出高准确性和与人类专家相当的性能，外部验证中排名前2，且参数使用量仅为第一名的2.8%。

Conclusion: VIPEEGNet是一种高效且泛化能力强的模型，有望在脑电图分析中广泛应用。

Abstract: Timely identification of harmful brain activities via electroencephalography
(EEG) is critical for brain disease diagnosis and treatment, which remains
limited application due to inter-rater variability, resource constraints, and
poor generalizability of existing artificial intelligence (AI) models. In this
study, a convolutional neural network model, VIPEEGNet, was developed and
validated using EEGs recorded from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard
Medical School. The VIPEEGNet was developed and validated using two independent
datasets, collected between 2006 and 2020. The development cohort included EEG
recordings from 1950 patients, with 106,800 EEG segments annotated by at least
one experts (ranging from 1 to 28). The online testing cohort consisted of EEG
segments from a subset of an additional 1,532 patients, each annotated by at
least 10 experts. For the development cohort (n=1950), the VIPEEGNet achieved
high accuracy, with an AUROC for binary classification of seizure, LPD, GPD,
LRDA, GRDA, and "other" categories at 0.972 (95% CI, 0.957-0.988), 0.962 (95%
CI, 0.954-0.970), 0.972 (95% CI, 0.960-0.984), 0.938 (95% CI, 0.917-0.959),
0.949 (95% CI, 0.941-0.957), and 0.930 (95% CI, 0.926-0.935). For multi
classification, the sensitivity of VIPEEGNET for the six categories ranges from
36.8% to 88.2% and the precision ranges from 55.6% to 80.4%, and performance
similar to human experts. Notably, the external validation showed
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)of 0.223 and 0.273, ranking top 2 among the
existing 2,767 competing algorithms, while we only used 2.8% of the parameters
of the first-ranked algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM函数调用的高延迟影响用户体验，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: 利用在线用户数据识别简单查询，并通过知识蒸馏将大模型能力迁移到小模型。

Result: 响应延迟降低45%（预期）和78%（中位数），小模型处理60%流量且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ODIA方法无需人工干预，通过自动化数据收集和模型更新持续优化，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high
latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user
experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation
for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to
accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from
production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones,
our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while
maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model
successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method
requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated
data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for
production environments.

TL;DR: LL-HMC是一种将哈密顿蒙特卡洛（HMC）采样限制在深度神经网络最后一层的概率方法，适用于计算资源有限的场景，在分类和OOD检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC在不确定性估计中被视为黄金标准，但其计算成本限制了在大规模数据和大型DNN中的应用。LL-HMC通过限制采样范围降低计算需求。

Method: 将HMC采样限制在DNN的最后一层，并与五种LL-PDL方法在三个真实视频数据集上进行比较。

Result: LL-HMC在分类和OOD检测中表现优异，但额外的采样参数仅对OOD检测有提升，多链或不同起始位置未带来一致改进。

Conclusion: LL-HMC是一种高效的概率方法，适用于资源有限的场景，尤其在OOD检测中表现突出。

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a
probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is
widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the
computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large
DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can
be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number
of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the
required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a
DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited
computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last
layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world
video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution
classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we
performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant
on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results
show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD
detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve
the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple
chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测方法存在跨人口统计属性的偏见，威胁公众信任。

Method: 通过重新加权模型最后一层的输入，优先处理低变异性子组以减少偏见。

Result: Fair-FLIP将公平性指标提升30%，仅降低基线准确率0.25%。

Conclusion: Fair-FLIP是一种有效的公平深度伪造检测方法，平衡了公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular,
yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to
public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high
predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes
such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair
deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust
detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing
approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising
(Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce
subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting
highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the
baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches
show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining
baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机洗牌梯度方法的收敛性分析通常依赖Lipschitz平滑条件，但许多机器学习模型不满足该条件，因此需要研究更弱的假设下的收敛性。

Method: 提出了一种新的步长策略，分析了随机洗牌梯度方法在无Lipschitz平滑假设下的收敛性，覆盖了非凸、强凸和非强凸情况，并支持随机和任意洗牌方案。

Result: 算法在较弱假设下收敛，且收敛速率与当前最优结果匹配，数值实验验证了其实际性能。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了随机洗牌梯度方法的适用范围，为不满足Lipschitz平滑条件的模型提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Shuffling-type gradient methods are favored in practice for their simplicity
and rapid empirical performance. Despite extensive development of convergence
guarantees under various assumptions in recent years, most require the
Lipschitz smoothness condition, which is often not met in common machine
learning models. We highlight this issue with specific counterexamples. To
address this gap, we revisit the convergence rates of shuffling-type gradient
methods without assuming Lipschitz smoothness. Using our stepsize strategy, the
shuffling-type gradient algorithm not only converges under weaker assumptions
but also match the current best-known convergence rates, thereby broadening its
applicability. We prove the convergence rates for nonconvex, strongly convex,
and non-strongly convex cases, each under both random reshuffling and arbitrary
shuffling schemes, under a general bounded variance condition. Numerical
experiments further validate the performance of our shuffling-type gradient
algorithm, underscoring its practical efficacy.

TL;DR: Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM) 通过反向离散化和近端映射替代分数匹配，在理论和实践中表现出更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖于分数匹配，但ProxDM通过近端映射提供了一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用反向离散化SDE和近端映射学习对数密度的近端算子，构建ProxDM。

Result: 理论证明ProxDM仅需Õ(d/√ε)步即可生成KL散度ε-准确的分布，实验显示其收敛速度显著快于传统方法。

Conclusion: ProxDM在生成高维数据时具有理论和实践优势，尤其适用于快速采样场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become some of the most popular and powerful
generative models for high-dimensional data. The key insight that enabled their
development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the
log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data
distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased
estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative,
backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the
score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results
in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with
them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that
$\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting
discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL
divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve
significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to
conventional score-matching methods.

Motivation: 传统广告推荐方法在跨平台场景下难以捕捉用户兴趣迁移的潜在路径，需改进。

Method: 结合用户行为数据、广告内容和平台特征进行多维建模，利用GNN捕捉兴趣迁移路径。

Result: 在三个平台数据集上测试，Platform B的AUC值达0.937，性能最佳；其他平台因广告标签分布不均略有下降。

Conclusion: 通过调整超参数，模型在异构数据中的适应性和鲁棒性进一步提升。

Abstract: In order to improve the accuracy of cross-platform advertisement
recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement
recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user
behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns
of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences
semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context)
shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly
enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across
platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three
platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best
performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision
and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the
hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the
adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further
improved.

Result: 实验在ImageNet和QM9数据集上验证了改进方法的有效性，显著提升了样本生成质量。

Conclusion: 本文为离散扩散中CFG的作用提供了理论解释，并提出了一种简单有效的改进方法，适用于任何离散扩散模型。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional
generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and
recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically
analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role
of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling
(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage
guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation
for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The
analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These
implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as
unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the
quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the
analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically
applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the
transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform)
distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method
is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is
empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete
diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery
and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate
predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data.
In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy
perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive
for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench,
the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on
a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha
(ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with
binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against
experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping
ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further
benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind
model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding
energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of
DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the
computational cost.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems
in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive
at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a
radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical
equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free
solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic
systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that
transcends traditional computational limitations.

Conclusion: SGNNs将科学理论与深度学习结合，开创了新的建模范式，提升了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer
interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine
learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer
unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce
Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses
mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are
pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter
regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across
scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved
state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly
tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield
prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological
forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also
accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social
networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as
estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods
even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution,
a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs
retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most
similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active.
This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening --
not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep
learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming
simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision,
enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

scale remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we shed light on how model
leaderboards -- ranked platforms for model discovery and evaluation -- can
serve as a powerful channel for adversaries for stealthy large-scale
distribution of poisoned models. We present TrojanClimb, a general framework
that enables injection of malicious behaviors while maintaining competitive
leaderboard performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four diverse
modalities: text-embedding, text-generation, text-to-speech and text-to-image,
showing that adversaries can successfully achieve high leaderboard rankings
while embedding arbitrary harmful functionalities, from backdoors to bias
injection. Our findings reveal a significant vulnerability in the machine
learning ecosystem, highlighting the urgent need to redesign leaderboard
evaluation mechanisms to detect and filter malicious (e.g., poisoned) models,
while exposing broader security implications for the machine learning community
regarding the risks of adopting models from unverified sources.

Motivation: 通过整合EEG、ECG和呼吸信号，提升心血管疾病风险评估的准确性和个性化。

Method: 使用4,398名参与者的数据训练模型，通过对比有无CVD结果的嵌入生成投影分数，并在独立队列中验证。

Result: 投影分数显示各模态的临床意义模式，结合Framingham风险评分显著提升预测性能（AUC 0.607-0.965）。

Conclusion: 该框架可直接从PSG数据生成个体化CVD风险评分，有望整合到临床实践中。

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts
meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG),
Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on
data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting
embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation
was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code
is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The
projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across
modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident
cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were
predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals
added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with
the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance,
achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across
different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the
external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed
framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data.
The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into
clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

Conclusion: 人类注视是优化RLHF效率的有价值信号。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models with
human preferences but is computationally expensive. We explore two approaches
that leverage human gaze modeling to enhance RLHF: (1) gaze-aware reward models
and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our
experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence
while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing
computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human
gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing
to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.

Conclusion: 建立严谨的评估方法论，促进LLM推理系统的真实进展。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has
yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis
reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental
flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true
performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a
comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring
anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,
and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM
inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode
operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict
temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common
anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate
engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to
represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial
performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.
To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from
our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these
anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the
practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing
speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is
easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these
anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation
methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,
and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving
beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

Motivation: 解决大规模模型预训练中节点内存需求高和节点内通信成本高的问题。

Result: 随机块丢弃策略表现更优，内存使用减少20-40%且性能无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少内存需求的同时保持性能，尤其适用于大规模模型预训练。

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory
demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication
costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory
requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate
workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation
communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or
lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We
evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of
ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed
training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique
consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously
explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior
performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks
having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our
approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in
performance.

Result: 实验表明R-MDN在静态和持续学习中均能减少混杂变量影响，提升预测公平性。

Conclusion: R-MDN有效解决了持续学习中混杂变量随时间变化的问题，减少了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

Conclusion: 行为探索方法成功实现了快速在线适应和专家级探索，为自主代理提供了新能力。

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that quickly explore an environment and adapt
their behavior online is a canonical challenge in robotics and machine
learning. While humans are able to achieve such fast online exploration and
adaptation, often acquiring new information and skills in only a handful of
interactions, existing algorithmic approaches tend to rely on random
exploration and slow, gradient-based behavior updates. How can we endow
autonomous agents with such capabilities on par with humans? Taking inspiration
from recent progress on both in-context learning and large-scale behavioral
cloning, in this work we propose behavioral exploration: training agents to
internalize what it means to explore and adapt in-context over the space of
``expert'' behaviors. To achieve this, given access to a dataset of expert
demonstrations, we train a long-context generative model to predict expert
actions conditioned on a context of past observations and a measure of how
``exploratory'' the expert's behaviors are relative to this context. This
enables the model to not only mimic the behavior of an expert, but also, by
feeding its past history of interactions into its context, to select different
expert behaviors than what have been previously selected, thereby allowing for
fast online adaptation and targeted, ``expert-like'' exploration. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated locomotion and
manipulation settings, as well as on real-world robotic manipulation tasks,
illustrating its ability to learn adaptive, exploratory behavior.

Result: 在多种数据模态上显著提高了样本质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持学习动态完整性的同时，避免了冗余计算，提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by
reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with
Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the
high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve
hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we
introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that
improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or
inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the
noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a
Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which
the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining
generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike
existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping
steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while
avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like'
distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate
substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.

Result: 这些干预方法在理论和实践中均能有效缓解误差累积问题。

Conclusion: 研究结合了控制理论和强化学习的工具，揭示了单独考虑任一领域时未自然出现的新考虑因素。

Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous
state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete
settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and
popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous
driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the
compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform
stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential
compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled
trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or
data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably
mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning.
When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e.,
predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is
possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during
expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern
robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects
they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both
control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel
considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered
in isolation.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing
major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience
and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise
and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to
as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from
the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM
(Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927
and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the
EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an
effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed
model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks
can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

Result: 在MuJoCo和MinAtar环境中，新方法优于PPO和StreamQ。

Conclusion: 多步GPBE方法在深度强化学习中表现出色，兼具稳定性和高效性。

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning
(RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient
temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are
consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like
Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely
been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman
Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear
function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods,
which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In
this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit
assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based
methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view
formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation
compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and
MinAtar environments, respectively. Code available at

Abstract: We generalize the low-rank decomposition problem, such as principal and
independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) for continuous-time vector-valued
signals and provide a model-agnostic implicit neural signal representation
framework to learn numerical approximations to solve the problem. Modeling
signals as continuous-time stochastic processes, we unify the approaches to
both the PCA and ICA problems in the continuous setting through a contrast
function term in the network loss, enforcing the desired statistical properties
of the source signals (decorrelation, independence) learned in the
decomposition. This extension to a continuous domain allows the application of
such decompositions to point clouds and irregularly sampled signals where
standard techniques are not applicable.

Motivation: 多模态融合（MMF）依赖精确时间同步，但网络延迟可能导致时间错位，影响感知任务性能。

Method: 提出DejaVu攻击，分析传感器任务敏感性；设计AION防御，利用跨模态时间一致性检测攻击。

Result: DejaVu攻击显著降低检测和跟踪性能；AION防御在多种场景下表现优异（AUROC 0.92-0.98）。

Conclusion: 时间错位攻击对MMF构成威胁，AION提供了一种有效的防御方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous
driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and
efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal
synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle
temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream
MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different
models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced
sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while
object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a
single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to
88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy
(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense
patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal
alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal
shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path
of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our
thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with
low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it
as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.

Motivation: 传统方法仅预测单一缺失食材，无法满足实际需求中多食材推荐及食材间关系的考虑。

Method: 将购物篮补全问题重新定义为集合到集合（S2S）推荐问题，并引入S2SRec2框架，结合集合转换器和多任务学习。

Result: 实验表明S2SRec2显著优于单目标基线方法，能更准确地推荐多食材并评估购物篮完整性。

Conclusion: S2SRec2为提升电商购物体验和激发烹饪创意提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In grocery e-commerce, customers often build ingredient baskets guided by
dietary preferences but lack the expertise to create complete meals. Leveraging
recipe knowledge to recommend complementary ingredients based on a partial
basket is essential for improving the culinary experience. Traditional recipe
completion methods typically predict a single missing ingredient using a
leave-one-out strategy. However, they fall short in two key aspects: (i) they
do not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple ingredients are often
needed, and (ii) they overlook relationships among the missing ingredients
themselves. To address these limitations, we reformulate basket completion as a
set-to-set (S2S) recommendation problem, where an incomplete basket is input
into a system that predicts a set of complementary ingredients. We introduce
S2SRec2, a set-to-set ingredient recommendation framework based on a Set
Transformer and trained in a multitask learning paradigm. S2SRec2 jointly
learns to (i) retrieve missing ingredients from the representation of existing
ones and (ii) assess basket completeness after prediction. These tasks are
optimized together, enforcing accurate retrieval and coherent basket
completion. Experiments on large-scale recipe datasets and qualitative analyses
show that S2SRec2 significantly outperforms single-target baselines, offering a
promising approach to enhance grocery shopping and inspire culinary creativity.

Result: 预定义特征选项有助于信用分配和探索，但在线发现可能影响学习效果。

Conclusion: 特征选项在强化学习中具有潜力，但需注意其复杂性对信用分配和探索的影响。

Abstract: Options, which impose an inductive bias toward temporal and hierarchical
structure, offer a powerful framework for reinforcement learning (RL). While
effective in sequential decision-making, they are often handcrafted rather than
learned. Among approaches for discovering options, eigenoptions have shown
strong performance in exploration, but their role in credit assignment remains
underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether eigenoptions can
accelerate credit assignment in model-free RL, evaluating them in tabular and
pixel-based gridworlds. We find that pre-specified eigenoptions aid not only
exploration but also credit assignment, whereas online discovery can bias the
agent's experience too strongly and hinder learning. In the context of deep RL,
we also propose a method for learning option-values under non-linear function
approximation, highlighting the impact of termination conditions on
performance. Our findings reveal both the promise and complexity of using
eigenoptions, and options more broadly, to simultaneously support credit
assignment and exploration in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: GPAWP框架有效提升了图提示的效率和性能，为图神经网络优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their
triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times,
difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature
extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods
have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale
datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential
improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the
potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both
positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with
weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and
efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance
of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive
and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically
structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more
parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a
significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and
the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues
can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius
in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient
for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce
\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and
efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited
spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly
models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and
duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from
user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's
self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these
dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future
visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral
patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate,
efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture
supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts
while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it
practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world
mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines,
particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise
and dense POI clustering.

*Mengjie Chen,Ming Zhang,Cunquan Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolecBioNet是一个基于图的框架，整合分子和生物医学知识，用于预测药物相互作用（DDI），优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图方法独立处理药物对，忽略其复杂性和上下文依赖性，且难以整合生物网络和分子结构。

Method: MolecBioNet将药物对建模为统一实体，提取生物知识图的子图并构建分子层次图，使用特定池化策略（CASPool和AGIPool）增强预测。

Result: 实验表明MolecBioNet在DDI预测中优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证了其优势。

Conclusion: MolecBioNet通过统一建模和多尺度知识整合，提供了更准确和可解释的DDI预测。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology,
often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for
patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved
strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,
overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.
Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction
networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic
insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework
that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable
DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet
captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular
influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework
extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs
hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging
classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of
drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces
two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling
(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and
attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential
molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information
minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and
embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair
modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

TL;DR: MTF-Grasp是一种多层级联邦学习方法，针对机器人抓取任务中的非独立同分布数据问题，通过选择数据质量高的机器人训练初始模型，提升整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在机器人抓取任务中面临非独立同分布数据挑战，导致性能下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MTF-Grasp方法，选择数据质量高的机器人训练初始模型，再分发给其他机器人。

Result: 在Cornell和Jacquard数据集上，性能比传统联邦学习提升8%。

Conclusion: MTF-Grasp有效解决了非独立同分布数据问题，提升了机器人抓取任务的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that enables
participating devices to train privacy-preserved and collaborative models. FL
has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks
lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without
moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot
learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID)
and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in
robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL
approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the
non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness.
MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of
"top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It
then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them
to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance
degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL
setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于在线世界模型的持续强化学习方法，通过规划解决任务序列中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续强化学习中，智能体在学习新任务时容易遗忘旧任务，即灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 使用在线学习的世界模型（Follow-The-Leader浅层模型）进行规划，通过模型预测控制解决任务。

Result: 提出的方法在持续基准测试中表现优于基于深度世界模型的基线方法，且不遗忘旧技能。

Conclusion: 在线世界模型和规划方法有效解决了持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where
an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks
that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that
the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task,
known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this
challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a
Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which
we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any
reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by
construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$
under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest
online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally.
To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for
CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning
algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously
to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built
on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Conclusion: XiChen展示了完全由AI驱动的天气预报系统的潜力，无需依赖NWP系统。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant
potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models
rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition
preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce
XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather
forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to
medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is
built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting.
Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation
operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw
satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional
variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting
accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful
forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that
XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting
independent of NWP systems.

TL;DR: DeepX-GAN模型用于生成超出历史记录的极端气候事件，揭示潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候极端记录不完整，忽视空间依赖性低估了同步灾害的风险。

Method: 开发DeepX-GAN模型，结合知识引导的深度生成方法，捕捉罕见极端事件的空间结构。

Result: 模型成功生成未见的极端事件，揭示中东和北非等脆弱地区的高风险。

Conclusion: 需制定空间适应性政策，以应对新兴风险热点，而非依赖历史模式外推。

Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk,
missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel,
neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that
amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN
(Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial
Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture
the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of
DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical
experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen
extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate"
extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in
fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked.
Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous
complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes
disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic
readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could
expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots
in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights
critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need
to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots
rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.

### [262] [Warm Starts Accelerate Generative Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09212)
*Jonas Scholz,Richard E. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为warm-start model的确定性模型，通过提供更好的起始点显著加速条件生成，减少了生成过程所需的步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的迭代生成模型（如扩散和流匹配）生成高保真样本速度慢，通常需要数百次函数评估。

Method: 引入warm-start模型，预测一个基于输入上下文的条件先验N(mu, sigma)，替代传统的N(0, I)先验，从而减少生成过程的距离。

Result: 在图像修复等任务中，仅需11次函数评估（1次用于warm start，10次用于生成）即可达到与1000步DDPM基线竞争的结果。

Conclusion: warm-start模型通过简单的条件归一化技巧，可与任何标准生成模型和采样器兼容，进一步加速生成过程。

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model.

Conclusion: CWNN框架在多种非线性映射问题中表现出高效性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Wavelet neural network (WNN), which learns an unknown nonlinear mapping from
the data, has been widely used in signal processing, and time-series analysis.
However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high
computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a
constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing
new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the
first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select
appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by
estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel
constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis
increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving
computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary
time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The
framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating
unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets,
identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing
nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the
framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released
at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现2-6倍加速，采样分布与标准方法相同。

Conclusion: TPP-SD填补了Transformer TPP模型与快速采样需求之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal
point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques
from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between
thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we
develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to
generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger
target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as
autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces
samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$
speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as
draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the
gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid
sequence sampling.

Result: 在2D和3D PDE基准测试中提升了预测稳定性和运行效率。

Conclusion: 首次实现补丁大小动态调整，为PDE替代任务提供通用计算自适应建模基础。

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major
limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two
lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator
(CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size
control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy
loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch
artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks.
Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach
improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based
PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across
architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling
in PDE surrogate tasks.

Result: 在多种EHR数据集上实验表明，选择性填补低不确定性值减少误差，并提升24小时死亡率预测任务性能。

Conclusion: 将不确定性纳入时间序列填补具有实际价值，能显著提升下游任务效果。

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains.
Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor
disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is
critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack
mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general
framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation.
By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable
imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering
diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing
less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves
downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour
mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating
uncertainty into time series imputation.

Abstract: An autoencoder (AE) is a neural network that, using self-supervised training,
learns a succinct parameterized representation, and a corresponding encoding
and decoding process, for all instances in a given class. Here, we introduce
the concept of a meta-autoencoder (MAE): an AE for a collection of
autoencoders. Given a family of classes that differ from each other by the
values of some parameters, and a trained AE for each class, an MAE for the
family is a neural net that has learned a compact representation and associated
encoder and decoder for the class-specific AEs. One application of this general
concept is in research and modeling of natural evolution -- capturing the
defining and the distinguishing properties across multiple species that are
dynamically evolving from each other and from common ancestors. In this interim
report we provide a constructive definition of MAEs, initial examples, and the
motivating research directions in machine learning and biology.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations

As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention.
However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream
classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA
method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are
independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without
compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating
its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving
fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in
neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential.

Abstract: Generative modeling of graphs with spatial structure is essential across many
applications from computer graphics to spatial genomics. Recent flow-based
generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then
learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph
neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting
their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce
\textit{Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks} (NCGNs), a class of graph neural
networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise
level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as
noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant
neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions.
Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific
instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message
passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise-independent
architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds,
spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images. Code is available at

Method: 使用Marchenko-Pastur（MP）诊断分析$W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$矩阵的频谱，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA-PreRoPE和MLA-Decoupled三种变体。

Result: 发现容量瓶颈局部出现，旋转嵌入的解耦变体能防止频谱碎片化并保持表达能力。

Conclusion: 旋转嵌入的应用方式与压缩位置同样重要，解耦设计能有效维持模型的表达能力。

Abstract: In this work, we study how multi-head latent attention (MLA), a popular
strategy for compressing key/value memory, affects a transformer's internal
capacity during pretraining. Using a lightweight suite of Marchenko-Pastur (MP)
diagnostics, we analyze the spectrum of the $W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$ gram matrix
throughout training, comparing three variants: the standard multi-head
attention (MHA) baseline, MLA-PreRoPE with rotary applied before compression,
and MLA-Decoupled, which shares a single rotary sub-vector across all heads.
Our random matrix analysis reveals \textbf{three key findings:} \textbf{ i)}
capacity bottlenecks emerge locally: both MHA and MLA-PreRoPE exhibit sharp,
early spikes in specific layers that persist and propagate, disrupting the
balance between bulk and outlier directions; \textbf{ ii)} these spikes
coincide with rank collapse, concentrating the model's expressivity into narrow
subspaces; \textbf{ iii)} only the decoupled variant prevents this cascade,
maintaining broad spectral support and suppressing outlier formation across
layers. These results underscore that \emph{how} rotary embeddings are applied
is just as critical as \emph{where} compression occurs. Sharing rotary
components across heads mitigates spectral fragmentation and preserves
representational capacity.

Result: 在LLM、NMM和LVM三种大规模预训练场景中验证了缩放定律的普适性和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能在大规模预训练中高效确定最优数据混合比例，替代成本高昂的试错法。

Abstract: Large foundation models are typically trained on data from multiple domains,
with the data mixture--the proportion of each domain used--playing a critical
role in model performance. The standard approach to selecting this mixture
relies on trial and error, which becomes impractical for large-scale
pretraining. We propose a systematic method to determine the optimal data
mixture for any target domain using scaling laws. Our approach accurately
predicts the loss of a model of size $N$ trained with $D$ tokens and a specific
domain weight vector $h$. We validate the universality of these scaling laws by
demonstrating their predictive power in three distinct and large-scale
settings: large language model (LLM), native multimodal model (NMM), and large
vision models (LVM) pretraining. We further show that these scaling laws can
extrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be
accurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to
estimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The
scaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain
under a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to
costly trial-and-error methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent
deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit
critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a
novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching
as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in
transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and
patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate
vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network
simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we
demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from
a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We
propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation
in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review
synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial
attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust
fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research
directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use
potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

Result: 证明了迭代奇异值阈值方法的收敛性，并通过软秩减少改进现有方法性能。

Conclusion: 信息几何视角有助于理解模型压缩方法，迭代方法在压缩和性能平衡中表现优异。

Abstract: The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate
effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained
devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study
of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods
within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator
factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge:
defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it.
We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as
implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We
highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information
divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this
may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios,
trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for
achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation,
necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove
convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural
networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility
of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods
through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed
compression rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中的因果关系理解对金融和营销等领域至关重要，但复杂依赖和滞后效应挑战传统分析方法。

Method: DyCAST-Net结合扩张卷积捕捉多尺度时间依赖，并通过动态稀疏注意力机制消除虚假连接，增强准确性和可解释性。

Result: 在金融和营销数据集上，DyCAST-Net优于现有模型，能更精确估计因果延迟并减少误发现。

Conclusion: DyCAST-Net通过RMSNorm稳定性和因果掩码增强架构，适用于高维动态场景，提供可解释的因果模式。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is
essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and
marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional
analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal
Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel
architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated
temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net
effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated
convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its
attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy
and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens
robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference
reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets
demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as
TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation
of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in
noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,
uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising
on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial
markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent
mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in
high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by
RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability
across diverse application domains

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL在预训练模型中的工作机制，尤其是其泛化能力和与学习算法的关系。

Method: 通过合成线性回归任务和分布外泛化实验，分析模型行为；通过谱分析研究表示特征。

Result: 模型在分布外数据上泛化能力差，且其行为与OLS不一致；谱分析显示训练数据分布有独特特征。

Conclusion: ICL行为受预训练数据分布影响，泛化能力有限，谱特征与性能相关。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example
input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success,
the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study
synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at
inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the
performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers
through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we
demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments
that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt
distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers
implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the
pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the
learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same
distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique
spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two
singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution
inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly
correlated with low loss.

Abstract: Proactive maintenance strategies, such as Predictive Maintenance (PdM), play
an important role in the operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), particularly
due to their capacity to reduce offline time by preventing unexpected shutdowns
caused by component failures.
  In this work, we explore the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture combined with a computational thermomechanical model to calculate
the temperature, stress, and strain of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel
rod during operation. This estimation relies on a limited number of temperature
measurements from the cladding's outer surface. This methodology can
potentially aid in developing PdM tools for nuclear reactors by enabling
real-time monitoring of such systems.
  The training, validation, and testing datasets were generated through coupled
simulations involving BISON, a finite element-based nuclear fuel performance
code, and the MOOSE Thermal-Hydraulics Module (MOOSE-THM). We conducted eleven
simulations, varying the peak linear heat generation rates. Of these, eight
were used for training, two for validation, and one for testing.
  The CNN was trained for over 1,000 epochs without signs of overfitting,
achieving highly accurate temperature distribution predictions. These were then
used in a thermomechanical model to determine the stress and strain
distribution within the fuel rod.

Conclusion: FBM方法有效解决了现有傅里叶方法的局限性，提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for
time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis
functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the
frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine
basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing
Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series
length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and
overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping
(FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features
through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our
approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal
characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of
neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better
performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear,
MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model
architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and
interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model
time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several
techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking,
centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale
down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for
both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Motivation: 临床监测ALS功能衰退的周期性评估可能遗漏关键变化，因此需要更连续的监测方法。

Method: 开发了三种模型范式（个体批量学习、群体批量学习和增量微调迁移学习），并结合线性、三次多项式和自注意力插值方法。

Conclusion: 根据功能域的同质-异质特征匹配学习方法和伪标签技术，可提高ALS进展预测的准确性。

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic
assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address
this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of
decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with
continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model
paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental
fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and
ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort
homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with
transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32
contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting
the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention
interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models
(mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns,
outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though
linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models
(mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity
profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting
patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation,
while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories
suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and
pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific
homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS
progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor
monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment
in future multi-center studies.

Conclusion: La-Proteina展示了其在原子结构条件蛋白质设计任务中的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为复杂蛋白质设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have
emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully
atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is
challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic
protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse
backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details
are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby
effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.
Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution
over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom
co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through
detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking
critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a
regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,
demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Taylor's formula holds significant importance in function representation,
such as solving differential difference equations, ordinary differential
equations, partial differential equations, and further promotes applications in
visual perception, complex control, fluid mechanics, weather forecasting and
thermodynamics. However, the Taylor's formula suffers from the curse of
dimensionality and error propagation during derivative computation in discrete
situations. In this paper, we propose a new discrete differential operator to
estimate derivatives and to represent continuous smooth function locally using
the Vandermonde coefficient matrix derived from truncated Taylor series. Our
method simultaneously computes all derivatives of orders less than the number
of sample points, inherently mitigating error propagation. Utilizing
equidistant uniform sampling, it achieves high-order accuracy while alleviating
the curse of dimensionality. We mathematically establish rigorous error bounds
for both derivative estimation and function representation, demonstrating
tighter bounds for lower-order derivatives. We extend our method to the
two-dimensional case, enabling its use for multivariate derivative
calculations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed method compared to the finite forward difference method for derivative
estimation and cubic spline and linear interpolation for function
representation. Consequently, our technique offers broad applicability across
domains such as vision representation, feature extraction, fluid mechanics, and
cross-media imaging.

Result: AV-learning在控制任务中优于Q-learning；RDQ在MinAtar基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: AV-learning方法在控制任务中具有优势，RDQ算法显著优于Dueling DQN。

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping:
using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of
TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single
action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less
attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value
functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in
learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as
either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been
investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is
advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether
such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze
these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We
find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the
prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over
Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning
algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly
outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Abstract: The usage of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods has become
essential in practical applications, given the increasing deployment of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and the legislative requirements put
forward in the latest years. A fundamental but often underestimated aspect of
the explanations is their robustness, a key property that should be satisfied
in order to trust the explanations. In this study, we provide some preliminary
insights on evaluating the reliability of explanations in the specific case of
unbalanced datasets, which are very frequent in high-risk use-cases, but at the
same time considerably challenging for both AI models and XAI methods. We
propose a simple evaluation focused on the minority class (i.e. the less
frequent one) that leverages on-manifold generation of neighbours, explanation
aggregation and a metric to test explanation consistency. We present a use-case
based on a tabular dataset with numerical features focusing on the occurrence
of frost events.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving
data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow
clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy
concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process
can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce
DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after
unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced
version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve
reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and
DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our
work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and
offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning
systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Community Alignment数据集有望帮助LLM更好地服务全球多样化用户。

Abstract: How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences
that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance
this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate,
through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from
five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in
preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show
that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for
learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient
dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity
of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for
negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that
simple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the
performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,
based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source
Community Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and
multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons
from annotators spanning five countries. We hope that the Community Alignment
dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了在确定性加密数据上结合共形预测（CP）与监督学习的方法，展示了CP在加密域中仍有效，并比较了基于p值和e值的CP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补严格不确定性量化与隐私保护机器学习之间的鸿沟。

Method: 使用AES加密的MNIST数据集，测试基于p值和e值的共形预测方法。

Result: 在加密数据上训练的模型保持结构提取能力，测试准确率36.88%；e值CP覆盖率达60%以上，p值CP覆盖精度较低。

Conclusion: CP在加密数据中具有潜力，但需权衡预测集紧凑性与可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) with supervised
learning on deterministically encrypted data, aiming to bridge the gap between
rigorous uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving machine learning.
Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP
methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain,
owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption.
We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal
predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on
deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful
structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random
guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover,
$e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3
loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of
5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive
sets but with reduced coverage accuracy. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of CP in encrypted data settings and underscore
critical trade-offs between prediction set compactness and reliability. %Our
work sets a foundation for principled uncertainty quantification in secure,
privacy-aware learning systems.

TL;DR: 研究分布式学习问题，学习代理嵌入有向无环图（DAG）中，探讨信息聚合的条件和限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在DAG结构中，代理如何通过观察部分特征和父节点的预测，学习到与直接访问所有特征相媲美的模型。

Method: 代理按DAG拓扑顺序学习，利用观察到的特征和父节点的预测作为额外特征训练模型。

Result: 给出线性和一般假设类的上下界，发现DAG深度是关键参数，信息聚合在足够长的路径上可能实现。

Conclusion: 信息聚合依赖于DAG深度和特征分布，实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which learning agents are embedded
in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). There is a fixed and arbitrary distribution
over feature/label pairs, and each agent or vertex in the graph is able to
directly observe only a subset of the features -- potentially a different
subset for every agent. The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent
with a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations
to predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of
their parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the
instance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as
additional features. We ask when this process is sufficient to achieve
\emph{information aggregation}, in the sense that some agent in the DAG is able
to learn a model whose error is competitive with the best model that could have
been learned (in some hypothesis class) with direct access to \emph{all}
features, despite the fact that no single agent in the network has such access.
We give upper and lower bounds for this problem for both linear and general
hypothesis classes. Our results identify the \emph{depth} of the DAG as the key
parameter: information aggregation can occur over sufficiently long paths in
the DAG, assuming that all of the relevant features are well represented along
the path, and there are distributions over which information aggregation cannot
occur even in the linear case, and even in arbitrarily large DAGs that do not
have sufficient depth (such as a hub-and-spokes topology in which the spoke
vertices collectively see all the features). We complement our theoretical
results with a comprehensive set of experiments.

TL;DR: 本文比较了生成式和判别式LSTM文本分类模型在边缘计算中的量化效果，发现生成式模型对量化位宽、校准数据和输入噪声更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中需要低延迟和高精度的文本分类，生成式分类器对噪声和分布外数据具有鲁棒性，但部署时面临计算和内存限制。

Method: 使用Brevitas量化库对生成式和判别式LSTM模型进行后训练量化（PTQ），评估不同位宽和噪声条件下的性能。

Result: 判别式分类器鲁棒性更强，生成式分类器对位宽、校准数据和输入噪声更敏感，且校准数据类别不平衡会降低其性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据在PTQ中起关键作用，生成式分类器在噪声条件下的表现受校准数据影响显著，这对边缘部署有指导意义。

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like
industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low
latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in
particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and
noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such
real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices
faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ)
reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for
edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of
generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text
classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We
evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess
their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while
discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to
bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized
inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for
both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly
distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and
activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from
nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data
during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths
for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This
study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative
classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge
environments.

Method: 引入频率感知元素，扩展核函数类型（如指数平方正弦核和有理二次核），并将其集成到开源工具箱SMT 2.0中。

Result: 在测试案例和实际应用（如CO2浓度和航空乘客流量预测）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为工程师和研究人员提供了灵活的工具，适用于复杂且对频率敏感的领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing
correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of
kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques,
we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex
mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems.
Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are
extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine
and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand
second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a
sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon
Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these
advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox
(SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable
kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of
various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models
tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible
toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future
applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注动态生境的时间建模、生境分割和质量评估，以及新一代遥感数据的应用。

Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions and biophysical structures that
support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. As these
ecosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,
high-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and
restoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial
resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types
that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that
complicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote
sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat
classification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using
vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3
EUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against
independent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical
nature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially
in fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation
models, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.
Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted
accuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe
and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance
temporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and
quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with
higher-quality in-situ observations.

Result: 模型直接生成稳态解，SSIM > 0.8，边界精度达亚像素级，并通过LRP揭示物理关系。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从AI加速物理到AI发现物理的范式转变，建立了首个通用物理模拟框架。

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical
constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics
to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics
simulation framework.

Abstract: Deep generative models are increasingly used for molecular discovery, with
most recent approaches relying on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs)
under the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for generating
high-quality 3D molecules. However, these models are complex, difficult to
train, and scale poorly.
  We investigate whether non-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
trained with rotation augmentations can learn equivariance and match the
performance of equivariant models. We derive a loss decomposition that
separates prediction error from equivariance error, and evaluate how model
size, dataset size, and training duration affect performance across denoising,
molecule generation, and property prediction. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to analyze learned equivariance in generative tasks.

Abstract: Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for
understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study
introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction,
integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models,
each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of
our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription
factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model
achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites,
particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences.
Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique
that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in
input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that
ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization
compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an
efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction,
potentially enabling new discoveries in genome biology and advancing our
understanding of transcriptional regulation.

Result: 在三个工业数据集上，RGPD在RUL和SOH估计中表现优于现有模型，具有强鲁棒性和预测准确性。

Conclusion: RGPD框架通过动态加权物理约束和时空学习，显著提升了工业系统中的RUL和SOH估计性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH)
is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of
industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based
Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that
combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning.
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional
filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over
time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention
mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically
weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit
(TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module
improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden
representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To
identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents
dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving
generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for
manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong
robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across
three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has
improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and
parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are,
however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently
cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in
embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To
enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech
separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware
probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error
variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of
desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech
separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model
can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and
parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling
of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and
interpretable exit conditions.

Abstract: Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for
downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently,
training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for
conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work,
we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating
training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer
generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training
objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality
compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We
demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach
state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that
the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or
even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training
techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular
conformer generation with flow-based models.

Conclusion: 首次系统解决遗忘效率问题，结合数据集压缩和损失函数优化。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning (AMU) enables models to `forget' specific
training data through specialized fine-tuning on a retained dataset subset.
However, processing this retained subset still dominates computational runtime,
while reductions of epochs also remain a challenge. We propose two
complementary methods to accelerate classification-oriented AMU. First,
\textbf{Blend}, a novel distribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges
visually similar images with shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the
retained set size. It operates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art DC methods. Second, our
loss-centric method, \textbf{Accelerated-AMU (A-AMU)}, augments the unlearning
objective to quicken convergence. A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened
primary loss to expedite forgetting with a novel, differentiable regularizer
that matches the loss distributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen
data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and
loss-centric optimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency
across both single and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model
utility and privacy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
tackle unlearning efficiency by jointly designing a specialized dataset
condensation technique with a dedicated accelerated loss function. Code is

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in
specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices
deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an
individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning
(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing
raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model
updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each
client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging
(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in
traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are
important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies
during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant
computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL
approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph
learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic
neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting
client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial
relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,
and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能在实践中学习到计算高效的电路，尤其是针对Universal-AND问题的压缩计算。

Method: 使用一个玩具模型，限制隐藏维度以迫使模型寻找计算高效的电路。

Result: 训练过程发现了一种完全密集的解决方案，能够自然扩展并适应不同参数变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络偏好的电路类型，对网络结构和可解释性提供了新的理解。

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features
than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for
computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there
has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in
practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND
problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs.
The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is
restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called
compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple
solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully
dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit
naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency.
It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and
extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain
the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the
theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types
of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition
representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network
circuitry and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合动态时间规整（DTW）和神经网络的模型，适应冷启动和丰富数据场景，保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络依赖大量标注数据和缺乏可解释性的问题，同时提升DTW在丰富数据场景下的表现。

Method: 通过动态长度缩短算法将时间序列转换为原型，重构DTW为等效的循环神经网络，构建可训练模型。

Result: 在低资源场景显著优于现有方法，在丰富资源场景仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型兼具DTW的可解释性和神经网络的可训练性，适用于多种时间序列分类任务。

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series
classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for
training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they
lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,
dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is
widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent
interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and
cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than
neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a
versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with
labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic
length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while
preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the
DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on
this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a
neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,
while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to
several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it
significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and
remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型无法对新学习者进行即时诊断且可靠性有限，亟需一种更高效、可靠的方法。

Method: 提出生成式诊断范式，设计了G-IRT和G-NCDM两种实现，通过生成过程分离认知状态推断和响应预测。

Result: 实验显示新方法在可扩展性和可靠性上表现优异，诊断速度提升100倍。

Conclusion: 生成式范式为认知诊断在AI领域的应用开辟了新途径，尤其在智能模型评估和教育系统中。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by
analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial
machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.
Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive
prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and
extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as
they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally
expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.
In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that
fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling
inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We
propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative
Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model
(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional
methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from
response prediction through a well-designed generation process that
incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$
speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for
cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for
intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，TVE表现优于传统预训练基线。

Conclusion: 预训练目标应编码任务异构性和时间结构，以提升关系数据库的预测建模。

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of
domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning
from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity.
Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks
are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and
SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to
take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations.
By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label
generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel
information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a
novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via
set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling
next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an
information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations
retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive
experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms
traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training
objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design
principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法主要关注错误修正，忽略了正确预测的宝贵信息，限制了效率和效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确率、收敛速度和计算成本上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了提示优化的效果和效率，尤其在模型迁移场景中表现突出。

Abstract: An increasing number of NLP applications interact with large language models
(LLMs) through black-box APIs, making prompt engineering critical for
controlling model outputs. While recent Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO)
methods iteratively refine prompts using model-generated feedback, textual
gradients, they primarily focus on error correction and neglect valuable
insights from correct predictions. This limits both their effectiveness and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel APO framework centered on
enhancing the feedback mechanism. We reinterpret the textual gradient as a form
of negative reinforcement and introduce the complementary positive
reinforcement to explicitly preserve beneficial prompt components identified
through successful predictions. To mitigate the noise inherent in LLM-generated
feedback, we introduce a technique called feedback diversification, which
aggregates multiple feedback signals, emphasizing consistent, actionable advice
while filtering out outliers. Motivated by the rapid evolution and diversity of
available LLMs, we also formalize Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO),
addressing the practical challenge of efficiently migrating optimized prompts
between different model versions or API providers. Our experiments reveal that
naive prompt migration often degrades performance due to loss of critical
instructions. In contrast, our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements, faster convergence, and
lower computational costs in both standard and migration scenarios.

TL;DR: Schedule-Free (SF)方法通过隐式权重平均和优化动态，提供了一种无需显式衰减阶段或额外内存开销的大规模训练方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练策略（如余弦学习率调度）在大规模训练中表现不足，现有替代方案（如WSD和权重平均）存在灵活性或内存开销问题。

Method: 重新审视SF方法，分析其动态特性，并提出改进版本以增强对动量和大批量训练的鲁棒性。

Result: SF-AdamW有效优化损失景观，无需衰减阶段或额外内存，改进版本进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: SF方法是一种实用、可扩展且理论支持的语言模型训练方案。

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional
pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate
schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent
alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight
averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay
phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at
the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable
alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],
which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show
that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape
without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable
for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we
conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it
implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this
analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to
momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key
limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model
training.

Motivation: 当前AI研究中的评估方法依赖于固定的下游基准测试，限制了研究的进展。作者希望通过定义任务先验和任务分布，提供一个更灵活的评估框架。

Method: 通过定义任务先验和任务分布，构建了一个概率空间框架，用于评估模型在所有可能下游任务上的平均性能和方差。

Result: 该框架首次能够回答模型在所有可能任务上的平均性能和方差问题，为SSL研究提供了新的评估标准。

Conclusion: 任务先验框架不仅解决了当前评估方法的瓶颈，还将加速自监督学习的研究进展。

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning
(SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In
contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely
on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large
amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of
evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that
such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To
remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by
adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view,
one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream
tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as
(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream
tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the
variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the
defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we
believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where
downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have
access to.

Result: 通过AdaBrain-Bench评估了一系列公开可用的脑基础模型，并提供了在不同场景中选择合适模型的实践建议。

Conclusion: AdaBrain-Bench为促进稳健和通用的神经解码解决方案提供了一个持续演进的平台。

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer a safe and accessible
means of connecting the human brain to external devices, with broad
applications in home and clinical settings to enhance human capabilities.
However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive
signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of
self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI
research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture
generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled
electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite
these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and
extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models
across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this
challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to
systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI
tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI
decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task
adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a
set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for
assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer
settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We
leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain
foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate
models in various scenarios. We make our benchmark pipeline available to enable
reproducible research and external use, offering a continuously evolving
platform to foster progress toward robust and generalized neural decoding
solutions.

Conclusion: TolerantECG是一种有效的鲁棒性ECG信号处理模型，能够应对噪声和导联缺失的挑战。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing
heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or
unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings,
resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise
and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG.
TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning
frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their
corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted
or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that
TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across
various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and
achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Motivation: 传统方法将时间序列视为离散序列，忽略了其作为连续过程噪声样本的本质，导致无法唯一确定连续函数。

Method: 提出NeuTSFlow框架，利用神经算子进行流匹配，学习历史与未来函数族之间的路径，参数化无限维函数空间中的速度场。

Result: 在多样化的预测任务中，NeuTSFlow表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 函数族视角在时间序列预测中具有有效性，NeuTSFlow通过直接建模函数级特征，超越了传统方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet
conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their
origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy
observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they
correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can
be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a
shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as
learning the transition from the historical function family to the future
function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we
leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships
between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the
transition path in function space from the historical function family to the
future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a
novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for
learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By
parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function
spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies
at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.
Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior
accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family
perspective.

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent
graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks
(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of
high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to
ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph
constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents
challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary
edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of
continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information
loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard
graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,
potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering
outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph
Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately
characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge
weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC
framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative
binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed
soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering
optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that
scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,
cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its
substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our
understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络从有限训练中实现无限泛化的一种机制。

Abstract: Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable
ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on
generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some
settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the
bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite
generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been
learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop
an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a
simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show
that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase
transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for
the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger
effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that
reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which
neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.

Abstract: Extracting cause and effect phrases from a sentence is an important NLP task,
with numerous applications in various domains, including legal, medical,
education, and scientific research. There are many unsupervised and supervised
methods proposed for solving this task. Among these, unsupervised methods
utilize various linguistic tools, including syntactic patterns, dependency
tree, dependency relations, etc. among different sentential units for
extracting the cause and effect phrases. On the other hand, the contemporary
supervised methods use various deep learning based mask language models
equipped with a token classification layer for extracting cause and effect
phrases. Linguistic tools, specifically, dependency tree, which organizes a
sentence into different semantic units have been shown to be very effective for
extracting semantic pairs from a sentence, but existing supervised methods do
not have any provision for utilizing such tools within their model framework.
In this work, we propose DepBERT, which extends a transformer-based model by
incorporating dependency tree of a sentence within the model framework.
Extensive experiments over three datasets show that DepBERT is better than
various state-of-the art supervised causality extraction methods.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains,
such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their
internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for
interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a
Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM
(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation
patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a
sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the
adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we
employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while
silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a
statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively
led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative
analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's
ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This
paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an
opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable
neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade
artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and
validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR
50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear
operations.

Result: 在十亿参数和十亿token规模下，MemSinks实现了有效隔离和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemSinks首次证明泛化与隔离可同时实现，为隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,
posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to
remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such
approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show
that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically
plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language
abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we
put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization
by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of
memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the
dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates
isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising
general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter
and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong
generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real
data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整神经元数量的方法，通过训练过程中增减神经元来提升对少数类的识别性能，最终网络结构不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物学启发，人脑在学习过程中会不断生成和修剪神经元，而传统深度学习网络的神经元数量固定，难以应对类别不平衡问题。

Method: 在训练过程中定期增减神经元，保留多数类学习的关键特征，同时为少数类增加神经元，动态调整网络容量。

Result: 在三个数据集和五种模型上的实验表明，该方法优于固定大小网络，且与其他不平衡处理技术结合时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 动态、受生物学启发的网络设计能有效提升类别不平衡数据的性能。

Abstract: In conventional deep learning, the number of neurons typically remains fixed
during training. However, insights from biology suggest that the human
hippocampus undergoes continuous neuron generation and pruning of neurons over
the course of learning, implying that a flexible allocation of capacity can
contribute to enhance performance. Real-world datasets often exhibit class
imbalance situations where certain classes have far fewer samples than others,
leading to significantly reduce recognition accuracy for minority classes when
relying on fixed size networks.To address the challenge, we propose a method
that periodically adds and removes neurons during training, thereby boosting
representational power for minority classes. By retaining critical features
learned from majority classes while selectively increasing neurons for
underrepresented classes, our approach dynamically adjusts capacity during
training. Importantly, while the number of neurons changes throughout training,
the final network size and structure remain unchanged, ensuring efficiency and
compatibility with deployment.Furthermore, by experiments on three different
datasets and five representative models, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms fixed size networks and shows even greater accuracy when
combined with other imbalance-handling techniques. Our results underscore the
effectiveness of dynamic, biologically inspired network designs in improving
performance on class-imbalanced data.

Abstract: Deep learning-based prediction models for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of
hardware designs often struggle to generalize. In this paper, we study how to
close the generalizability gap of these models through pretraining on synthetic
data and introduce Iceberg, a synthetic data augmentation approach that expands
both large language model (LLM)-generated programs and weak labels of unseen

in-context model architecture, enabling meta-learning from actual and proximate
labels. Iceberg improves the geometric mean modeling accuracy by $86.4\%$ when
adapt to six real-world applications with few-shot examples and achieves a

Conclusion: 该研究为招聘行业提供了改进职位分类准确性的框架，支持更明智的决策。

Abstract: In the dynamic realm of online recruitment, accurate job classification is
paramount for optimizing job recommendation systems, search rankings, and labor
market analyses. As job markets evolve, the increasing complexity of job titles
and descriptions necessitates sophisticated models that can effectively
leverage intricate relationships within job data. Traditional text
classification methods often fall short, particularly due to their inability to
fully utilize the hierarchical nature of industry categories. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation learning and classification
model that embeds jobs and hierarchical industry categories into a latent
embedding space. Our model integrates the Standard Occupational Classification
(SOC) system and an in-house hierarchical taxonomy, Carotene, to capture both
graph and hierarchical relationships, thereby improving classification
accuracy. By embedding hierarchical industry categories into a shared latent
space, we tackle cold start issues and enhance the dynamic matching of
candidates to job opportunities. Extensive experimentation on a large-scale
dataset of job postings demonstrates the model's superior ability to leverage
hierarchical structures and rich semantic features, significantly outperforming
existing methods. This research provides a robust framework for improving job
classification accuracy, supporting more informed decision-making in the
recruitment industry.

Result: RNE在模拟和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时缓解了冷启动问题。

Conclusion: 论文提出的距离估计方法和RNE在推荐系统中具有优越性能，并解决了冷启动问题。

Abstract: Recommender systems inherently exhibit a low-rank structure in latent space.
A key challenge is to define meaningful and measurable distances in the latent
space to capture user-user, item-item, user-item relationships effectively. In
this work, we establish that distances in the latent space can be
systematically approximated using row-wise and column-wise distances in the
observed matrix, providing a novel perspective on distance estimation. To
refine the distance estimation, we introduce the correction based on empirical
variance estimator to account for noise-induced non-centrality. The novel
distance estimation enables a more structured approach to constructing
neighborhoods, leading to the Radial Neighborhood Estimator (RNE), which
constructs neighborhoods by including both overlapped and partially overlapped
user-item pairs and employs neighborhood smoothing via localized kernel
regression to improve imputation accuracy. We provide the theoretical
asymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator. We perform evaluations on both
simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that RNE achieves superior
performance compared to existing collaborative filtering and matrix
factorization methods. While our primary focus is on distance estimation in
latent space, we find that RNE also mitigates the ``cold-start'' problem.

<details>

Motivation: 现有GNNWR方法在建模空间非平稳性时受限于固定距离方案和有限的归纳偏差，需要更灵活的模型。

Method: 结合CNN、RNN和Transformer的机制，改进GNNWR，引入局部感受野、序列上下文和自注意力。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了改进GNNWR优于传统方法，尤其在非线性空间关系中表现突出。

Conclusion: 归纳偏差对空间建模至关重要，未来可探索可学习的空间权重函数和混合神经架构。

Abstract: Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how
well a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This
work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted
Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for
modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional
Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial
weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed
distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize
GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent
neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,
sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through
extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying
heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic
methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results
also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,
with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,
and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These
findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and
suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions,
hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling
non-stationary spatial data.

Conclusion: TDCRL通过因果学习机制有效提取域不变特征，显著提升源自由域泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning often struggles when training and test data distributions
differ. Traditional domain generalization (DG) tackles this by including data
from multiple source domains, which is impractical due to expensive data
collection and annotation. Recent vision-language models like CLIP enable
source-free domain generalization (SFDG) by using text prompts to simulate
visual representations, reducing data demands. However, existing SFDG methods
struggle with domain-specific confounders, limiting their generalization
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose TDCRL
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{L}earning), the first method to integrate causal inference into the
SFDG setting. TDCRL operates in two steps: first, it employs data augmentation
to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to
generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains
a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract
domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a
clear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features,
ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet show state-of-the-art performance, proving TDCRL
effectiveness in SFDG.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained significant attention
for solving compliance minimization (CM) problems. However, these methods
typically provide poor feature boundaries, are very expensive, and lack a
systematic mechanism to control the design complexity. Herein, we address these
limitations by proposing a mesh-free and simultaneous framework based on
physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). In our approach, we parameterize the
design and state variables with GP priors which have independent kernels but
share a multi-output neural network (NN) as their mean function. The
architecture of this NN is based on Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention
Networks (PGCANs) which not only mitigate spectral bias issues, but also
provide an interpretable mechanism to control design complexity. We estimate
all the parameters of our GP-based representations by simultaneously minimizing
the compliance, total potential energy, and residual of volume fraction
constraint. Importantly, our loss function exclude all data-based residuals as
GPs automatically satisfy them. We also develop computational schemes based on
curriculum training and numerical integration to increase the efficiency and
robustness of our approach which is shown to (1) produce super-resolution
topologies with fast convergence, (2) achieve smaller compliance and less gray
area fraction compared to traditional numerical methods, (3) provide control
over fine-scale features, and (4) outperform competing ML-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as
reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant
attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship
between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive
performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks,
particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work
advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation,
incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous
degree distributions and community structures, which are typical
characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a
nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model
networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a
biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We
examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image
classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect
performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely
interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The
comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our
findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth
further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and
machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more
biologically informed neural networks.

progression through lagged effects, enhancing its capacity to reflect complex

Result: scMPT表现优于单独使用scGPT或LLMs，且性能更稳定。

Conclusion: LLMs可以补充单细胞基础模型，提升单细胞分析性能。

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant
advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are
inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as
text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several
recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell
foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little
understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus
on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to
single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what
biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to
single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies
between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these
insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either
of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between
each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods,
demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with
scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for
LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in
single-cell analysis.

Conclusion: 该流程显著提升了对抗性鲁棒决策树训练的效率和可持续性。

Abstract: As machine learning gets adopted into the industry quickly, trustworthiness
is increasingly in focus. Yet, efficiency and sustainability of robust training
pipelines still have to be established. In this work, we consider a simple
pipeline for training adversarially robust decision trees and investigate the
efficiency of each step. Our pipeline consists of three stages. Firstly, we
choose the perturbation size automatically for each dataset. For that, we
introduce a simple algorithm, instead of relying on intuition or prior work.
Moreover, we show that the perturbation size can be estimated from smaller
models than the one intended for full training, and thus significant gains in
efficiency can be achieved. Secondly, we train state-of-the-art adversarial
training methods and evaluate them regarding both their training time and
adversarial accuracy. Thirdly, we certify the robustness of each of the models
thus obtained and investigate the time required for this. We find that
verification time, which is critical to the efficiency of the full pipeline, is
not correlated with training time.

Abstract: Tabular data synthesis for supervised learning ('SL') model training is
gaining popularity in industries such as healthcare, finance, and retail.
Despite the progress made in tabular data generators, models trained with
synthetic data often underperform compared to those trained with original data.
This low SL utility of synthetic data stems from class imbalance exaggeration
and SL data relationship overlooked by tabular generator. To address these
challenges, we draw inspirations from techniques in emerging data-centric
artificial intelligence and elucidate Pruning and ReOrdering ('PRRO'), a novel
pipeline that integrates data-centric techniques into tabular data synthesis.
PRRO incorporates data pruning to guide the table generator towards
observations with high signal-to-noise ratio, ensuring that the class
distribution of synthetic data closely matches that of the original data.
Besides, PRRO employs a column reordering algorithm to align the data modeling
structure of generators with that of SL models. These two modules enable PRRO
to optimize SL utility of synthetic data. Empirical experiments on 22 public
datasets show that synthetic data generated using PRRO enhances predictive
performance compared to data generated without PRRO. Specifically, synthetic
replacement of original data yields an average improvement of 26.74% and up to
871.46% improvement using PRRO, while synthetic appendant to original data
results with PRRO-generated data results in an average improvement of 6.13% and
up to 200.32%. Furthermore, experiments on six highly imbalanced datasets show
that PRRO enables the generator to produce synthetic data with a class
distribution that resembles the original data more closely, achieving a
similarity improvement of 43%. Through PRRO, we foster a seamless integration
of data synthesis to subsequent SL prediction, promoting quality and accessible
data analysis.

Result: 算法在非凸条件下达到$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$的样本复杂度，优于之前的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$。

Conclusion: VR-CR-PN是首个结合Hessian辅助方差减少的二阶策略优化算法，显著提升了性能且无需重要性采样。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in
reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from
suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about
importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a
variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance
reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the
distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under
general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We
theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order
stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an
additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the
expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the
horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent
sample complexity.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing
sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of
renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a
neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet
transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of
time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the
Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections
to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through
wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly
captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated
across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity
transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this
architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various
forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal
dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP
analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized,
privacy-preserving learning, particularly relevant in the era of interconnected

Federated Learning faces three primary challenges: the need for human
involvement in costly data labelling processes for target adaptation, covariate
shift in client device data collection due to environmental factors affecting
sensors, leading to discrepancies between source and target samples, and the
impracticality of continuous or regular model updates in resource-constrained
environments due to limited data transmission capabilities and technical
constraints on channel availability and energy efficiency. To tackle these
issues, we expand upon an efficient and scalable Federated Learning framework
tailored for real-world client adaptation in industrial settings. This
framework leverages a pre-trained source model comprising a deep backbone, an
adaptation module, and a classifier running on a powerful server. By freezing
the backbone and classifier during client adaptation on resource-constrained
devices, we allow the domain adaptive linear layer to handle target domain
adaptation, thus minimizing overall computational overhead. Furthermore, this
setup, designated as FedAcross+, is extended to encompass the processing of
streaming data, thereby rendering the solution suitable for non-stationary
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
FedAcross+ in achieving competitive adaptation on low-end client devices with
limited target samples, successfully addressing the challenge of domain shift.
Moreover, our framework accommodates sporadic model updates within
resource-constrained environments, ensuring practical and seamless deployment.

*Wuyang Zhou,Giorgos Iacovides,Kriton Konstantinidis,Ilya Kisil,Danilo Mandic*

TL;DR: 本文旨在通过实例和可视化解释张量网络（TN）秩的概念，帮助读者理解其在数据分析和模型设计中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量网络秩的概念缺乏统一的解释和直观理解，常被视为经验调参而非设计参数，本文希望通过直观方法澄清这一概念。

Method: 通过真实案例和图形化方法，展示如何根据领域知识选择TN秩，并揭示TN秩与张量展开矩阵秩的关系。

Result: 提供了一种直观理解TN秩的方法，帮助读者在设计和应用张量方法时更有依据。

Conclusion: 本文为读者提供了对TN秩的清晰统一理解，支持其在实践和教育中的应用。

Abstract: Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in
Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank
representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in
handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of
TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.
However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an
intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across
different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as
empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters
inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to
demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks
through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by
illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in
widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker
decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory
graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a
perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the
corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing
cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN
design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear
and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary
physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and
deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational
contexts.

Conclusion: 该方法可用于探索AI玩家的多样化游戏风格，减少对领域专业知识的依赖。

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and
enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents.
Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace
representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate
the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain
abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM
autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level
play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a
meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space,
reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent
space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within
studied AI players.

Result: 当前TGNNs在泛化时序模式方面存在显著不足，传统基准测试可能掩盖了这些挑战。

Conclusion: T-GRAB为开发具有更强时序推理能力的架构提供了方向，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning methods have recently emerged as powerful tools for
modelling relational data evolving through time. However, despite extensive
benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as
periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we
introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set
of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs
to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that
isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions,
inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over
both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning
methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to
generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the
limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional
real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with
stronger temporal reasoning abilities. The code for T-GRAB can be found at:

feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at

Conclusion: 该框架连接了统计充分性、图论表示和深度学习，为神经网络提供了新的统计理解。

Abstract: This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical
sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations,
where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor
points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer
outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the
conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. Under
dense anchor point assumptions, we prove that asymptotic sufficiency holds in
the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. To align more
closely with practical architectures, we further show that sufficiency can be
achieved with finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input
distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. Our framework covers
fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid
activations, and convolutional neural networks. This work bridges statistical
sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a
new statistical understanding of neural networks.

Motivation: 解决PI-ELM在捕捉局部尖锐梯度时的局限性，同时保持其计算速度优势。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现出色，尤其在刚性PDE场景下，精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KAPI-ELM是一种可扩展、可解释且通用的物理信息学习框架，适用于刚性PDE问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Kernel Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning
Machine (KAPI-ELM), an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based extension of
PI-ELM designed to solve both forward and inverse Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) problems involving localized sharp gradients. While PI-ELMs outperform
the traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their
single-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their
fixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp
gradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian
Optimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer
parameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of
hyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input
weights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining
BO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization
for output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's
speed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the
proposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks,
including a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson
equation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation.
Notably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and
inverse settings. In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced
methods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while
requiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters. These results
establish the potential of KAPI-ELM as a scalable, interpretable, and
generalizable physics-informed learning framework, especially in stiff PDE
regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成化学语言模型在药物发现中缺乏可靠奖励信号和输出可解释性的问题。

Result: 在零样本评估中，SAFE-T性能优于或与现有方法相当，且速度更快，同时支持可解释的分子设计。

Conclusion: 条件生成化学语言模型可以统一评分和生成，加速早期药物发现。

Abstract: Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains
limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of
interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical
modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein
targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without
relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T
models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a
biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such
as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff
detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this
learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In
comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,
ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves
performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being
significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T
captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and
biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these
results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and
generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代算法处理的数据集通常规模大且动态变化，若层次聚类对数据扰动敏感，会降低算法实用性。因此，研究层次$k$-中位数聚类的平均敏感性具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一种高效的层次$k$-中位数聚类算法，并理论证明了其低平均敏感性和高聚类质量。同时分析了单链接聚类和CLNSS算法的敏感性。

Result: 实验验证了所提算法的鲁棒性和有效性，同时发现单链接聚类和CLNSS算法的确定性变体具有高敏感性，稳定性较差。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的层次$k$-中位数聚类算法在保持高质量的同时具有低敏感性，适用于动态数据集，提升了算法的实用性。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for unsupervised learning
with numerous applications. However, in the application of modern algorithms,
the datasets studied are usually large and dynamic. If the hierarchical
clustering is sensitive to small perturbations of the dataset, the usability of
the algorithm will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we focus on the
hierarchical $k$ -median clustering problem, which bridges hierarchical and
centroid-based clustering while offering theoretical appeal, practical utility,
and improved interpretability. We analyze the average sensitivity of algorithms
for this problem by measuring the expected change in the output when a random
data point is deleted. We propose an efficient algorithm for hierarchical
$k$-median clustering and theoretically prove its low average sensitivity and
high clustering quality. Additionally, we show that single linkage clustering
and a deterministic variant of the CLNSS algorithm exhibit high average
sensitivity, making them less stable. Finally, we validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments.

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and
improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for
cognitive assessment but have traditionally relied on manual scoring. Automatic
dementia classification (ADC) systems aim to infer cognitive decline directly
from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework
based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation
with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments
administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were
diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms
prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using
fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that
our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models,
paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端间歇性参与和未知参与概率的实际挑战，现有方法通常假设全设备参与或已知均匀分布，这在现实中很少成立。

Method: 通过随机和可变大小的客户端参与，分析了经典的“不可知联邦平均（FedAvg）”算法的优化问题，并严格证明了其在凸、可能非光滑损失下的收敛性。

Result: 在未知参与分布的情况下，首次为不可知FedAvg提供了收敛性保证，并实证表明其优于常见的加权聚合FedAvg变体。

Conclusion: 不可知FedAvg在随机和非均匀客户端参与下具有理论收敛性，且在实际中表现优于已知参与权重的加权聚合方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without
centralizing raw data. However, practical FL deployments often face a key
realistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation
and with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing
convergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on
knowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions
that rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization
problem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known
\emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and
variably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence
for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our
analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under
general, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the
participation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic
FedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg
variants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供基准，并建议提升运动捕捉数据的完整性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often
compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a
systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is
lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis
of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our
evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,
multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To
facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap
dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate
practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing
completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent
pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic
variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks
consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex
missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean
absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate
techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative
Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the
highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical
baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving
the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.

Abstract: This paper examines the $L_p$ and $W^1_p$ norm approximation errors of ReLU

derive nearly optimal super-approximation error bounds of order $2m$ in the
$L_p$ norm and order $2m-2$ in the $W^1_p$ norm, for target functions with
$L_p$ mixed derivative of order $m$ in each direction. The analysis leverages
sparse grid finite elements and the bit extraction technique. Our results
improve upon classical lowest order $L_\infty$ and $H^1$ norm error bounds and
demonstrate that the expressivity of neural networks is largely unaffected by
the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: In this paper, we design an algorithm to accelerate the diffusion process on

necessitates substantial time for denoising perturbed data. To overcome this

diffusion models to address the pose ambiguity problem. Moreover, we show that
this acceleration advantage occurs without any measurable degradation in task

4.9$\times$, significantly reducing the latency for generating a single sample.

Method: 提出FedFD，利用正交投影对齐客户端模型特征，减少知识偏差。

Conclusion: FedFD通过特征蒸馏有效解决了异构联邦学习中的知识偏差问题。

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing
attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models
while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,
ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often
employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global
model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not
always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The
reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,
while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for
the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous
Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature
information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous
models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge
distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to
maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align
the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize
the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and
thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TAT模型在销售高峰事件中显著提升了预测准确性，为供应链管理提供了更可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as
demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying
and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical
retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons
extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales
events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately.
However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain
operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a
multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as
holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance.
Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel
Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent
alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis
on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We
demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand
forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a powerful surrogate
modeling framework for learning solution operators in PDE-governed systems.
While their use is expanding across engineering disciplines, applications in
geotechnical engineering remain limited. This study systematically evaluates
several DeepONet architectures for the one-dimensional consolidation problem.
We initially consider three architectures: a standard DeepONet with the
coefficient of consolidation embedded in the branch net (Models 1 and 2), and a
physics-inspired architecture with the coefficient embedded in the trunk net
(Model 3). Results show that Model 3 outperforms the standard configurations
(Models 1 and 2) but still has limitations when the target solution (excess
pore pressures) exhibits significant variation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Trunknet Fourier feature-enhanced DeepONet (Model 4) that addresses
the identified limitations by capturing rapidly varying functions. All proposed
architectures achieve speedups ranging from 1.5 to 100 times over traditional
explicit and implicit solvers, with Model 4 being the most efficient. Larger
computational savings are expected for more complex systems than the explored
1D case, which is promising. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
DeepONets to enable efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnical
applications, advancing the integration of scientific machine learning in
geotechnics, which is at an early stage.

Abstract: With the rise of smart mobility and shared e-mobility services, numerous
advanced technologies have been applied to this field. Cloud-based traffic
simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic
representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as
pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including
intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis.
As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive
end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a
cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile
application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is
evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios.
Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level

TL;DR: TagBERT是一种基于依赖感知的Transformer语言模型，利用语义标签改进查询重构任务，性能优于BERT等模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子商务搜索引擎中查询与用户意图不匹配的问题，传统方法未充分利用语义标签。

Method: 将查询重构视为令牌分类任务，设计TagBERT模型，结合语义标签学习查询短语嵌入。

Result: 在大型电子商务数据集上，TagBERT表现优于BERT、eBERT等竞争模型。

Conclusion: TagBERT通过语义标签显著提升查询重构效果，适用于电子商务搜索场景。

Abstract: The major task of any e-commerce search engine is to retrieve the most
relevant inventory items, which best match the user intent reflected in a
query. This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous
queries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or
under-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To
address these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user
query through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to
bridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early
methods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from
token co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or
purchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically
transformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are
being used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize
the semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user
intent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a
token classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware
transformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of
a token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large,
real-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance
than plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and
Sequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.

Result: NNP能准确估计活化能、预测立体选择性，并复现天然产物合成的关键步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂反应机制搜索提供了高效、经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide
insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems.
However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found
in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search
process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search
strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary
family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective
strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining
graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for
intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network
potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate
reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate
activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity,
and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.

Motivation: 传统算子学习方法难以量化不确定性，SON旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将分支网络建模为SDE，通过伴随BSDE反向传播，利用随机最大值原理的哈密顿梯度更新SGD。

Result: SON在2D和3D噪声算子复制中表现出色。

Conclusion: SON能有效学习算子中的不确定性，适用于高维噪声场景。

Abstract: We develop a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in operator
learning, the Stochastic Operator Network (SON). SON combines the stochastic
optimal control concepts of the Stochastic Neural Network (SNN) with the
DeepONet. By formulating the branch net as an SDE and backpropagating through
the adjoint BSDE, we replace the gradient of the loss function with the
gradient of the Hamiltonian from Stohastic Maximum Principle in the SGD update.
This allows SON to learn the uncertainty present in operators through its
diffusion parameters. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of SON when
replicating several noisy operators in 2D and 3D.

Result: 蒸馏模型在SINR水平上表现出更低的错误率，验证了KD在能效AI中的有效性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏可有效实现高性能且低能耗的AI解决方案。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with
performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based
on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy
consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and
FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage,
influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy
dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the
application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX
\textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher}
model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student
model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is
measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus
Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and
a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error
floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving
energy-efficient AI solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言建模存在模糊性问题，同一上下文可能有多个合理的未来句子。LoRA-MCL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多选择学习（MCL）和Winner-Takes-All损失，利用低秩适应（LoRA）高效处理模糊性。

Result: 在视觉和音频字幕生成任务中，LoRA-MCL生成的输出具有高多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: LoRA-MCL通过理论假设和实验验证，有效解决了语言建模中的模糊性问题。

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in
language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence
continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an
intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be
equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and
the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying
Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated
from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use
data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive
experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method
achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

TL;DR: 通过最优传输理论视角，研究分布偏移下保形预测的覆盖损失估计与缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保形预测在分布偏移下可能失效，现有方法需预先知道偏移类型，限制了实用性。

Method: 利用最优传输理论，估计并缓解分布偏移导致的覆盖损失。

Result: 证明了在分布偏移下仍能有效估计和调整覆盖损失。

Conclusion: 最优传输理论为处理保形预测中的分布偏移提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method
that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its
finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split
conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to
collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet
seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration
and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and
often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature
is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable
setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of
distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this
problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show
that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of
distribution shift.

TL;DR: CLA是一种自监督学习策略，用于在线持续学习，通过对齐当前与过去的表征来减少遗忘，加速训练收敛，并在预训练阶段表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线持续学习场景中，数据以小批量到达，计算预算固定且无任务边界，现有自监督学习方法较少。

Method: 提出Continual Latent Alignment (CLA)，通过对齐当前模型与过去表征来缓解遗忘。

Result: CLA加速了在线场景下的训练收敛，并在相同计算预算下优于现有方法；作为预训练协议时，早期表现优于全i.i.d.预训练。

Conclusion: CLA是一种有效的在线持续学习自监督策略，兼具训练效率和最终性能优势。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

Result: 揭示了VLMs的不足，并对其能力、鲁棒性和视觉信息处理方式提出了重要观察。

Conclusion: 研究结果将为改进VLMs提供指导。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for
addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been
shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual
understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations
of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that
probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we
go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final
performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the
performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual
encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In
doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important
observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual
information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving
VLMs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了优化问题中梯度下降的收敛性，特别是通过Polyak-Łojasiewicz不等式（PLI）及其推广条件，分析了连续时间和离散时间LQR问题的差异，并研究了梯度估计误差的影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决连续时间LQR问题中收敛速率随初始条件增大而消失的现象，与离散时间LQR问题的全局指数收敛形成对比。

Method: 方法包括推广PLI条件，并采用输入到状态稳定性（ISS）分析梯度估计误差的影响。

Result: 结果表明，推广的PLI条件有助于理解梯度估计误差对收敛的瞬态和渐近影响。

Conclusion: 结论指出，推广的PLI条件是理解优化问题收敛行为的关键，尤其是在存在误差的情况下。

Abstract: Solutions of optimization problems, including policy optimization in
reinforcement learning, typically rely upon some variant of gradient descent.
There has been much recent work in the machine learning, control, and
optimization communities applying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Inequality (PLI) to
such problems in order to establish an exponential rate of convergence (a.k.a.
``linear convergence'' in the local-iteration language of numerical analysis)
of loss functions to their minima under the gradient flow. Often, as is the
case of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate
vanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /
locally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time
LQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT
and DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like
conditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these
generalizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects
of errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from
adversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a
simulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic
computations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from
limited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of
this issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of
``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv
skips that part (to be updated). Much of the work described here was done in
collaboration with Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping
Jiang, and Milad Siami.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统加权NMF方法对异常值有抵抗力，但收敛速度慢。

Method: 采用加权中位数变换自适应平滑数据，与Fast-HALS算法兼容。

Result: 在图像数据集上，Target Polish的准确性与最先进的鲁棒NMF方法相当或更好，计算时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: Target Polish在保持高效的同时，显著提升了鲁棒性和计算速度。

Abstract: This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally
efficient framework for nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization. Although
conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge
slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective
criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the
Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing
the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides
outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update
structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted
with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the
Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art
robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in
the studied scenarios.

Motivation: 解决神经网络持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 使用PermutedMNIST和RotatedMNIST基准，比较EWC、L2正则化和SGD。

Result: EWC显著减少遗忘，但新任务学习效率略有下降。

Conclusion: EWC是神经网络终身学习的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is the primary challenge that hinders continual
learning, which refers to a neural network ability to sequentially learn
multiple tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Elastic Weight
Consolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic
consolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this
problem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating
EWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST
benchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how
different approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability. Our results
confirm what was shown in previous research, showing that EWC significantly
reduces forgetting compared to naive training while slightly compromising
learning efficiency on new tasks. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
dropout regularization and varying hyperparameters, offering insights into the
generalization of EWC across diverse learning scenarios. These results
underscore EWC's potential as a viable solution for lifelong learning in neural
networks.

Motivation: SL虽能保护客户端数据，但易受攻击，现有FSS方法未能全面应对。

Method: 扩展FSS与SL结合至U形SL，隐藏标签并抵御多种攻击。

Result: 实验显示，相比纯FSS，SplitHappens减少训练时间和通信成本，保持准确率。

Conclusion: SplitHappens为SL提供更高安全性，适用于多种攻击场景。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) -- splits a model into two distinct parts to help protect
client data while enhancing Machine Learning (ML) processes. Though promising,
SL has proven vulnerable to different attacks, thus raising concerns about how
effective it may be in terms of data privacy. Recent works have shown promising
results for securing SL through the use of a novel paradigm, named Function
Secret Sharing (FSS), in which servers obtain shares of a function they compute
and operate on a public input hidden with a random mask. However, these works
fall short in addressing the rising number of attacks which exist on SL. In
SplitHappens, we expand the combination of FSS and SL to U-shaped SL. Similarly
to other works, we are able to make use of the benefits of SL by reducing the
communication and computational costs of FSS. However, a U-shaped SL provides a
higher security guarantee than previous works, allowing a client to keep the
labels of the training data secret, without having to share them with the
server. Through this, we are able to generalize the security analysis of
previous works and expand it to different attack vectors, such as modern model
inversion attacks as well as label inference attacks. We tested our approach
for two different convolutional neural networks on different datasets. These
experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training
time as well as the communication costs when compared to simply using FSS while
matching prior accuracy.

robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop
that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across

identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity
and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of
publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building
benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological
systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data
curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open,
collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust
benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for
ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately
advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries,
therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

Conclusion: 建议在无污染基准和多样化模型上评估RL方法，以确保结论的可信度。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

Conclusion: DP-AdamBC能有效缓解重尾类别不平衡带来的问题，提升低频类别的学习效果。

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the optimization behaviour of common private

Descent with differential privacy (DP-GD) suffers when learning low-frequency
classes, whereas optimization algorithms that estimate second-order information
do not. In particular, DP-AdamBC that removes the DP bias from estimating loss
curvature is a crucial component to avoid the ill-condition caused by
heavy-tail class imbalance, and empirically fits the data better with
$\approx8\%$ and $\approx5\%$ increase in training accuracy when learning the
least frequent classes on both controlled experiments and real data
respectively.

Result: 在六个领域任务中，GWM表现优于或匹配领域专用基线，并展示了零样本/少样本学习能力。

Conclusion: GWM是一种通用世界模型，能够高效处理多模态和图结构数据，适用于跨领域任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,
and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and
cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in
the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,
they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal
data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the
Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and
graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse
tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to
aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space
by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal
embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces
action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other
nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on
six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,
recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,
and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches
domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and
demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our
code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.

Motivation: 现有应用多依赖单一后端模型，限制了能力覆盖并导致性能和成本效率低下，因此需要利用LLM路由数据揭示模型在不同任务中的优势。

Method: 提出FusionBench基准和FusionFactory框架，包括查询级、思维级和模型级融合，通过路由和蒸馏技术优化模型选择与能力转移。

Result: 实验表明FusionFactory在所有14个基准测试中均优于单一LLM，且最优融合配置因任务而异。

Conclusion: 系统化的LLM融合能够有效利用互补优势，显著提升整体性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a vibrant
ecosystem of diverse architectures, each with unique strengths due to
differences in design, training data, and objectives. However, most
applications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of
capabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when
tackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing
data, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different
models, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,
we propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks
across five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing
103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.
Building on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework
with three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query
using both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level
fusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers
to similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities
between models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as
training data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best
individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations
varying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in
harnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经DNF模型在翻译后性能下降，部分原因是未能解缠学习到的知识。

Method: 提出解缠方法，拆分嵌套规则节点为独立节点。

Result: 在多种分类任务中，解缠方法提供了紧凑且可解释的逻辑表示，性能更接近翻译前模型。

Conclusion: 解缠方法有效提升了神经DNF模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and
interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising
results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior
knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the
thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here
that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its
failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the
networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement
method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent
nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through
experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks
(including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our
disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical
representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to
that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kittykg/disentangling-ndnf-classification.
