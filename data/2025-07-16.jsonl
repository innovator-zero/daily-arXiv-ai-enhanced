The actual drain and shipping costs are\ndetermined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution\nof customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be\ndelivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for\nregional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nto develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated\ninto a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be\ndifferentiable.

We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies.

However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,\ndividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination\nexperienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,\naiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The\nresults demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal\nimpact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door\nfor industrial deployment."}

We thus propose a novel\n5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an\nEEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and\ntext embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,\n(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer\nsemantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.\nWe enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment\nand re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates\nhigh-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches\nby 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and\nreducing Fr\\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic\nalignment and image quality."}

To facilitate interactive and\nreal-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer\nthat shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We\nexplore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer\narchitecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal\ncausal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to\nenable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle\nreal-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information\nwhile maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we\npropose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry\ngrounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model\nsupports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,\nFlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments\non various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model\nincreases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive\nperformance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/wzzheng/StreamVGGT."}
