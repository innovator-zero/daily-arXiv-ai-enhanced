To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces.

This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control.

To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based\nsurrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study\ndeveloped a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U\nNet-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate\npredictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming\ntimesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model\ntemporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample\nmechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'\ncontact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements\nin computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN\nmodel was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot\nforming case study using aluminium alloys.

Our\nfindings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall\nperformance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal\nvariant MMVAE\\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics,\nand within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM\ngeneralises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8f6e\u80ce\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u54ea\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9002\u5408\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08VAE\u3001GAN\u3001MMVAE\u3001DDPM\u3001MDM\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cMDM\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0cDDPM\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

To address this, we\nintroduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a\nprediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid\ncombination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel\nPrediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by\neach obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the\nagent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction\noverhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk\nobstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for\nenvironments with a large number of obstacles.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate\nand respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional\ndecoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions\nthat overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to\nthe AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural\nNetwork-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which\nenables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents\nmay react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in\nstructured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI\nsampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior.

This study addresses the\nrobust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for\ntravel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is\nintegrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian\nflows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three\ndifferent approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,\nellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a\ndistributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A\nrealistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center\nis used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot\ndesigns and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a\nconventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability\nunder variable sidewalk conditions.

In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores.

Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset.

In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LGL\u65b9\u6cd5UniLGL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u8d28LiDAR\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86LGL\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6BEV\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUniLGL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLGL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684LGL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid\nedge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast\ninference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates\nhigh-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage\nrefinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while\ninsufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge\nmodel output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates\ncloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the\noptimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.\nSpecifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud\ninference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud\ninference periodically to adjust errors.

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.

Existing methods regard the RGB\ndomain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such\nas daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the\ndomain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple\nsubdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper\nproposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In\nterms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)\nmodule in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In\nterms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which\nrealizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.\nMeanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the\nbaseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR\ndatasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on\nthe FLIR-ADAS dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026-\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684SS-DC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eRGB-IR\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8026\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06RGB\u57df\u89c6\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u57df\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u591a\u5b50\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u767d\u5929\u3001\u591c\u665a\u3001\u96fe\u5929\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347RGB-IR\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e42\u7b49\u89e3\u8026\uff08SAID\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u5149\u8c31\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8026\u5408\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRGB-IR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709UDAOD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eFLIR-ADAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "SS-DC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026-\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RGB-IR\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u5b50\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

These findings\ncorroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended\ninductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of\notherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this\nsupports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations\nmay form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability\nphenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general\nlinear features and possibly Superposition.

Indeed, this was a\nprimary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early\ndays of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed\nthis skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows\nthat sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit\nwell-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This\nsuccess has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model\nfor learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of\nrequired iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We\nargue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another\nperspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the\noptimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative\nproperties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will\nencode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class\nof models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of\nencoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community\nshould aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as\naim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain\nproperties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their\nconvergence rates.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset\nconsisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform\nillumination.

RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge\nwhile maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant\nregardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.\nExperimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual\nlearning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its\neffectiveness in dynamic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RegCL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u975e\u91cd\u653e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "RegCL\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRegCL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RegCL\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While current state-of-the-art methods rely\non discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that\ngenerative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can\nachieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior\nassumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,\ndomain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms\ndomain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with\nmIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings\nhighlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding\ntasks.

The\npremise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each\nother, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when\nlearning the $\\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of\n'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\\epsilon$-optimal\nvalue of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the\n$\\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of\ntransitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity\nhave values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number\nof samples to learn.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers.

While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and\nTargeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,\nexisting neural implementations either rely on \"targeted losses\" that do not\nguarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally\nexpensive post-hoc \"fluctuations\" for multi-parameter settings. We propose\nTargeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly\ninto the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone\narchitecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but\na small \"targeting\" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting\ngradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the\ngradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in\nestimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid\nconfidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal\nestimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting\ngradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits\nclassical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric\nefficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment\neffects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces\nbias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators\nand prior post-hoc approaches.

Existing IoU-based losses\noften incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's\nnon-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.\nHowever, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,\noften leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired\nbehaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU\nobjective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss\nfunction that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the\nIoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to\nbridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides\nmeaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box\nenlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties.

All the code, data, and models will be released to\nfacilitate future research in generative physical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhysX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u78403D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6PhysXNet\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6PhysXGen\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e863D\u8d44\u4ea7\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaPhysXNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faPhysXGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PhysXGen\u5728\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PhysX\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
