### [1] [Spatially Grounded Explanations in Vision Language Models for Document Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12490)
*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Héctor Cerezo-Costas,Dimosthenis Karatzas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EaGERS是一个无需训练、模型无关的流程，通过生成自然语言解释并限制回答生成于相关区域，提升了DocVQA的性能和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升文档视觉问答（DocVQA）的透明度和可重复性，同时避免额外的模型微调。

Method: 1. 通过视觉语言模型生成自然语言解释；2. 通过多模态嵌入相似性和多数投票将解释与空间子区域关联；3. 限制回答仅从相关区域生成。

Result: 在DocVQA数据集上，EaGERS在精确匹配和ANLS指标上优于基础模型，同时增强了透明度和可重复性。

Conclusion: EaGERS提供了一种无需训练的方法，显著提升了DocVQA的性能和解释性。

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

### [2] [MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12508)
*Yuncong Yang,Jiageng Liu,Zheyuan Zhang,Siyuan Zhou,Reuben Tan,Jianwei Yang,Yilun Du,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindJourney通过结合视觉语言模型和可控世界模型，显著提升了3D空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D动态场景推理上表现不佳，缺乏对3D动态的内部建模能力。

Method: 提出MindJourney框架，将视觉语言模型与基于视频扩散的可控世界模型结合，通过迭代生成相机轨迹和多视图推理。

Result: 在SAT基准测试中平均提升8%性能，且无需微调。

Conclusion: 结合世界模型的测试时扩展方法为3D推理提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的单模态多模态大语言模型（MLLM）Mono-InternVL，通过嵌入视觉参数空间和创新的预训练策略，解决了现有模型优化不稳定和灾难性遗忘的问题。后续改进版本Mono-InternVL-1.5进一步降低了训练和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模态MLLM在优化和预训练中存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 通过嵌入视觉参数空间和delta调优，设计了Mono-InternVL及其改进版Mono-InternVL-1.5，并采用创新的Endogenous Visual Pre-training（EViP）策略。

Result: Mono-InternVL在15个基准测试中12个表现最佳，改进版显著降低成本并保持性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了单模态MLLM的性能和效率，为多模态任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

TL;DR: 提出了首个公开的CT眼动数据集CT-ScanGaze和3D扫描路径预测器CT-Searcher，解决了现有方法仅处理2D输入的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解放射科医生在CT阅读中的眼动行为对开发可解释的计算机辅助诊断系统至关重要，但缺乏公开数据集和3D复杂性限制了研究。

Method: 开发了CT-ScanGaze数据集和CT-Searcher预测器，利用2D数据集预训练模型，生成放射科医生类似的3D注视序列。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，并提供了医学影像中3D扫描路径预测的评估框架。

Conclusion: CT-ScanGaze和CT-Searcher为医学影像中的3D眼动研究提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DGCNN++是一种改进的多尺度动态图卷积网络，通过分层多尺度融合和跨尺度信息传播，显著提升了树种类分类和3D物体识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在森林环境中难以捕捉树结构的层次语义关系，导致分类效果不佳。

Method: 采用分层多尺度融合动态图卷积网络，结合局部、分支和冠层尺度的语义特征提取。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如STPCTLS准确率达94.96%，FOR-species20K提升6.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效且适用于资源受限场景，还能泛化到其他点云处理任务。

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Funnel-HOI框架通过编码器阶段引入HOI特定线索，利用非对称共注意力机制和新型损失函数，在完全监督和零样本设置下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HOID中长尾分布问题，提出在编码器阶段引入HOI特定线索以增强场景理解。

Method: 构建Funnel-HOI框架，分阶段探测对象和动作，利用非对称共注意力机制和多模态信息，设计新型损失函数。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上，未见和罕见HOI类别分别提升12.4%和8.4%。

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI通过编码器优化和多模态信息利用，显著提升了HOID性能。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D重建和2D视频扩散模型的新视角合成方法CogNVS，无需测试时优化，支持零样本应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的4D表示测试时优化或无法保持场景几何结构，需要更高效且几何保持的方法。

Method: 结合3D场景重建渲染可见像素，利用自监督2D视频扩散模型填补隐藏像素。

Result: CogNVS在单目视频动态场景新视角合成中优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: CogNVS通过自监督学习和零样本应用，实现了高效且几何保持的动态场景新视角合成。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次结合视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学数据，通过深度学习框架识别心血管疾病的早期生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心血管疾病风险分层方法难以检测早期亚临床变化，缺乏视网膜微血管与脂质组学的整合研究。

Method: 采用深度学习分析视网膜图像，结合UHPLC ESI HRMS技术进行血清脂质分析，进行大规模相关性研究。

Result: 发现视网膜血管特征（如平均动脉宽度）与特定脂质（如TAGs、DAGs）的强相关性，提示代谢压力下的微血管重塑机制。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了早期心血管疾病发病机制的认知空白，为非侵入性生物标志物识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at
https://neuraleaf-yang.github.io/.

Abstract: Spatial grounding, the process of associating natural language expressions
with corresponding image regions, has rapidly advanced due to the introduction
of transformer-based models, significantly enhancing multimodal representation
and cross-modal alignment. Despite this progress, the field lacks a
comprehensive synthesis of current methodologies, dataset usage, evaluation
metrics, and industrial applicability. This paper presents a systematic
literature review of transformer-based spatial grounding approaches from 2018
to 2025. Our analysis identifies dominant model architectures, prevalent
datasets, and widely adopted evaluation metrics, alongside highlighting key
methodological trends and best practices. This study provides essential
insights and structured guidance for researchers and practitioners,
facilitating the development of robust, reliable, and industry-ready
transformer-based spatial grounding models.

accuracy, enhanced responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and improved
interpretability of our approach, thus establishing a new benchmark for
state-of-the-art performance in traffic accident anticipation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairShifter提出了一种新颖的“锚帧+动画”框架，用于高质量视频发型转移，结合了图像发型转移模块和多尺度门控SPADE解码器，实现了时空一致性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频发型转移在社交媒体、游戏等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法在时间一致性、空间保真度和动态适应性方面存在挑战。

Method: HairShifter框架包含图像发型转移模块（IHT）和多尺度门控SPADE解码器，确保每帧精确转换和时空一致性。

Result: 实验表明，HairShifter在视频发型转移中实现了最先进的性能，具有高视觉质量和时间一致性。

Conclusion: HairShifter为视频发型转移开辟了新途径，并建立了该领域的强大基线。

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

TL;DR: Mamba Snake是一种基于状态空间建模的深度蛇形框架，用于统一医学图像分割（UMIS），通过层次化状态空间图谱和多尺度信息聚合提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统像素级方法缺乏对象级解剖洞察和器官间关系建模，难以处理形态复杂性和特征冲突，限制了UMIS的效果。

Method: 提出Mamba Snake框架，结合状态空间建模和蛇形演化，引入Mamba Evolution Block（MEB）进行时空信息聚合，并利用能量图形状先验和双分类协同机制优化分割。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上，Mamba Snake平均Dice分数比现有方法提高3%。

Conclusion: Mamba Snake通过多尺度建模和协同优化机制，显著提升了UMIS的分割效果。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在MEAD和HDTF基准上达到最优性能，并展示零样本生成能力。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了情感说话头生成的自然性和表现力。

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Conclusion: 该系统证明了多无人机协作在海洋追踪中的可行性，为规模化自主监测奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D

under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

Motivation: 减少对任务特定演示的依赖，提高VLA模型的泛化能力和数据收集效率。

Result: 实验显示AnyPos-ATARA管道在测试准确率上提升51%，下游任务成功率提高30-40%。

Conclusion: 任务无关动作范式结合ATARA和AnyPos模型，显著提升了VLA模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Stable Diffusion模型中注意力操作的高计算复杂度问题，现有标记合并方法未充分考虑图像生成模型的特点。

Method: 通过定义局部窗口边界并调整窗口大小，选择代表性标记（相似度最高的标记）进行合并，保留关键局部特征。

Result: 实验显示ReToM在FID指标上提升6.2%，CLIP分数更高，且推理时间相近。

Conclusion: ReToM在视觉质量和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer是一种高效且理论支持的紧凑Transformer改进方法。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）主要针对室内场景，难以处理户外大规模场景的多视角、多模态数据融合问题。

Method: 构建SVM-City数据集，包含多尺度、多视角和多模态数据；提出City-VLM模型，通过联合概率分布空间实现多模态融合。

Result: City-VLM在三个典型户外场景理解任务中平均性能提升18.14%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个户外场景中表现出实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

Motivation: 长尾场景中类别样本量的差异导致低频类别性能下降，现有方法忽视文本编码器的语义信息，且现有损失函数忽略不一致的类条件分布。

Method: 提出SG-Adapter，将类别描述作为语义引导融入视觉微调过程；设计分布不匹配感知补偿因子，修正预测偏差。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，Sage能有效提升长尾学习性能。

Conclusion: Sage通过多模态对齐和预测偏差修正，显著提升了长尾场景下的模型性能。

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强基础理解提升了模型的泛化和推理能力。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

Conclusion: MCoT-RE在无需训练的方法中达到最优性能，平衡了文本修改和视觉上下文。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR-Net提出了一种多阶段融合框架，通过增强语义对齐和自适应协调，解决了早期和晚期融合在组合图像检索中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索中，早期融合过于关注文本细节而忽略视觉上下文，晚期融合难以捕捉细粒度语义对齐。

Method: FAR-Net结合增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）和自适应协调模块（ARM），分别采用晚期和早期融合策略。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上，FAR-Net在Recall@1和Recall@50上分别提升了2.4%和1.04%。

Conclusion: FAR-Net为组合图像检索任务提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Motivation: 解决基于学习的单目VO在鲁棒性、泛化性和效率上的挑战，尤其是DINOv2在VO中因特征粒度粗而受限的问题。

Method: 提出DINO-VO系统，结合DINOv2的语义特征与几何特征，使用关键点检测器和Transformer匹配器优化相机运动估计。

Result: 在TartanAir和KITTI数据集上优于现有VO方法，运行效率高（72 FPS），内存占用低（<1GB）。

Conclusion: DINO-VO在鲁棒性、泛化性和效率上表现优异，适用于户外驾驶场景，与视觉SLAM系统竞争。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的视觉语言导航方法受限于固定知识库和推理能力，无法有效利用经验知识，缺乏进化能力。

Method: SE-VLN包含三个核心模块：分层记忆模块、检索增强的思维推理模块和反思模块，分别用于知识存储、经验检索和多步决策。

Result: 在R2R和REVERSE数据集上，SE-VLN的导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，比现有方法提升了23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化框架的潜力，其性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRE的注意力重聚焦方案，用于减少CLIP在领域泛化中的领域偏移，通过模拟目标域、重聚焦注意力和集成学习来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在领域泛化中难以聚焦于跨领域的任务相关区域（即领域不变区域），导致在未见目标域上表现不佳。

Method: SRE通过模拟目标域、重聚焦注意力和集成学习来减少领域偏移，具体包括数据增强生成模拟目标域、注意力对齐和集成学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SRE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE通过注意力重聚焦和集成学习有效提升了CLIP在领域泛化中的性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立体匹配模型在泛化性和全局一致性之间存在矛盾，迭代局部搜索方法在受限基准测试中表现良好但缺乏全局一致性，而全局匹配架构因计算和内存成本过高而难以实现。

Method: $S^2M^2$采用多分辨率Transformer实现长距离对应，结合新型损失函数集中概率于可行匹配，无需依赖成本体积过滤或深度细化堆栈。

Result: $S^2M^2$在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中达到最新技术水平，显著优于先前方法，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$通过全局匹配架构实现了高精度、高效性和泛化性，为立体匹配领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VITA是一种视觉到动作的流匹配策略，通过将潜在视觉表示转化为潜在动作，简化了传统流匹配和扩散策略的复杂条件机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外的条件机制（如交叉注意力）来生成基于视觉信息的动作，导致时间和空间开销。VITA旨在消除这些模块，同时保留生成建模能力。

Method: VITA将潜在图像作为流源，通过自动编码器创建结构化的动作潜在空间，并通过流潜在解码监督流匹配，实现端到端学习。

Result: 在ALOHA平台的复杂双手机器人操作任务中，VITA表现优于或匹配现有生成策略，并将推理延迟降低了50-130%。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅使用MLP层就能解决复杂双手机器人操作任务的流匹配策略，展示了其高效性和简单性。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的高分辨率感知和增强，显著提升了推理分割的精度。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that

we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显性信号（如面部表情、语音或手势），易被掩盖且无法捕捉深层情绪；生理信号方法需要复杂传感器，影响自然行为。

Method: 利用标准高清摄像头捕捉用户眼部外观和头部运动，估计时空注视轨迹，建模注视行为的空间、语义和时态维度。

Result: 揭示了情绪不仅是生理反应，还是人与环境互动的复杂结果，实现了用户无感知、实时、连续的情绪识别。

Conclusion: 该方法在通用性和部署成本上具有优势，为情绪识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

### [46] [LanePerf: a Performance Estimation Framework for Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12894)
*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的车道性能估计框架（LanePerf），用于在无标签情况下评估车道检测模型的性能，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车道检测模型在新环境中因域偏移导致的可靠性问题，避免资源密集的数据收集和标注。

Method: 将五种图像分类性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务，并提出LanePerf框架，结合图像和车道特征。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上，LanePerf表现最佳，MAE为0.117，Spearman系数为0.727。

Conclusion: LanePerf为ADAS提供了高效的无标签性能评估方法，提升了在复杂驾驶场景中的安全性。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护隐私的同时实现多客户端协作学习，但缺乏专门的数据集和高效算法。

Method: 提出Fed-Cyclic（循环拓扑）和Fed-Star（星型拓扑）两种算法，分别通过局部训练和预聚合解决统计异构问题。

Result: 新算法在自建数据集上表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 新数据集和算法为联邦学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出AthleticsPose数据集，用于单目3D姿态估计，显著提升模型性能，并分析了实际应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决运动分析中缺乏真实运动数据集和模型可靠性不明确的问题。

Method: 引入AthleticsPose数据集，训练3D姿态估计模型并进行全面评估。

Result: 模型在真实运动数据上表现优异，MPJPE降低75%，但对高速指标存在预测偏差。

Conclusion: 强调真实运动数据的重要性，为运动分析提供了数据集和实际应用参考。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

TL;DR: Argus是一个新型3D多模态框架，利用多视角图像增强LLMs的3D场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖3D点云，但重建过程中存在信息丢失问题，如纹理缺失或复杂结构导致的细节失真。多视角图像能弥补这些不足。

Method: Argus通过融合多视角图像和相机姿态生成场景特征，与3D特征交互，创建详细的3D感知场景嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，Argus在多种下游任务中优于现有3D-LMMs。

Conclusion: Argus有效弥补了3D点云重建的信息丢失，提升了LLMs对3D世界的理解能力。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Result: 在W4A6和W4A8等低比特宽度下显著优于现有方法，保持高质量图像生成。

Conclusion: DMQ方法有效提升扩散模型量化性能，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding

classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理多模态信息时，输入模态间的不确定性关系及其潜在临床应用尚未完全理解。

Method: 提出MUPM模型，通过不确定性传播分析图像、文本及联合模态的不确定性关系，并在心脏MR扫描和数字健康记录数据上进行优化和验证。

Conclusion: MUPM通过量化不确定性关系，为临床应用提供了高效且实用的工具，能够识别冗余因素并估计整体不确定性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Motivation: 解决扩散变换器（DiTs）在生成长视频时因自注意力机制二次复杂度带来的挑战，同时保持时间连贯性和可扩展性。

Method: 引入FlexFormer，一种表达性自动编码器，将视频和文本联合压缩为统一的潜在表示，支持可变长度输入和线性可调压缩率。

Result: 实验验证了LoViC在多样化任务中的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LoViC通过创新的压缩和上下文编码机制，成功生成长且连贯的视频，为长视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习型DIR框架中正则化参数的调优计算成本高，需要多次训练迭代，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: cIDIR基于INRs，通过正则化超参数的先验分布进行训练，并利用分割掩码优化超参数，同时建模连续可微的DVF。

Result: 在DIR-LAB数据集上评估，cIDIR表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR提供了一种高效且灵活的正则化参数优化方法，适用于学习型DIR框架。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Result: FantasyPortrait在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法，尤其在跨重演和多角色场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait通过创新方法解决了面部动画生成中的关键挑战，并提供了专门的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Conclusion: 该方法在有限数据下显著提升手腕病理识别效果，尤其在骨折诊断中表现突出。

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于预训练RGB扩散模型的两阶段方法，用于从RGB图像重建高光谱图像（HSI），通过分离不可观测特征并建模其分布，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱重建（SR）的关键挑战在于估计RGB图像中未捕获的不可观测光谱特征，需要有效构建光谱-空间联合分布。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）训练光谱不可观测特征自编码器（SpeUAE）压缩特征；2）利用预训练空间自编码器（SpaAE）和扩散模型（ULDM）建模联合分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SR和下游重光照任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过分离不可观测特征并利用RGB预训练模型的空间知识，该方法有效提升了高光谱重建的精度和效率。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DISSect的新方法，通过差分信息选择样本，有效解决噪声对应问题，加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有样本选择方法在冷启动场景下依赖离线选择或未充分处理噪声对应问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用当前模型与历史模型的预测相关性差分，构建差分信息样本选择方法。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和多种下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DISSect方法在样本选择和训练加速方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法依赖大规模像素级标注的问题，探索涂鸦标注作为弱监督形式以提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分布内和分布外数据上均优于现有全监督方法。

Conclusion: 涂鸦标注弱监督方法在图像篡改定位中具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Result: HCS在多种任务中表现出卓越性能和普适性，无需额外微调即可实现快速场景理解。

Conclusion: HCS是一种即插即用的方法，适用于任何VLM，显著提升了复杂场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成细节更丰富的高质量图像，在验证集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 检测器引导的框架有效提升了数据集蒸馏的质量和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Motivation: 在安全关键的机器人应用中，实时准确检测动态对象至关重要。现有方法因使用多个子网络导致计算成本高，影响实时性能。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的通道级运动特征表示方法，仅需姿态网络，无需其他子网络。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，FPS提高了约4倍，参数减少至25%，同时保持同等精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性上均优于现有技术，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）任务中，未知对象的无监督检测和增量学习是主要挑战。PROB模型虽无需伪标签，但存在对象性和类别预测的学习冲突。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB，引入ETOP终止对象性预测，并通过TDQI高效提取已知和未知对象特征。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，Decoupled PROB在多个指标上超越现有方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过解耦对象性和类别预测，解决了学习冲突问题，为OWOD任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释变异性是一个主要挑战，传统深度学习方法难以捕捉注释者偏见。

Method: DiffOSeg采用两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段通过概率共识策略建立群体共识，第二阶段通过自适应提示捕获专家特定偏好。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和NPC-170数据集上，DiffOSeg在所有评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能够同时实现共识和偏好驱动的分割，为医学图像分割提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Method: 结合LoRA和梯度正则化技术，优化模型参数稳定性。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上，GLAD在基类到新类泛化、图像域泛化和跨数据集泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GLAD是一种简单通用的框架，显著提升了小样本学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Result: 分割模型平均Dice系数达82.14%，自动化与手动评估结果无显著差异。

Conclusion: 自动化流程可行，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多原型对齐和关键点引导的聚类，显著提升了3D点云异常检测的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

Conclusion: 多模态方法为红外小目标检测提供了新思路，性能提升显著。

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset

Conclusion: 多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的小目标检测提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉AI中表现优异，但在建筑领域面临数据多样性和数量不足的挑战。

Method: 利用Midjourney生成12,000张合成图像，强调真实性和多样性，用于DNN训练。

Result: 模型在真实数据集上AP为0.937（IoU=0.5）和0.642（IoU=0.5-0.95），在合成数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 生成AI在解决DNN训练数据稀缺问题上有潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术的进步，现有检测方法主要针对DeepFakes，无法应对通用内容视频的检测需求。

Result: 在包含10,000个AI生成视频和4,000个真实视频的数据集上，平均检测准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，计划公开代码、模型和数据集以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到预训练ViT的权重矩阵向量具有近似正交性，而低秩适应矩阵（如LoRA和Adapter）缺乏这一特性，因此探索如何通过正交性提升微调后的泛化能力。

Method: 使用单个可学习向量生成近似正交向量，构建低秩适应矩阵（down/up-projection），使其与预训练权重矩阵的正交性一致。

Result: 实验表明，AOFT在多个下游图像分类任务中表现优异，验证了正交性对泛化能力的提升效果。

Conclusion: AOFT通过引入近似正交性，显著提升了微调ViT的泛化能力，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Motivation: 化妆可能干扰年龄验证和面部识别，需防御此类攻击。

Method: 使用文本引导扩散模型DiffClean消除化妆痕迹。

Result: 在模拟和真实化妆图像上，年龄验证准确率提升4.8%，面部识别TMR提升8.9%。

Conclusion: DiffClean有效防御化妆攻击，提升系统准确性。

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 级联架构能高效实现实时交互检测，动作识别触发物体检测模块，提升性能。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,

Conclusion: 滑动迭代去噪有效提升4D一致性，生成高质量新视角视频。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset

Conclusion: AutoPartGen在3D部件生成中表现出色，无需额外优化即可生成连贯对象。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Conclusion: VisionThink在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Conclusion: 小批量耦合能有效提升分层流匹配的建模能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate
continued research, we release our model publicly.

TL;DR: 论文指出机器学习中的并行化存在盲点，即某些问题本质上是顺序性的，无法并行化，这对模型设计和硬件发展有深远影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别并行计算的局限性，强调顺序计算在复杂推理任务中的重要性。

Method: 基于复杂性理论，形式化区分并行与顺序计算问题，并分析当前并行架构的局限性。

Result: 证明并行架构在顺序性任务中存在根本性限制，需重视顺序计算的扩展。

Conclusion: 未来AI发展需同时关注并行和顺序计算的扩展，以应对复杂推理任务。

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型缺乏自主行动和独立推理能力，且难以跨领域整合知识。

Result: 验证测试展示了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 心理意象的引入有助于机器思考过程的启动和跨领域知识整合。

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

<details>

Motivation: 数据流中的概念漂移问题对机器学习提出了挑战，现有方法在处理连续到达的数据时效率不足。

Method: IncA-DES通过训练策略生成局部专家，结合概念漂移检测器和重叠分类过滤器，并使用在线K-d树优化kNN处理时间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和处理时间上优于七种先进方法，且在线K-d树的融合显著提升了处理速度。

Conclusion: IncA-DES是一种高效的数据流处理方法，适用于概念漂移场景，并在开源框架中实现。

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Result: Assay2Mol在生成候选配体分子方面优于现有机器学习方法，且分子更易合成。

Conclusion: Assay2Mol为早期药物发现提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Motivation: 研究排名向量聚类的KRC问题，以解决个性化和大规模决策中的实际需求。

Result: KRCA在合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线方法，显著提升解的质量和计算速度。

Conclusion: KRC在个性化决策中具有实际意义，KRCA为未来研究提供了方法论基础和见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

Motivation: 探索在[0,1]值回归问题中是否存在一种损失函数，能够实现优于对数损失的方差依赖泛化界。

Method: 提出了一种新的损失函数（betting loss），并证明其能够自适应地实现方差依赖的泛化界。

Result: betting loss 实现了方差依赖的泛化界，且无需预先知道方差信息。

Conclusion: betting loss 在[0,1]值回归问题中表现优异，提供了更紧的泛化界。

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 异构表格数据在元学习中的表示仍是一个开放问题，现有方法追求通用性，而本文针对特定元任务（贝叶斯超参数优化预热）设计表示方法。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 深度度量学习；2) 标记重建，均需满足捕捉标记特性的要求。

Result: 实验显示，提出的编码器能有效学习与标记对齐的表示，但在预热任务中性能提升不明显。

Conclusion: 方法虽能学习特定表示，但直接应用于超参数优化预热任务时效果有限。

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM微调的任务混合选择依赖手动和启发式方法，缺乏原则性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用行为差异（如Jensen Shannon Divergence）建模任务关系，通过MRF优化任务比例。

Result: 在Llama 2和Mistral上，TASKPGM在MMLU和BIGBench等评估中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: TASKPGM提供了高效、鲁棒的LLM微调方法，并提供了任务影响和混合组成的可解释性。

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Conclusion: Bootseer有效解决了LLM训练中的启动开销问题，提升了工业级训练效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

Motivation: 神经信号包含敏感信息，传统数据共享方式存在隐私风险，联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 引入基于联邦学习的神经解码方法，并在高维肌电信号的开环和闭环场景中系统评估其性能与隐私。

Result: 开环中联邦学习显著优于本地学习，但闭环中需调整联邦学习方法以适应实时交互，导致本地学习性能更优但隐私风险更高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实时自适应应用中性能与隐私的权衡，指出需要专门为单用户应用设计的联邦学习方法。

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

Result: 实验显示，外推域内相对L2误差平均降低40%，绝对误差降低50%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了PINNs的外推能力，且计算成本未显著增加。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.

Result: 框架提高了训练效率和模型性能，展示了跨模态对齐在样本选择中的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过跨模态对齐实现鲁棒样本选择，推动了数据中心学习的高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Conclusion: LySep模型通过层分离有效解决了深度学习优化问题，提升了求解偏微分方程的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods
and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for
SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and

Result: FLDmamba在时间序列预测基准测试中表现优异，优于Transformer和其他Mamba架构。

Conclusion: FLDmamba有效解决了时间序列预测中的关键挑战，为长期预测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

Motivation: 解决现有基于学习的无损压缩器在压缩比、吞吐量和鲁棒性上的不足。

Method: 提出PMKLC，包含多知识学习框架、GPU加速编码器、并行加速机制和两种压缩模式。

Result: 在15个数据集上，PMKLC-S/M平均压缩比提升73.6%，吞吐量提升3-10倍，鲁棒性最佳。

Conclusion: PMKLC在压缩性能、速度和稳定性上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

Method: 结合降阶模型和算子学习，建立离散化误差界限，并通过数值实验验证。

Result: RONOM在输入泛化、空间超分辨率和离散化鲁棒性上优于现有神经网络算子。

Conclusion: RONOM为时间依赖偏微分方程提供了高效且灵活的建模方法，尤其在超分辨率场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

Motivation: 离线强化学习通常需要显式奖励标注，但标注成本高或难以获取。ReLOAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用随机网络蒸馏（RND）生成内在奖励，通过专家状态转移训练预测网络，预测误差作为奖励信号。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，ReLOAD表现与传统奖励标注方法相当。

Conclusion: ReLOAD提供了一种简单有效的离线强化学习奖励标注替代方案。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

Conclusion: 研究加深了对GD训练动态的理解。

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

Motivation: 现有DCT方法主要针对离散一维空间，难以处理复杂数据（如图像）。MMD虽能衡量复杂分布差异，但在多分布对评估中信息不足。

Method: 提出NAMMD，通过RKHS范数缩放MMD值，设计NAMMD-based DCT方法，并分析其渐近分布。

Result: 理论证明NAMMD-based DCT比MMD-based DCT具有更高的检验力，实验验证其在多种数据上的有效性。

Conclusion: NAMMD-based DCT在理论和实验中均优于MMD-based DCT，且适用于两样本检验问题。

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: 证明CSI扰动具有生物特征编码潜力，低成本Wi-Fi硬件可用于无源、无设备的人体识别。

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

Result: iw-SFT在语言模型和连续控制任务中表现优异，例如在AIME 2024数据集上达到66.7%。

Conclusion: iw-SFT是一种简单有效的改进方法，性能接近高级RL算法。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，机器学习预测器的解释质量参差不齐，影响用户信任和决策。因此，需要一种机制拒绝无法合理解释的输入。

Method: 提出ULER框架，通过学习人类评分和特征相关性判断，设计拒绝器评估解释质量。

Result: ULER在多个基准测试和人类标注数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ULER能有效识别和拒绝低质量解释，提升用户对预测器的信任和决策质量。

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

*Jiadong Chen,Hengyu Ye,Fuxin Jiang,Xiao He,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Xiaofeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fremer是一种高效的工作负载预测模型，优于基于Transformer的模型，并在实际应用中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务中的工作负载预测对效率至关重要，但现有Transformer模型计算效率不足，且工作负载数据具有复杂周期性。

Method: Fremer在频域中处理周期性模式，满足高效、准确和鲁棒性需求。

Result: Fremer在多个指标上优于SOTA模型，并减少计算成本，实际测试中提升延迟和资源效率。

Conclusion: Fremer是一种高效且实用的工作负载预测解决方案。

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升解释的鲁棒性和可获取性。

Conclusion: 不确定性驱动的解释框架为复杂模型提供了更可靠的解释方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: DNA数据存储中的错误需要高效的重建算法。

Method: 预训练语言模型并微调以适应实际错误模式。

Result: TReconLM显著提高了无错误序列的恢复率。

Conclusion: TReconLM在痕迹重建中表现出色，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

TL;DR: 提出了两种改进DAPO算法的方法，通过混合策略视角提升训练稳定性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准策略梯度方法在稀疏奖励环境中存在不稳定和样本效率低的问题。

Method: 1. 引入预训练的稳定引导策略提供离策略经验；2. 重新利用零奖励样本。

Result: 理论分析表明目标函数收敛到最优解，平衡了探索与利用。

Conclusion: 混合策略框架实现了更稳定和高效的政策优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Motivation: 现有MCMC加速方案在硬件灵活性或系统级效率上存在不足，限制了其在大规模问题中的应用。

Method: MC$^2$A通过扩展处理器性能模型、设计参数化硬件加速器架构，并引入新型Gumbel采样器，优化MCMC加速。

Conclusion: MC$^2$A证明了通用硬件加速的可行性，有助于推广MCMC解决方案在多样化应用领域的普及。

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理链中初始错误传播导致最终结论不可靠的问题。

Method: 提出Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES)框架，采用归纳方法为每个推理步骤生成细粒度评分。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到72.1% Macro-F1（提升8.2点），在长推理链中表现优异（90.3% F1，提升27.6点）。

Conclusion: ARES能有效检测传播错误，提供统计保证，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Result: 发现多种临床相关概念，如医疗设备和病理特征，但操控模型行为的效果参差不齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了方法学挑战，但为理解MAIRA-2的内部概念提供了初步见解，推动了模型透明度的提升。

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Result: 实验表明该方法在MRGNN架构中具有潜力，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和初步实验验证了Fairing算法在图神经网络中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

Result: 在铁路轨道刚度估计案例中，模型显著优于现有方法，实现了高分辨率、自动化的健康评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为基础设施健康监测提供了准确、局部化和完全自动化的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Conclusion: FedGA通过动态调整和适时干预，有效提升了联邦学习的公平性，且不影响整体性能。

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分类法，用于解耦Transformer架构在长期时间序列预测中的设计，并通过实验验证了最佳架构选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在长期时间序列预测中表现优异，但架构设计多样且与时间序列特定设计紧密耦合，难以评估架构本身的影响。

Method: 提出了一种分类法，分离注意力机制、预测聚合、预测范式和归一化层等关键设计，并通过实验比较不同架构。

Result: 实验表明，双向注意力联合注意力最有效，更完整的预测聚合提升性能，直接映射范式优于自回归方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化架构选择，提出的组合模型优于现有模型，为未来Transformer架构设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

Motivation: 探索在已知图结构和标签集的情况下，学习图标记的能力。

Method: 考虑置换仅移动有限顶点的类，分析PAC可学习性与在线可学习性的关系。

Result: 证明了有限支持副本的PAC可学习性意味着G的完全同构类型的在线可学习性，且等价于自同构平凡性。还刻画了通过交换两个顶点诱导的副本不可学习的图。

Conclusion: 对于所有G和k>2，k顶点置换的可学习性与2顶点置换的可学习性等价，将无限图划分为四类，并确定了其复杂性。

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Conclusion: DASViT为ViT架构搜索提供了一种高效且创新的解决方案，展示了可微分搜索在ViT领域的潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Conclusion: MUPAX是一种通用、高效的XAI技术，为构建可解释和可信赖的AI系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

Method: 通过原型相似性模块对齐特征语义，并引入任务特定的蒸馏头解决标签不一致问题。

Result: 在公共多模态数据集上，优于单模态和多模态基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架在BCI应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Conclusion: NGTM为图生成提供了透明且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional
categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a
fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表示学习方法主要从模型学习角度出发，与RL任务不匹配，因此需要一种更直接与Bellman更新结构对齐的表示学习方法。

Result: 学习到的表示能够实现结构化探索，提升性能，尤其在困难探索和长时信用分配任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation为基于值的强化学习提供了一种理论支持且有效的表示学习路径。

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

Result: 实验表明mGradNets的结构偏置有助于学习最优传输映射，并在机器人群体控制问题中成功应用。

Conclusion: mGradNets为学习最优传输映射提供了有效方法，并在实际应用中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

Result: 在多种缺失场景下（如块缺失、点缺失、变采样率）展示了强大的域内和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoTM为适应性时间序列填补基础模型提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

Conclusion: 异步电价数据可显著提升预测精度，为欧洲互联电力市场的竞价策略优化提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的排列空间贝叶斯优化方法依赖于Mallows核，其复杂度为Ω(n²)，效率较低。

Method: 通过排序算法框架生成核函数，提出Merge Kernel（基于归并排序），并加入三种轻量级描述符以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，Merge Kernel在多个排列优化基准测试中优于Mallows核，提供了更紧凑且更有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: Merge Kernel为排列空间的贝叶斯优化提供了更高效且紧凑的核函数选择。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

Conclusion: TRENN和MT-TRENN适用于高风险协作环境中的人本AI应用，如智能决策支持系统。

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative

functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

### [152] [Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338)
*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络对输入和权重扰动的敏感性，提出了一种通过Lipschitz约束训练现代架构（如Transformer）的方法，并展示了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的敏感性可能导致对抗样本攻击、训练发散和过拟合等问题，因此需要研究如何通过Lipschitz约束提高模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 开发了计算高效的工具来维护范数约束的权重矩阵，并训练了带有Lipschitz约束的Transformer模型。优化器选择（如Muon）对性能有显著影响。

Result: 在Shakespeare文本上，2-Lipschitz Transformer达到60%验证准确率；在互联网文本上，145M参数的10-Lipschitz Transformer达到21%准确率。

Conclusion: Lipschitz约束可以在不依赖稳定性措施的情况下训练Transformer，但高准确率需要放宽Lipschitz约束。

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LiDAR特定效果（如传感器特性）上表现不足，需要更精确的模拟方法。

Method: 显式建模传感器特性（滚动快门、激光功率变化、强度衰减），并进行定量和定性比较及消融研究。

Result: 方法在LiDAR模拟准确性上优于现有技术，并展示了高级重模拟能力（如生成高分辨率LiDAR扫描）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LiDAR模拟的准确性，并具备高级重模拟能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（FMs）和世界模型（WMs）在任务泛化上各有优势，但缺乏整合方法。

Method: 学习映射函数将FM表示与WM状态空间结合，通过想象学习目标条件策略，并利用预测的时间距离作为奖励信号。

Result: 在多种多任务离线视觉控制基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂观察或领域差距场景中。

Conclusion: FOUNDER成功整合FMs和WMs，验证了学习奖励函数与真实奖励的一致性。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReAL-AD框架通过结合人类认知模型和视觉语言模型，提升了自动驾驶的规划准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定稀疏轨迹监督，无法模拟人类驾驶的层次推理过程。

Method: 提出三层认知模型（策略、决策、操作），结合VLMs增强推理能力。

Result: 规划准确性和安全性提升30%以上。

Conclusion: ReAL-AD使端到端自动驾驶更可解释且符合人类推理逻辑。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

Result: 在多样化任务中，VLMgineer设计的工具和策略比人工设计和VLM生成的设计更有效和创新。

Conclusion: VLMgineer展示了自动化工具设计的潜力，为未来研究提供了基准和代码支持。

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Conclusion: MoistureMapper在土壤湿度测量中高效且成本低，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

<details>

Result: 在多种地形和速度下验证了方法的泛化能力，展示了IMU和速度输入估计稳定性的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于农业和太空应用中的移动操作任务，并为基于感知的可通行性估计和规划提供了监督机制。

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

Motivation: 传统高性能视觉模型在资源受限的边缘计算设备上部署困难，且LiDAR无法检测地面障碍物（如电线）。

Method: 设计了轻量高效的ASCnet分割模型，采用MobileNetV2作为主干网络，结合ASCSPP模块提取DLO特征，并引入滑动窗口（SW）后处理模块去噪。

Result: 在自建数据集上达到75.3%的Miou，边缘设备上推理速度为9.3 FPS，优于现有DLO检测模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和性能间取得平衡，成功在物理机器人平台上验证。

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

Result: 优化步态参数能显著降低能量消耗，提升四足机器人的整体效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为四足机器人提供了节能控制策略，可直接应用于商业平台。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，新方法在静态物体检索和动态/未映射物体查询中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法通过结合环境上下文和LLM语义先验，显著提高了动态或未映射物体导航的成功率。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at

Conclusion: 结构化记忆系统有效解决了长期EQA任务中的记忆与探索权衡问题，为机器人长期操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证了方法的有效性，减少了工程需求并提前评估幻觉。

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE方法显著降低了对LLMs和工程设计的依赖，提升了任务执行的可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

Result: 实验表明方法提升OOD条件下的情境感知和决策能力。

Conclusion: LaViPlan为自动驾驶VLM代理提供了一种有效的后训练范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在运动规划中表现优异，但无法直接优化不可微目标（如碰撞避免和目标达成）。

Result: 在行人数据集（CrowdNav, ETH-UCY）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在安全有效的运动规划中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂动态环境中，传感器性能退化直接影响AI推理，传统方法难以全面覆盖所有退化场景。

Method: 整合相机噪声因素识别与情境覆盖分析，结合领域、传感器和安全专家知识，扩展退化模型。

Result: 提出了一种支持鲁棒性需求系统化提取和完整性评估的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为相机退化场景下AI感知系统的鲁棒性需求提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

Result: 发现性能显著下降，原因包括机器人观测空间有限、环境光照变化和物理挑战。

Conclusion: VLN-PE为改进跨体现适应性提供了新途径，并启发社区重新思考VLN的局限性。

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作，构建更适应人机交互发展的信任理解框架。

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设环境已知，但实际环境可能未知或时变，且高斯过程在大数据集上实时性能不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于长时间任务，提升了实时性能。

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型预测控制（MPC）在实时系统（如机器人）中因计算负担而限制应用的问题，尤其是短预测时域对控制性能和长期目标设计的负面影响。

Method: 利用可微分MPC和神经网络传播模仿损失的梯度，学习压缩且上下文相关的成本函数。

Result: 在仿真和真实自动驾驶赛车实验中，ZipMPC表现优于基线方法，尤其在长期目标优化、计算效率、约束满足和泛化能力方面。

Conclusion: ZipMPC通过模仿长时域MPC行为，显著提升了短时域MPC的性能，适用于未训练环境，且计算成本低。

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

Conclusion: GraspGen展示了强大的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式脑电反馈的强化学习框架（RLIHF），用于解决稀疏奖励下的策略学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在稀疏奖励条件下效果不佳，且依赖人工设计的复杂奖励函数。RLHF虽引入人类反馈，但显式反馈机制（如按钮或标签）会干扰自然交互并增加用户认知负担。

Method: 利用非侵入性脑电信号（EEG）中的错误相关电位（ErrPs）提供连续隐式反馈，通过预训练解码器将EEG信号转化为概率奖励组件。

Result: 在MuJoCo模拟环境中，使用Kinova Gen2机械臂完成复杂抓取任务，结果显示基于EEG反馈的策略性能接近人工设计的密集奖励策略。

Conclusion: 隐式神经反馈为交互式机器人中可扩展且人类对齐的强化学习提供了潜力。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Conclusion: 机器人通过迁移预训练策略中的工具-环境接触识别能力学习新技能，多模态传感器提升了接触状态和环境几何的识别。

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory

STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in

simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired

robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex

  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three

Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep

median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.
