To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09Mono-InternVL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540e\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672cMono-InternVL-1.5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cdelta\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Mono-InternVL\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7248Mono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u521b\u65b0\u7684Endogenous Visual Pre-training\uff08EViP\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Mono-InternVL\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d12\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions.

Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first\nprobe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then\nprobe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them.

Traditional physics-based stability metrics,\nsuch as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require\nknowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise\ncenter-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field\nconditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate\nrobot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight\nneural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot\nstability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.\n  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a\nscalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score\ncaptures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical\ninstability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based\nmodel. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across\nmultiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously\nunseen conditions.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation.

We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates\na long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent\ncost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed\nmethod in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC\nconsistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times\nclose to the long-horizon MPC baseline.

While Transformer-based\narchitectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence\nlength hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements\nin State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for\nlong-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and\ntransient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise\nissues in time series.

First, we use optic\nflow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model\n(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of\nrobot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6216\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f53\u73b0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0830\u6b21\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534750%\uff0c50\u6b21\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534720%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios.

We show that it is easy to\nimplement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.\nThe resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for\nlarge language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.\nFor example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5iw-SFT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u4f18\u5316RL\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfSFT\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4ee5\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1RL\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08iw-SFT\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316RL\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "iw-SFT\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728AIME 2024\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523066.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "iw-SFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u9ad8\u7ea7RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features.

Owing to\nCLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing\ninterest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on\ntask-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting\nin suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,\nwe propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and\nEnsemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the\nattention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

Recognizing the\nimportance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the\nWaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor\nutilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting\nvibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early\nnetwork layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network\neffectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement\nspeeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal\ndependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors\nfor health condition estimation.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations.

That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT\nin low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks.

Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial\nlandmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and\nstruggle to capture subtle emotions.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an\nexpression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations\nto capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to\nrender fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked\ncross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression\ngeneration, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in\nthis area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are\nspecifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating\nmulti-character portrait animations.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics\nthrough a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific\ndistillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion\nregression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and\nmultimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset.

This paper introduces a registration-based\nanomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with\ncluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.\nSpecifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal\nprototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a\nlocal level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is\ncomputed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each\ncluster.

In this work, we\nobserve an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within\nany weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent\nin the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality\nimplies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,\nsignifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the\nfine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as\nthe pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of\nfine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an\nApproximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the\nlow-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to\ngenerate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the\ndown/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices\nwith those of the backbone.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings.
