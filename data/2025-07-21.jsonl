However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly\nchallenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and\nthe cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical\nto prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on\nstacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to\nguarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a\nsystematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in\ncompliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a\nsingle pair of compact hard-stop surfaces.

However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates\nthat SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an\nevolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy."}

Short\n  paper manuscript submitted to TAROS 2025", "summary": "The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been\nwell-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation\nis possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task\ninstances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach\nposes new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the\nperformance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of\nrobots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully\ncompact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask\nself-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into\ndifferent compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our\nmultitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a\ncompact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation\ntrials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of\nrobots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation\nbehavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the\nproportion of clustered robots found in other studies."}

To better understand the value of using other\ninput modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we\ngenerate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional\ngeographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and\nsegmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional\ngeographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model\nperformance.

Running a Transformer\nautoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,\nmore recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback\nloops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in\nsubsequent steps. While this \"thinking aloud\" mirrors human reasoning,\nbiological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as\nlanguage. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty.

First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion\n(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines\nstandard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy\ninput from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative\nand compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and\nstructure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity\nscaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders\ninserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference\ntime. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during\ntraining further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these\ncontributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion\nmodels, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,\nin-context generative diffusion architectures."}

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry).

Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these\nquasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected\nobjects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The\nT-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost.

Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks.

We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads\nthat control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the\nmodel towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs.

However, we\nfind that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to\nVision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily\nbecause Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most\ntoken reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance\nmeasurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token\nimportance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further\npropose MTR, a training-free \\textbf{M}amba \\textbf{T}oken \\textbf{R}eduction\nframework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our\nmethod can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various\nMamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\nreduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across\nvarious tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by\napproximately 40\\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\\% drop in ImageNet\nperformance without retraining."}

The emergence of foundation models\n(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by\noffering rich, transferable representations.

In\nthis paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale\nskin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We\npropose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and\na lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,\nreplay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of\nfrozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers\nwith prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve\ncompetitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for\ncontinual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real\nworld medical applications.
