Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Le-Anh Tran,Chung Nguyen Tran,Ngoc-Luu Nguyen,Nhan Cach Dang,Jordi Carrabina,David Castells-Rufas,Minh Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDNIG是一种基于U-Net架构的新型深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强，通过亮度引导和多尺度特征提取提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强中未曝光区域处理不足的问题，提升模型对不同光照条件的适应性。

Method: 结合U-Net架构和亮度图（来自BCP），引入SPP模块提取多尺度特征，使用Swish激活函数，并在GAN框架中优化。

Result: 在定量指标和视觉质量上优于现有方法，同时模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG适用于实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is
available at https://github.com/tranleanh/ednig.

### [3] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的表现，发现即使顶尖模型也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要多区域推理的复杂视觉任务中的能力。

Method: 设计三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索、平滑视觉搜索）进行评估。

Result: 旗舰模型在这些任务中表现差，仅略高于随机准确率。

Conclusion: 当前模型在核心视觉推理能力上仍有欠缺。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

### [4] [Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13362)
*Binbin Ji,Siddharth Agrawal,Qiance Tang,Yvonne Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同提示策略对空间推理的影响，并探索如何通过强化学习提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用SceneGraph CoT提示和Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）进行微调，对比监督微调（SFT）。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估中表现更优，且在OOD条件下更稳健。

Conclusion: 强化学习和结构化提示能有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化性。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

TL;DR: 利用2D视觉语言模型进行开放词汇3D物体检测，无需人工标注3D标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D物体检测数据集类别有限和标注成本高的问题，利用2D模型的语义理解能力扩展至开放世界场景。

Method: 通过2D视觉语言检测器生成文本条件提案，结合SAM分割和相机几何投影到3D空间，引入几何膨胀策略推断3D边界框。

Result: 在LiDAR和RGB-D输入下均取得竞争性定位性能，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Conclusion: 提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练方法在多模态场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

*Xiaojian Lin,Wenxin Zhang,Yuchu Jiang,Wangyu Wu,Yiran Guo,Kangxu Wang,Zongzheng Zhang,Guijin Wang,Lei Jin,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Butter是一个新颖的目标检测框架，通过增强层次特征表示来提高检测鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和计算效率之间存在平衡问题，Butter旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: Butter引入了频率自适应特征一致性增强（FAFCE）组件和渐进层次特征融合网络（PHFFNet）模块，以优化特征表示。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上的实验表明，Butter在检测精度和模型复杂度方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化，在自动驾驶场景中实现了准确性、可部署性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving
community.

TL;DR: ModaRoute是一种基于LLM的智能路由系统，通过动态选择最优模态提升多模态视频检索效率，减少计算开销并保持高召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集文本标注方法虽能达到较高召回率，但离线处理成本高且会遗漏关键视觉信息（如场景文本）。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图并预测信息需求，动态路由查询至ASR、OCR或视觉索引，减少模态搜索数量。

Result: 在180万视频片段上测试，计算开销降低41%，平均每查询使用1.78种模态（原需3种），召回率达60.9%。

Conclusion: 智能路由为多模态检索系统提供了实用解决方案，在降低基础设施成本的同时保持竞争力。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Result: 开放集检测技术逐渐成为主流，减少了缺陷标注的需求，并能识别新异常。

Conclusion: 该综述提供了工业缺陷检测领域的全面视角，强调了开放集技术的崛起和未来趋势。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

### [12] [Using Multiple Input Modalities Can Improve Data-Efficiency and O.O.D. Generalization for ML with Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13385)
*Arjun Rao,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在卫星图像机器学习（SatML）任务中，结合其他地理数据层与光学图像能显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域场景下效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SatML模型主要依赖光学图像输入，研究旨在评估其他地理数据层对模型性能的潜在价值。

Method: 通过为SatML基准任务生成增强数据集，将额外地理数据层与光学图像结合，测试分类、回归和分割任务中的表现。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域场景下；硬编码融合策略优于学习型策略。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML模型的数据效率和泛化能力有重要价值，硬编码融合策略值得未来研究关注。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Result: 在先进流匹配模型上验证，该方法能稳定擦除概念且不降低模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 为开发更安全、负责任的生成模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义占用预测需要昂贵的LiDAR标注数据，而二进制占用数据成本较低但未被充分利用。研究旨在探索如何利用二进制数据提升语义预测。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在预训练和自动标注任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用二进制数据，显著提升了3D语义占用预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型InSyn，用于行人轨迹预测，通过显式捕捉多样化的交互模式和改进训练策略SSOS，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖相对位置建模行人交互，忽略了特定交互模式（如配对行走或冲突行为），导致在拥挤场景中预测精度受限。

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上表现优于基线模型，尤其在拥挤场景中；SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn模型和SSOS策略有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在复杂交互场景中。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用、上下文生成架构中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建更全面的 drowsiness 数据集，捕捉生理、行为和驾驶相关信号。

Method: 使用深度相机、IR 相机、生物信号传感器等采集数据，结合模拟驾驶环境。

Result: 数据集包含 19 名受试者的 1,400 分钟连续数据，记录逐渐变化的 drowsiness 状态。

Conclusion: 该数据集为 drowsiness 研究提供了更全面的多模态数据支持。

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AortaDiff是一种基于扩散的框架，直接从CT/MRI体积生成平滑的主动脉表面，适用于CFD分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动干预，难以生成几何一致且适合CFD分析的表面。

Method: AortaDiff使用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，包括动脉瘤或缩窄病例。

Conclusion: AortaDiff是一种端到端解决方案，适用于心血管研究，能生成高质量可视化和CFD兼容网格。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

TL;DR: Depth3DLane提出了一种双路径框架，结合自监督深度估计，无需昂贵传感器或深度数据，实现了单目3D车道检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵传感器或深度数据，且需要已知相机参数，限制了在无校准场景中的应用。

Method: 采用双路径框架，结合自监督深度网络生成点云，并通过3D车道锚点采样特征推断几何。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上表现优异，且无需相机校准即可应用。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane在无传感器和校准的场景中实现了高效3D车道检测。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

TL;DR: COREVQA是一个新的视觉蕴含基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在拥挤场景中的推理能力，结果显示现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少评估视觉语言模型在视觉蕴含任务（如基于图像接受或反驳假设）上的能力。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608张图像和合成的真/假陈述对，图像来自CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 即使表现最好的模型准确率也低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在拥挤场景中的视觉蕴含推理能力存在显著不足。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI和合成媒体的快速发展，区分AI生成图像与真实图像变得至关重要，传统水印技术易受对抗攻击。

Method: IConMark通过嵌入有意义的语义属性，使水印对人类可解释且抗对抗操作，同时支持手动验证。

Result: IConMark及其变体（+SS和+TM）在水印检测的AUROC得分上分别比最佳基线高出10.8%、14.5%和15.9%。

Conclusion: IConMark为可解释水印技术提供了有效解决方案，并能与现有水印技术结合以进一步增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Result: NMW集成方法达到95.5%的准确率和0.9610的F1分数，优于单个模型。

Conclusion: 集成AI系统能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断工作流，但仅限于二元骨折检测。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU超过85%，整体准确率达90%），并新发现4处考古遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合历史影像能有效发现已消失的考古遗址，为考古研究提供新突破。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Motivation: 当前方法在建模复杂时空依赖和人类驾驶行为不可预测性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出CaSTFormer，包含RSF机制、CPE模块和FSN网络，分别用于特征对齐、消除虚假相关和特征合成。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer能有效捕捉复杂因果时空依赖，提升预测准确性和透明度。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Conclusion: PhyWorldBench为视频生成模型的物理模拟能力提供了系统评估，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

Motivation: 摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，需要一种鲁棒的方法。

Method: 通过自校准方法，利用可靠的多视角点回归视差不确定性，结合MVS阶段的相关线索。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为摄影测量点云提供了鲁棒且可验证的不确定性量化，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data has proven effective for agricultural

features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with
acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream
clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress
detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Result: 相比传统方法，采集时间减少11倍，且预测结果与高分辨率数据相似。

Conclusion: SparseC-AFM为二维材料的工业应用提供了高效的AI辅助表征方法。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that

By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our

integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline

Conclusion: 通过LoRA适配生成器能有效提升视觉语言模型在持续学习中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF有效解决了噪声点云下的表面重建问题，为3D神经场提供了一种新的去噪方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的无监督图像去模糊方法，通过纹理先验学习和自适应滤波提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取大量真实的模糊-清晰图像对困难且昂贵，研究无配对数据的去模糊方法更实用。现有方法依赖对抗学习，忽略了真实模糊的复杂性。

Method: 提出DM框架，结合纹理先验编码器（TPE）和纹理转移变换层（TTformer），利用自适应滤波和小波对抗损失。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有确定性方法生成的SR图像模糊且感知质量差，希望通过扩散模型生成更清晰的高保真SR图像。

Method: 结合高阶ODE的随机采样器和知识蒸馏的一步扩散，提升扩散模型效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将运行时间降至基线的1.6%，同时保持图像失真和感知质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效生成高质量SR图像方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式推理能力，需要结构化标注支持逐步推理。

Method: 提出CoTasks框架，将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取等四个基础任务，嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型推理性能显著提升，部分子类别提升高达48.1分。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为结构化链式推理监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS能有效处理复杂场景、旋转相机运动和平行运动，性能优越。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EPSilon提出了一种高效的混合3D头像生成方法，通过空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO）策略减少计算成本，显著提升训练和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和SMPL的混合模型因变形方案计算成本高导致推理速度慢，EPSilon旨在通过高效采样策略解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ERO和EIO两种采样策略，分别省略空射线和空区间，减少无效采样点，同时采用单阶段NeRF结构。

Result: EPSilon仅使用3.9%的采样点，推理速度提升约20倍，训练收敛速度提升4倍，且保持生成质量。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合3D头像生成的效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Result: 在EvReID和MARS数据集上验证了RGB-Event行人重识别框架的有效性。

Conclusion: EvReID数据集和TriPro-ReID框架为未来研究提供了数据和基准支持。

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Conclusion: PW-FNet通过结合小波和傅里叶变换，实现了高效且高质量的图像恢复，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

Method: 提出区域特定掩码比率分配和骨架驱动的手部掩码引导，结合掩码SDF驱动的多模态学习机制。

Result: 实验表明，MaskHOI显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒的特征学习，有效提升了3D手-物体交互姿态估计的精度。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，并在CVPR 2025 DriveX挑战赛中取得第一。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Conclusion: 该方法在结构健康监测中具有高精度和鲁棒性，适用于不同测试样本。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Conclusion: 新准度量为MOT算法评估提供了更灵活的工具，尤其适用于需要不对称惩罚的场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，提升了信息捕捉能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

TL;DR: Diffusion-FSCIL利用冻结的文本到图像扩散模型解决少样本类增量学习问题，通过多尺度特征提取和潜在重放提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）面临数据稀缺和灾难性遗忘的挑战，需利用生成模型的优势。

Method: 采用冻结的扩散模型作为主干，提取多尺度特征并辅以特征蒸馏，减少训练组件。

Result: 在CUB-200、miniImageNet和CIFAR-100上表现优于现有方法，有效保留旧类性能并适应新类。

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL通过生成模型的多尺度表示和高效设计，显著提升了FSCIL的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Motivation: 现有T2V模型在图像质量和运动表现上存在不足，如闪烁和伪影。

Result: 实验显示EVS在图像和运动质量上优于现有方法，推理速度提升1.6x-4.5x。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的效果和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以准确捕捉HSI的高频细节，需要一种更有效的方法来提升重建质量。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习HSI的先验知识（SDP），并设计SPIM模块动态指导模型恢复HSI细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet方法上，性能提升约0.5 dB，优于现有网络。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM的结合有效提升了HSI重建的细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分类中，当需要可解释性和计算效率时，传统机器学习方法仍具优势。本文探索PE在图像中的应用，结合经典特征提取方法。

Method: 扩展PE至二维图像，结合HOG和LBP特征，生成780维特征集，用SVM分类器进行优化和评估。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，证明了PE与HOG、LBP结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像分类提供了轻量级、可解释的解决方案，展示了熵基描述符的潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Motivation: 现有研究主要通过重述问题解决模糊性，忽略了用户与视觉语言模型（VLMs）的交互性。缺乏评估交互澄清能力的基准，且VLMs倾向于回答而非提问。

Method: 提出ClearVQA基准，针对VQA中三类常见模糊性，涵盖多种VQA场景。

Result: ClearVQA为评估VLMs通过交互解决模糊性的能力提供了标准化工具。

Conclusion: ClearVQA填补了交互式澄清研究的空白，推动了VLMs在模糊性问题上的进步。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Conclusion: 显式引入可微分聚类模块是一种简单有效的策略，能够显著提升半监督学习和无监督领域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Conclusion: LoFNO能够去噪和时空上采样血流数据，实现更精确的脑血管诊断。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

Result: 在定量和定性评估中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore有效平衡了保真度和质量，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时序信息融合显著提升了遮挡推理和场景补全能力。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合系统在资源受限环境中效率低，模态对齐不充分，且对缺失数据敏感。

Method: 结合线性复杂度的Mamba模型和GRAM矩阵策略，引入自适应低秩层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，显著提升性能并减少参数训练量。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA在资源受限环境中实现了高效且鲁棒的多模态感知。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在16个数据集上平均性能提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性SSL策略，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)

An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments

all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant

mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise

framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in

Motivation: VLMs在处理复杂任务时，内部知识与外部信息可能冲突，导致幻觉和不可靠响应。研究旨在揭示这些冲突的解决机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位控制冲突的注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入。

Result: 研究发现少量注意力头控制冲突，修改这些头可引导模型行为，且其注意力定位优于梯度归因。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs解决跨模态冲突的机制，为模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual

Conclusion: 该方法在动态环境中有效提升了物体定位和关联的准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

Result: 在九个模型和四个任务中验证了框架的有效性，发现感知能力与预测性能强相关。

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对时间基础的视频理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

TL;DR: PCR-GS是一种无需COLMAP的3D高斯泼溅技术，通过相机姿态共正则化提升复杂轨迹下的场景建模和姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂相机轨迹下表现不佳，导致姿态估计和3D-GS联合优化陷入局部最优。

Method: 提出特征重投影正则化和基于小波的高频正则化，分别利用语义对齐和高频细节优化相机姿态。

Result: 实验表明PCR-GS在剧烈变化的相机轨迹下实现了优越的无姿态3D-GS场景建模。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过双重正则化机制有效解决了复杂相机轨迹带来的挑战。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子辅助网络的超轻量级EIT图像重建框架QuantEIT，显著降低了模型复杂性和参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT图像重建存在病态逆问题，传统深度学习方法参数多、效率低。

Method: 结合并行2量子比特电路生成潜在表示，并通过单线性层重建电导率。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上表现优于传统方法，仅用0.2%参数实现相当或更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: QuantEIT首次将量子电路引入EIT重建，无监督且无需训练数据，具有高效和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

TL;DR: 利用DepthAnything的深度先验增强LiDAR点云特征，提升3D目标检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云特征表达能力有限的问题，尤其是反射率属性的弱区分能力。

Method: 融合DepthAnything的深度先验与LiDAR属性，提出点级特征提取模块和双路径RoI特征提取框架，结合双向门控RoI特征融合模块。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中显著提升检测精度。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型的先验信息可有效提升LiDAR-based 3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量耗时且存在观察者间差异，因此需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究通过回顾性多中心评估，使用103张站立位全脊柱X光片，比较AI软件与两位放射科医生的测量结果。

Result: AI与放射科医生的测量误差较小（MAE约3.9度），相关性高（Pearson r约0.9），分类一致性中等（Cohen kappa 0.51-0.64）。

Conclusion: 该AI软件能够复现专家水平的测量结果，有望优化脊柱侧弯的临床工作流程。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种可泛化的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间渲染新视图，即使在输入视图较少的情况下也能实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，收集多视图数据成本高且效率低，而元宇宙等数字领域需要能够自然过渡昼夜的3D环境建模能力。当前NeRF技术在时间维度上的探索有限，缺乏专用数据集。

Method: 结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解耦策略，构建隐式内容辐射场，支持任意时间的神经辐射场建模，并通过体渲染合成新视图。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，并能平滑过渡不同时间，捕捉从黎明到黄昏的自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF展示了在少样本设置下高效渲染时间动态3D场景的潜力，为元宇宙等应用提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型训练需要大量高质量的三元组数据，但手动标注成本高且难以保证质量。缺乏可靠的自动化编辑质量评估方法限制了数据规模。

Method: 使用公共生成模型和任务调优的Gemini验证器，通过反转和组合引导扩大数据集规模，无需分割或基础模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动化标注步骤，实现了大规模高质量数据集的生成，推动了生成模型研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的视频分解方法存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，需要一种更有效的方法来显式分离静态和动态内容。

Method: DiViD使用序列编码器提取全局静态标记和逐帧动态标记，并通过条件DDPM解码器结合共享噪声计划、时变KL瓶颈和交叉注意力机制，实现静态-动态分解。

Result: DiViD在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有最高的交换联合准确率，同时保持静态保真度和动态传递性，并减少交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD通过显式静态-动态分解和创新的扩散模型设计，显著提升了视频分解的性能和效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the
collection and processing of sensitive personal data. In response, research has
increasingly focused on privacy-by-design solutions, raising the need for
objective techniques to evaluate privacy protection. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for evaluating visual privacy-protection methods across
three dimensions: privacy, utility, and practicality. In addition, it
introduces HR-VISPR, a publicly available human-centric dataset with biometric,
soft-biometric, and non-biometric labels to train an interpretable privacy
metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual
perception, while highlighting trade-offs between privacy, utility, and
practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解提供了高效解决方案，展示了VAR框架的潜力。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of

Motivation: 情绪驱动的图像编辑在创意产业中潜力巨大，但由于情绪的抽象性和多样性，精确操作仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型；3. 提出训练免费的Moodifier编辑模型。

Result: Moodifier在情绪准确性和内容保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将抽象情绪与具体视觉变化关联，为实际应用中的情绪内容创作提供了新可能。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking

TL;DR: Vision Mamba的MTR框架通过无训练方式实现高效token压缩，显著降低计算量且性能影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的token压缩技术，以扩展其应用范围，发现直接应用ViT的压缩方法会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出MTR框架，基于Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，无需训练即可实现token压缩。

Result: 实验显示MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、即插即用的token压缩方法，适用于多种Vision Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Result: 方法在类增量学习中达到SOTA性能，原型分类器也表现优异。

Conclusion: 冻结基础模型在皮肤病增量学习中具有强大潜力，适合实际医疗应用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法会破坏视觉-文本对齐，VLA-Mark旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标，动态平衡水印强度和语义保留。

Result: 实验显示VLA-Mark在PPL和BLEU上优于传统方法，检测准确率高达98.8%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark为质量保持的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

Motivation: 解决深度学习在监控视频异常检测中引发的隐私问题，评估匿名化技术对检测性能的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用四种匿名化技术（模糊、掩码、加密、虚拟替身），测试四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）。

Result: 匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）甚至能提升部分模型的AUC性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，并权衡了隐私保护与检测效用的关系，为隐私与检测需求的平衡提供了基准。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一个无需训练的多视角多目标关联框架，通过结合连接增量重叠图和极线几何，在3D重建中实现鲁棒的检测关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外观特征或几何约束，但在目标视觉相似或观测噪声时表现不佳。C-DOG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: C-DOG使用连接增量重叠图建模和极线几何，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差标准，提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于几何基线，并在高目标密度、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠等挑战下保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于现实场景中的可扩展3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有专有视觉基础模型（如DINOv2、CLIP等）缺乏透明度，且SSL聚类方法存在语义模糊问题。Franca旨在提供开源高性能模型，并改进聚类方法。

Result: Franca在多个下游任务中表现优异，性能超越专有模型，同时保持内存高效。

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能视觉模型设定了新标准，推动了可复现和通用基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性机构在精密应用中潜力巨大，但疲劳和机械故障的脆弱性阻碍了其实际应用。复杂和不确定的负载环境尤其需要机械硬停止来防止屈服和屈曲。

Method: 引入理论和实践框架，优化接触表面几何形状，最大化机构的多自由度工作空间，同时确保其保持在弹性范围内。

Conclusion: 为在不确定负载下工作的柔性系统提供了精密硬停止设计的基础，推动了柔性机构在实际系统中的应用。

Abstract: Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due
to their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent
vulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of
compliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly
challenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and
the cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical
to prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on
stacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to
guarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a
systematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in
compliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a
single pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a
theoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry
to maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that
the mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method
to a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and
provide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers
reliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling. This work
establishes a foundation for precision hard-stop design in compliant systems
operating under uncertain loads, which is a crucial step toward enabling the
application of compliant mechanisms in real-world systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots
has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered
conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user
intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether.
Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing
conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user
trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal
dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot
conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models
designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic
human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement
features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot
errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for
a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are
invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these
failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various
performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This
challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in
human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

Motivation: 解决进化算法在复杂输入空间下性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用DCT变换截取高能量特征，降低输入维度。

Result: 输入尺寸减少98%，学习效率提升20%。

Conclusion: SCOPE能显著压缩输入并提升控制器效能。

Abstract: Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning
method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these
algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space
becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the
solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more
complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input
matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce
the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of
the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using
SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a
matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are
then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the
addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.
SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series
pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of
compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension
is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates
that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an
evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.

Qualitatively, users with robotics experience preferred our controller, and the

Result: 仿真表明PE-PSO在轨迹质量、能效、避障和计算时间上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PE-PSO适用于复杂环境下的实时多无人机协同操作。

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic
environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the
need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with
premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory
planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve
swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to
dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using
B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization
complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent
framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with
distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.
The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized
control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining
real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across
several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle
avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and
applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex
environmental conditions.

Abstract: Secondary cataract is one of the most common complications of vision loss due
to the proliferation of residual lens materials that naturally grow on the lens
capsule after cataract surgery. A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a
surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule
and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic
system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a
standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe
on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time
tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system
enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with
in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still
current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate
effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five
experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square
errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was
performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and adaptive control framework for legged
robots that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a biologically
inspired torque library (TL), analogous to muscle memory. The proposed method
addresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory
tracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the
repetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the
framework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion
scenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based
model derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time
learning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A
central contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned
control profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and
gravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and
significantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the
bipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations
and hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework
reduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables
reliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope
traversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body
controllers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation
during execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of
existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating ILC
with torque memory as a highly data-efficient and practical solution for legged
locomotion in unstructured and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: SaWa-ML通过结合UWB和视觉惯性数据，实现了更鲁棒的多机器人定位。

Abstract: Multi-robot localization is a crucial task for implementing multi-robot
systems. Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot
localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless,
characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance
measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently
considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the
odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently,
long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable.
In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot
localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware
pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization.
Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range
error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions
between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing
long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose
correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and
evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving
scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While
automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models
require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the
output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a
distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the
validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep
this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting
original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual
augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet
the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting
real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing
the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic
design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high
performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert
evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user
intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created
manually.

model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a
neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data,
while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems play an increasingly vital role in a wide range of
applications, particularly for transport and delivery tasks in complex
environments. In airdrop missions, these platforms face the dual challenges of
abrupt control mode switching and inherent system delays along with control
errors. To address these issues, this paper presents an autonomous airdrop
system based on an aerial manipulator (AM). The introduction of additional
actuated degrees of freedom enables active compensation for UAV tracking
errors. By imposing smooth and continuous constraints on the parabolic landing
point, the proposed approach generates aerial throwing trajectories that are
less sensitive to the timing of payload release. A hierarchical disturbance
compensation strategy is incorporated into the Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (NMPC) framework to mitigate the effects of sudden changes in system
parameters, while the predictive capabilities of NMPC are further exploited to
improve the precision of aerial throwing. Both simulation and real-world
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves greater
agility and precision in airdrop missions.

Abstract: Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a significant challenge in
robotics. Despite substantial advancements, existing methods often face a
dilemma. Decentralized algorithms typically rely on predicting the behavior of
other agents, sharing contracts, or maintaining communication for safety, while
centralized approaches struggle with scalability and real-time decision-making.
To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability
Learning (HJR) for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning. Our method
provides scalable neural HJR modeling to tackle high-dimensional configuration
spaces and capture worst-case collision and safety constraints between agents.
We further propose a decentralized trajectory optimization framework that
incorporates the learned HJR solutions to solve MAMP tasks in real-time. We
demonstrate that our method is both scalable and data-efficient, enabling the
solution of MAMP problems in higher-dimensional scenarios with complex
collision constraints. Our approach generalizes across various dynamical
systems, including a 12-dimensional dual-arm setup, and outperforms a range of
state-of-the-art techniques in successfully addressing challenging MAMP tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been
well-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation
is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task
instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach
poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the
performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of
robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully
compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask
self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into
different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our
multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a
compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation
trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of
robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation
behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the
proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate
objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that
requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown
remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract
representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable
low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in
resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp
Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on
the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware
techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and
quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark
validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the
potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various
fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm
is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO
suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local
optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy
Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random
disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting
trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight
strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with
flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the
local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a
position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,
effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.
Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test
functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms
across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its
advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path
planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are
still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we
apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design
problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental
results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of
solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for
application.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

Abstract: The use of autonomous robots in space is an essential part of the "New Space"
commercial ecosystem of assembly and re-use of space hardware components in
Earth orbit and beyond. The STARFAB project aims to create a ground
demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable
commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous
robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the
condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB
facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile
Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it
can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot,
and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on
STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a
thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A
grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by
an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still
ongoing at the time of writing. This paper details the concept of operations
for the MIM as an on-orbit autonomous inspection and maintenance system, the
mechanical and electronic design of the MIM, and the sensors package used for
non-destructive testing.

Result: MorphIt在多个指标上优于基线方法，实现了更少的球体和更低计算开销的网格近似。

Conclusion: 通过动态适应几何表示，机器人能更好地利用物理形态作为主动资源，提升在复杂环境中的操作能力。

Abstract: What if a robot could rethink its own morphological representation to better
meet the demands of diverse tasks? Most robotic systems today treat their
physical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing
the same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly
different computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a
novel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives
that balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or
inflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic
gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides
explicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline
approaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis
Approximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation
with fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show
enhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich
interaction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically
adapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit
their physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible
parameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where
physical form must continuously balance precision with computational
tractability.

Abstract: Autonomous motion planning is critical for efficient and safe underwater
manipulation in dynamic marine environments. Current motion planning methods
often fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to
real-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we
introduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a
Heuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning
for autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic
Roadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite
cost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and
execution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the
search space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time
planning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update
uncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental
conditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through
extensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages
of our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness. This
probabilistic approach significantly advances the capability of autonomous
underwater robots, ensuring optimized motion planning in the face of dynamic
marine challenges.

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

Motivation: 传统的数据归一化方法（如均值标准差或固定范围缩放）在机器学习中常见，但Copula理论中的CDF归一化方法在金融领域流行，却鲜少在机器学习中应用。作者希望展示其在KANs中的优势。

Method: 通过将Legendre-KAN中的缩放方法替换为CDF归一化，并利用HCR解释神经元权重为混合矩，实现局部联合分布建模和概率分布传播。

Result: CDF归一化在KANs中显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: CDF归一化是一种有效的替代方法，能够简化表示并减少过拟合，同时支持概率分布传播和方向调整。

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a
fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization
to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF
(cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1],
allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems
nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some
its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs), improving predictions from Legendre-KAN by just switching rescaling to
CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons
are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate
also probability distributions, and change propagation direction.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多源数据的复杂系统，具有可扩展性和资源效率。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to
automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on
manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to
input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions
and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.
Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies
either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study
introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates
short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.
Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics
human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance
generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted
using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method
consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning
architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves
particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering
a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in
healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多保真度数据驱动学习中的认知不确定性和数据噪声分离问题，以提升模型在科学和工程领域的适用性。

Method: 采用层次化方法，从单保真度确定性神经网络扩展到多保真度方差估计贝叶斯循环神经网络。

Result: 方法能够准确预测响应、量化模型误差，并在存在噪声时发现噪声分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学和工程领域的不确定性设计和分析提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method
accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also
discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for
future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains;
especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under
uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信念函数的聚类算法Soft-ECM，适用于混合数据和时间序列等复杂数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于信念函数的聚类算法无法处理混合数据或非表格数据（如时间序列），因为这些数据通常不在欧几里得空间中表示。

Method: 重新定义了Evidential C-Means (ECM)问题，提出Soft-ECM算法，仅需半度量即可定位不精确簇的质心。

Result: 实验表明，Soft-ECM在数值数据上与模糊聚类方法效果相当，并能处理混合数据，结合DTW等半度量对时间序列数据有益。

Conclusion: Soft-ECM扩展了信念函数聚类的应用范围，适用于复杂数据类型。

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的可解释框架，用于实时评估空中交通管制员（ATCO）的任务需求，优于现有启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂性指标难以捕捉空中交通的细微操作驱动因素，需要更精确的工具来评估任务需求。

Method: 采用注意力机制的GNN模型，通过静态交通场景中的交互预测即将发布的指令数量，并通过系统消融飞机来生成可解释的任务需求评分。

Result: 该框架显著优于启发式方法，并能更可靠地评估场景复杂性，还能将任务需求归因于特定飞机。

Conclusion: 该工具为控制器培训和空域重新设计提供了新的复杂性分析方式。

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有HAR方法依赖特定应用标签、泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在不同环境或人群中的数据。

Method: 采用跨模态自监督预训练方法，利用IMU-视频数据学习通用表示。

Result: 在零样本和少样本评估中，该方法优于当前最先进的IMU-视频预训练和仅IMU预训练方法。

Conclusion: 跨模态预训练是学习通用数据表示的有效工具，尤其在动态数据模态（如IMU信号）中。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出模型基代理作为模型无关强化学习的替代方案，以解决样本效率低、学习不安全及可解释性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代自主系统需要高效、安全且可解释的决策代理，而模型无关强化学习依赖深度神经网络，存在样本效率低、学习不安全及可解释性差的缺陷。

Method: 引入模型基代理（如模型预测控制），利用系统动力学、成本和约束的可适应模型进行安全策略学习，并结合模型无关强化学习弥补模型失配。

Result: 模型基代理能够通过编码先验知识来约束和解释决策，同时结合模型无关强化学习提升样本效率和安全性。

Conclusion: 模型基代理与模型无关强化学习的结合为高效、安全且可解释的决策代理学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty
has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across
fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled
decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system
interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL
has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function
approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's
policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify
the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited
interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces
model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy
approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and
constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system
knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,
while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We
outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --
exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning
approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,
along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been
established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored,
motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient
learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

The task is to distinguish between the proper output from LLM and the output
generated under malicious modification of the LLM. As this problem was not
extensively researched, participants are required to develop new techniques to
address this issue or adjust already existing ones to this problem's statement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个双收敛的统一框架，解释了LLMs如何通过上下文学习（ICL）从输入序列中学习新行为，而无需参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何通过ICL超越预训练阶段学到的原始含义，并揭示其内部机制。

Method: 引入双收敛框架，分析隐藏表示在上下文和层间的收敛过程，证明其对低频表示的隐式偏好。

Result: 理论解释了ICL的鲁棒性、表示几何的全局结构性和局部扭曲性，以及能量衰减现象。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL的机制提供了新见解，并为更广泛的数据分布和设置下的研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new
behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent
studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in
pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating
process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the
mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we
present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a
unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge
both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to
an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove
analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical
observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured
but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without
vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness
towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results
provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical
foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data
distributions and settings.

*Beka Begiashvili,Carlos J. Fernandez-Candel,Matías Pérez Paredes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型AI衍生的超声心动图参数Acoustic Index，用于量化心脏功能障碍，结合了Koopman算子理论和混合神经网络，在736名患者中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数如EF和GLS在早期检测心脏功能障碍时存在局限性，需要可重复、可解释且操作独立的参数。

Method: 结合EDMD和混合神经网络，提取时空动态并融合临床数据，生成0-1的连续风险评分。

Result: 在独立测试集中AUC为0.89，交叉验证显示敏感性和特异性均超过0.8。

Conclusion: Acoustic Index是一种物理驱动的可解释AI生物标志物，有望用于早期检测和监测。

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种指标（谱可预测性评分和最大Lyapunov指数）来量化时间序列的可预测性，避免传统模型评估的事后性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型评估指标在模型开发后才评估性能，无法提前了解数据的可预测性。本文旨在通过两种指标提前评估时间序列的固有可预测性。

Method: 使用谱可预测性评分评估时间序列的频率成分强度和规律性，Lyapunov指数量化数据生成系统的混沌性和稳定性。在合成和真实数据集（M5预测竞赛）上验证。

Result: 两种指标能准确反映时间序列的固有可预测性，并与多种模型的实际预测性能强相关。

Conclusion: 提前了解时间序列的可预测性有助于优化资源分配，对可预测性差的产品采取替代策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

TL;DR: SELF-Transformer通过内部迭代更新注意力权重，提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，无需依赖自回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，避免依赖外部化的中间状态（如自回归）。

Method: 引入SELF-Transformer，通过迭代更新注意力权重至固定点，适应输入难度。

Result: 在编码器基准测试中准确率提升高达20%，且不增加参数量。

Conclusion: SELF-Transformer在保持编码器架构简洁的同时，显著提升了表达能力。

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that
power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a

innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and
ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts
PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse

are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via
responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,
then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional

benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model
match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,
constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to
integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements
in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的离线策略评估方法DiPS和DPR，用于匹配市场中的推荐系统，解决了传统方法在双向交互和大规模数据下的不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配市场中的双向交互和大规模数据导致传统离线策略评估方法存在方差问题和奖励稀疏性，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 结合直接方法（DM）、逆倾向得分（IPS）和双重稳健（DR）估计器，并引入中间标签（如初始参与信号）以优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在合成数据和真实职位匹配平台的A/B测试日志中验证了DiPS和DPR的优越性。

Conclusion: DiPS和DPR在匹配市场的离线策略评估和学习任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of
services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating
applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new
policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and
impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays
a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only
offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike
conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature
of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and
exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address
these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel
OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for
matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM),
Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while
incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to
achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we
derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their
advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these
estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for
improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically
evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing
logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the
superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and
learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

Motivation: 解决GCN在大规模复杂图数据中过平滑和过压缩的问题，以及Graph Transformer在异构图数据中的性能限制。

Method: 结合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer，通过三通道增强模块和三学习机制实现全局与局部信息的融合。

Result: 在ACM、Reuters和USPS数据集上分别提升了0.87%、14.14%和7.58%的准确率。

Conclusion: Tri-GFN在异构图数据上表现优异，适用于新闻自动分类和主题检索等领域。

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made
significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges
such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale
and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.
Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,
its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To
address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework
that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the
Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the
differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a
unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The
framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components
are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes
the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust
clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning
among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to
capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations
for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the
Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding
performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news
classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

Motivation: 联邦学习中的通信开销是主要瓶颈，尤其是在带宽受限的移动和物联网设备应用中。

Method: 使用轻量级LSTM数字孪生预测客户端的梯度更新，仅在预测值超过阈值时请求通信，否则跳过轮次。

Result: 在非IID数据分布下，FedSkipTwin减少了12-15.5%的通信量，同时模型准确性提高了0.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 预测引导的跳过策略是带宽受限边缘环境中资源感知联邦学习的实用有效方法。

Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning
(FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with
constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel
client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins.
Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical
sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic
uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions,
requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold;
otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth.
Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients
under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin
reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously
improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the
standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided
skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in
bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection:
enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three
months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping
financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events
materialize. Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of
accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing
within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their
practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study
introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against
the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms
of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature
window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months

existing baselines.

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法显著提升了PI-GNNs在高密度问题中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过改进策略，PI-GNNs在高密度组合优化问题中的性能得到显著提升。

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

Method: 使用基于Pareto的MOBO策略（EHVI）与固定权重标量化基线（EI）进行对比，采用相同的高斯过程代理和分子表示。

Result: EHVI在Pareto前沿覆盖、收敛速度和化学多样性方面均优于标量化EI。

Conclusion: Pareto感知的获取策略在分子优化中具有实际优势，尤其在评估预算有限和权衡复杂时。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework
for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical
advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a
simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) --
against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement
(EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process
surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization
tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front
coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization
encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our
results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in
low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical
advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization,
especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

Conclusion: AST方法结合标记化效率和注意力机制的表达能力，实现了准确且可扩展的模拟结果。

Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like
material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods
with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical
systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body
interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have
to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical
for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from
geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)
method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the
simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this
structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then
apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,
fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.
Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens
in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and
the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable
simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable
body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations
with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by
computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale
dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support
future research in this area.

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under
substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different
adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and
adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model
architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an
inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach
is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This
benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training
and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a
common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial
training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the
classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks
designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used
for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses
the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.
Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space
attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative
and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These
findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial
training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution
shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

Conclusion: SamGoG能有效解决双重不平衡问题，且兼容多种下游GNN，性能优越。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a
15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in
accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown
impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often
ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space.
However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing
more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to
adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore,
the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is
unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow
model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference
procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design,
demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to
baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based
generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for
model design.

Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it
presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently,
goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with
contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable
attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and
existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a
single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to
incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel
Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution
properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution
and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as
a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning,
which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning.
Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature
center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center
optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior
performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from
first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has
become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training
datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a
computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare
events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation
models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular
databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data
necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach
requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can
still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events
and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.
In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely
automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the
model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with
classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying
this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to
assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even
though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In
this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach
based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow
that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified
accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them
at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

Motivation: 现有神经因果模型多假设静态因果图，忽略了因果交互的动态性，因此需要一种新的理论框架来动态表示因果结构。

Method: 提出Causal Process框架，并实现Causal Process Model，将Transformer的注意力机制嵌入RL任务中，通过RL代理构建动态因果图假设。

Result: 在RL环境中，该方法在因果表示学习和代理性能上优于现有方法，并能恢复动态因果过程图。

Conclusion: Causal Process框架为动态因果结构表示提供了新思路，结合RL和注意力机制，实现了可解释的因果推断。

Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern
trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival
of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural
networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality
assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal
interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel
theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,
we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This
allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer
networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal
processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to
constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested
within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we
employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the
original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in
causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover
graphs of dynamic causal processes.

Conclusion: 将蛋白质表示为图像数据，为深度学习在生物分子模拟中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the
need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of
anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have
emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to
uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates
the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning
with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can
significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two
novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based
frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2)
encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on
real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our
proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies,
highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the
performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the
potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to
address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: 研究为楔形文字分类提供了首个自动分类结果，并建议改进数据采集标准以提升未来任务性能。

Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine
learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a
lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for
what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This
variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will
perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such
differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim
to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation
for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained
and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary
texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities
(Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is
ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for
signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are
the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

Conclusion: 图结构方法更适合大规模多站点SC协调，模型架构对性能至关重要。

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome
(SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for
neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and
generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have
acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging
consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -
such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate
these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or
overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a
site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across
diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a
simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this
framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected
autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a
top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight
prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior
preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as
reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although
the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly
modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world
multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our
results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization
performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly
well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in
large-scale multi-site SC studies.

Method: 提出动态加权机制ParallelTime Weighter和ParallelTime架构，根据输入和模型知识动态计算权重。

Result: ParallelTime在多个基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高且参数更少。

Conclusion: ParallelTime为时间序列预测中的并行Attention-Mamba架构提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two
architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural
language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window
attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing
long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to
both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to
long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we
propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates
interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token
based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the
ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter
mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.
Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer
parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly
outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for
future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The
implementation is readily available at:

Motivation: 先前研究发现基于对偶公式的动态规划方法在寻找静态CVaR最优策略时会失败，但原因不明。

Method: 通过将重点从策略优化转向策略评估，提出了两种最小化问题，并分析了风险分配一致性约束的作用。

Result: 发现约束条件不满足是导致评估错误的根源，并证明了对偶CVaR分解方法在寻找全局最优策略时的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CVaR评估中的根本限制，为未来方法设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding
static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when
based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained
unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization
to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the
static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization
problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency
constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of
the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation
errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then
demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR
DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.
We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the
search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR
decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single
policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

Conclusion: 该算法有效提升了在拜占庭故障存在时的学习准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for
Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated
GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively
learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents
exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial
behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local
predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global
model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the
cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused
GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of
the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy
improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR.
Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: DONUT为X射线科学中的实时分析提供了一种高效、无监督的解决方案。

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the
fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While
advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis
remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational
demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to
spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by
the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To
address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by
Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid
and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a
differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture,
DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time.
Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or
pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine
learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately
extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than
conventional fitting methods.

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于偏好的多目标强化学习方法（Pb-MORL），通过整合偏好来简化复杂的奖励设计，并证明了其理论有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标强化学习依赖预定义的奖励函数，难以平衡冲突目标且容易过度简化。偏好作为更灵活的决策指导，可以避免复杂的奖励设计。

Method: Pb-MORL通过构建与偏好对齐的多目标奖励模型，并证明优化该模型等同于训练帕累托最优策略。

Result: 在多个基准任务和实际应用中，Pb-MORL表现优异，甚至超过使用真实奖励函数的方法。

Conclusion: Pb-MORL展示了在复杂现实系统中应用的潜力，提供了一种更直观和灵活的多目标优化方法。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for
optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on
pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing
conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as
more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for
complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL
(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL
framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across
the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our
method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given
preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this
reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive
experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,
and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method
performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground
truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications
in complex real-world systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双过程多尺度心智理论框架（DPMT），用于提升人机协作中AI对人类复杂心理特征的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）代理在缺乏直接沟通时难以准确建模人类的领域意图等复杂心理特征，限制了人机协作的效果。

Method: 受认知科学双过程理论启发，提出DPMT框架，包含多尺度心智理论（ToM）模块，通过心理特征推理实现稳健的人类伙伴建模。

Result: 实验表明DPMT显著提升了人机协作效果，消融研究验证了多尺度ToM在慢系统中的贡献。

Conclusion: DPMT框架通过多尺度心智理论有效解决了人机协作中人类心理建模的挑战。

Abstract: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet
challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human
behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents
often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as
domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of
mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process
theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KANs在类别不平衡分类中表现优于MLPs，但计算成本高且与常规不平衡策略冲突，目前实用性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估KANs在类别不平衡分类中的表现，探索其与传统不平衡策略的兼容性。

Method: 使用十个基准数据集对KANs和MLPs进行实证比较，包括有无不平衡策略的情况。

Result: KANs在原始不平衡数据上表现更好，但与不平衡策略冲突且计算成本高；MLPs结合不平衡策略可达到类似效果。

Conclusion: KANs适用于资源充足的原始不平衡数据，但需进一步优化和理论支持以提高实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 理论证明算法收敛，实验在合成和真实数据（MIMIC-III）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CaRTeD填补了非规则张量分解理论空白，提升因果表示可解释性，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering
complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as
low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.
