The traditional\nregularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to\nmagnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes\nare likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost\nzero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a\nfilter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the\nprecise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model\nperformance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in\nan extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed\nCatalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with\ntheoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior\nachieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the\npruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world\neffectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm.\nPruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art\nfilter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and\nfair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning."}

In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to\nchallenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each\nfilter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe\nthe gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or\nnot, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used\nto construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel\nimportance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference.

The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also\nincorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a\ncredibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring\nrobust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead\nby 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving\nnear-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to\ntraditional softmax based DL models."}

DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion.

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a\nsemi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual\ncontrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for\ndistributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.\nIt enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and\nfacilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving\nmutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are\naggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to\nshare knowledge among clients.

In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets.

Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to\nlimited dexterity and actuation constraints.

If the wall available\nfor interaction is too large or too tall, the robot may still fail to grasp the\nobject even after pivoting, and the robot must combine different types of\nactions to grasp. To address this, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework.

The selected\nlow-level skill then samples a specific robot action in continuous space. To\nguide the robot to an appropriate location for executing the selected action,\nwe adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE).

This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting.

From this\nperspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a\nsingle-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token\nsimilarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise\nrelationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie\nin how the affinity matrix is defined and applied.

Four fully supervised models\n(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped\ndynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a\ncomprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a\ncustom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the\ntask. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at\nleast one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment\nin pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter\ncounts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4\nGPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more\nrigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or\nviscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically\npost-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,\nconstrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is\npioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous\nmonitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for\nautomated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service\nenvironments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future\ndirections for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce\ninstitutional food waste."}

Results\nshow these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very\nsparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with\ncompleteness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher\ncomputational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose\nestimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and\nlarge sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric\ncomplexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully\nreplace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,\nespecially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios."}

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

OpenBreastUS includes\n8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million\nfrequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a\ncomprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward\nsimulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,\nscalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and\nextensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing\ninnovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in\nreal-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate\nefficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers."}

PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and\nself-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes\neffectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting\nfull learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals\ncrucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the\nscalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective\nstrategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays\nthe basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of\nAL in both research and real-world applications.

Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions.

It enables a\ncomprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward\nsimulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,\nscalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and\nextensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing\ninnovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in\nreal-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate\nefficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers."}

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead.

This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors.

Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).

This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this\nperspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a\nsingle-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token\nsimilarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise\nrelationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie\nin how the affinity matrix is defined and applied.
