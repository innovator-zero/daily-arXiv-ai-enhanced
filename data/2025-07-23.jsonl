In this work, we propose a lightweight\nyet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to\npre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification\npipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with\na Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an\naccuracy of 96.67\\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the\nface verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,\nincluding a comfortable 99.7\\% reduction in the false rejection rate and\nenhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face\nverification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on\na real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV\nfootage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of\npoor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment\ntechniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework\nspecifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:\nvariations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent\nin practical surveillance scenarios."}

We empirically study the variability of reward model training on\nopen-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on\nthe same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting\nthe instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,\nwe demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause\noverfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this\nrisk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for\npreference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy\nregularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates.

This conventional process is labor-intensive,\ninaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements.\nHere, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework\nthat leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the\nmulti-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language\nmission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems\nthrough two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation,\nwhich parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code\nGeneration, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to\ngenerate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of\nnatural language mission specifications to support development and\nbenchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings\nshow that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from\nnatural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while\nsupporting generalization across mission types.

Single-image shadow\nremoval (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered\nby non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,\ntraditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details\nand maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and\nblurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall\nviewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,\napproaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize\nrestoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)\ndeep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve\nambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration\nvia a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive\ncomponent processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for\nconsistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for\nfine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent\nrestoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are\neffectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both\nconsistency and fidelity.
