### [1] [Salience Adjustment for Context-Based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15878)
*Bin Han,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于显著性调整的上下文感知情感识别框架，结合贝叶斯线索整合和视觉语言模型，动态加权面部和上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态社交场景中的情感识别需要理解面部表情与情境线索的复杂互动。

Method: 使用贝叶斯线索整合（BCI）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）动态调整面部和上下文信息的权重。

Result: 在囚徒困境场景中验证，显著性调整提高了情感识别性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究在更广泛社交场景和多模态应用中提供了方向。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts requires an understanding of
the complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. This
paper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion
recognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models
(VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the
expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations
and automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios,
which are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that
incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to
broader social contexts and multimodal applications.

*Goeric Huybrechts,Srikanth Ronanki,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Jack Fitzgerald,Srinivasan Veeravanallur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Document Haystack是一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）处理长文档能力的综合基准，包含400种文档变体和8,250个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理长文档方面缺乏合适的评估基准，因此需要构建一个全面的测试平台。

Method: 通过在不同深度的文档中插入纯文本或多模态文本+图像“针”来挑战VLMs的检索能力，并开发自动化评估框架。

Result: 提供了Document Haystack数据集的构建细节和特性，并展示了主流VLMs的测试结果。

Conclusion: Document Haystack填补了长文档处理评估的空白，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly
advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from
different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains
under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this,
we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is
supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the
construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present
results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this
area.

### [3] [PAT++: a cautionary tale about generative visual augmentation for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15888)
*Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira,Arathy Jeevan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 生成数据增强在细粒度视觉任务（如物体重识别）中的效果不佳，挑战了生成模型在此类任务中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成数据增强在物体重识别任务中的有效性，尤其是保留细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 提出PAT++，结合扩散自蒸馏与Part-Aware Transformer，并在Urban Elements ReID数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示性能下降，原因是域偏移和未能保留身份定义特征。

Conclusion: 生成模型在细粒度识别任务中的适用性有限，当前视觉增强方法存在关键局限性。

Abstract: Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.

### [4] [Local Dense Logit Relations for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15911)
*Liuchi Xu,Kang Liu,Jinshuai Liu,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的局部密集关系对数蒸馏方法（LDRLD），通过递归解耦和重组对数信息，捕捉类间关系，并结合自适应衰减权重策略（ADW）优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对数蒸馏方法未深入探索对数知识中的细粒度关系，限制了学生模型的学习效果。

Method: LDRLD通过递归解耦和重组对数信息捕捉类间关系，ADW策略动态调整关键类别对的权重，IRW和ERD分别用于权重分配和衰减控制。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-1K和Tiny-ImageNet等数据集上表现优于现有对数蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: LDRLD通过传递细粒度知识并强调关键关系，显著提升了学生模型的性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.

### [5] [An empirical study for the early detection of Mpox from skin lesion images using pretrained CNN models leveraging XAI technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15915)
*Mohammad Asifur Rahim,Muhammad Nazmul Arefin,Md. Mizanur Rahman,Md Ali Hossain,Ahmed Moustafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了预训练CNN模型（如InceptionV3和MobileNetV2）在猴痘早期检测中的有效性，并利用Grad-CAM增强模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 猴痘与其他皮肤病相似，早期诊断困难，AI尤其是深度学习在医学图像分析中潜力巨大，但相关研究较少。

Method: 使用MSLD和MSLD v2.0数据集，通过迁移学习微调预训练CNN模型，评估性能指标（如准确率、F1分数），并应用Grad-CAM可视化关键特征。

Result: InceptionV3在二分类数据集上准确率达95%，MobileNetV2在多分类数据集上达93%，Grad-CAM成功突出关键区域，但部分模型出现过拟合。

Conclusion: 预训练CNN模型和XAI技术在猴痘检测中具有潜力，未来需解决数据集限制、多模态数据整合及更多可解释性技术。

Abstract: Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency

### [6] [A Lightweight Face Quality Assessment Framework to Improve Face Verification Performance in Real-Time Screening Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15961)
*Ahmed Aman Ibrahim,Hamad Mansour Alawar,Abdulnasser Abbas Zehi,Ahmed Mohammad Alkendi,Bilal Shafi Ashfaq Ahmed Mirza,Shan Ullah,Ismail Lujain Jaleel,Hassan Ugail*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级人脸质量评估框架，通过预过滤低质量图像提升人脸验证系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低质量人脸图像（如运动模糊、光照不足等）会显著降低人脸识别模型的性能，导致高误拒率和误接受率。

Method: 利用归一化面部特征点和随机森林回归分类器评估图像质量。

Result: 在真实数据集上达到96.67%的准确率，误拒率降低99.7%，与ArcFace模型结合效果显著。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时筛查中的分辨率和姿态变化问题，优于现有方法且计算高效。

Abstract: Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the
face verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7\% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.

### [7] [FW-VTON: Flattening-and-Warping for Person-to-Person Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16010)
*Zheng Wang,Xianbing Sun,Shengyi Wu,Jiahui Zhan,Jianlou Si,Chi Zhang,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-VTON是一种新颖的虚拟试衣方法，专注于人物到人物的试衣任务，通过三个阶段实现高质量的试衣效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试衣方法主要关注服装到人物的试衣任务，而本文提出了一种针对人物到人物试衣任务的新方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Method: FW-VTON方法分为三个阶段：提取扁平化服装图像、将服装与目标姿势对齐、将变形后的服装无缝集成到目标人物上。

Result: 实验表明，FW-VTON在定性和定量评估中均达到最先进水平，并在服装提取子任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FW-VTON为人物到人物虚拟试衣任务提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，并通过新数据集进一步推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.

### [8] [Is Tracking really more challenging in First Person Egocentric Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16015)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Zaira Manigrasso,Christian Micheloni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出新基准研究，区分第一人称视角与人类-物体活动领域对视觉跟踪和分割性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将性能下降归因于第一人称视角，但未区分人类-物体活动领域的挑战。

Method: 设计新基准研究，分离第一人称视角和人类-物体活动领域的挑战。

Result: 提供了更精确的困难来源分析，帮助针对性改进。

Conclusion: 新基准有助于更深入理解第一人称视觉跟踪和分割的真正挑战。

Abstract: Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.

### [9] [Artifacts and Attention Sinks: Structured Approximations for Efficient Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16018)
*Andrew Lu,Wentinn Liao,Liuhui Wang,Huzheng Yang,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉Transformer中的大令牌和伪令牌现象，提出了Fast Nyström Attention（FNA）方法，以线性时间和空间近似自注意力，并通过掩码策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉Transformer的内部机制尚不完全清楚，尤其是大令牌和伪令牌在推理过程中对信息流的调节作用。

Method: 提出了FNA方法，利用大令牌和伪令牌的结构化模式近似自注意力，并设计掩码策略减少噪声。

Result: 在多种视觉任务（检索、分类、分割、VQA）上表现优异，同时降低了计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过分析令牌现象并设计高效方法，显著提升了视觉Transformer的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.

### [10] [Discovering and using Spelke segments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16038)
*Rahul Venkatesh,Klemen Kotar,Lilian Naing Chen,Seungwoo Kim,Luca Thomas Wheeler,Jared Watrous,Ashley Xu,Gia Ancone,Wanhee Lee,Honglin Chen,Daniel Bear,Stefan Stojanov,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SpelkeNet模型，通过预测未来运动分布提取Spelke对象，优于传统语义分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类感知基于物理运动关系（Spelke对象），而非语义分类，这更适用于操纵和规划任务。

Method: 构建SpelkeBench数据集，开发SpelkeNet模型预测运动分布，通过统计反事实探测定义Spelke对象。

Result: SpelkeNet在SpelkeBench上优于SegmentAnything，并在3DEditBench上提升物体操纵性能。

Conclusion: Spelke对象概念在计算机视觉中具有实际应用价值，尤其在物理操纵任务中表现优越。

Abstract: Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.

### [11] [Disrupting Semantic and Abstract Features for Better Adversarial Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16052)
*Yuyang Luo,Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Yingzhe He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAFER方法通过平衡语义和抽象特征扰动，提升对抗样本的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征级攻击主要操纵语义信息，忽略了CNN对高频成分的关注。

Method: SAFER结合BLOCKMIX和SELF-MIX，在计算权重矩阵时同时扰动语义和抽象特征。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，SAFER显著提升了对抗样本的可迁移性。

Conclusion: SAFER通过平衡特征扰动，为对抗攻击提供了更有效的策略。

Abstract: Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.

### [12] [Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095)
*Parul Gupta,Abhinav Dhall,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过反馈微调改进个性化图像生成，解决姿势、身份和视线问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决个性化图像生成中复杂活动、身份保留和视线自然性的问题。

Method: 利用姿态、交互、面部识别和视线检测器微调扩散模型，并分时间步引入反馈模块。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，生成的交互、面部身份和图像质量均有提升。

Conclusion: 反馈微调方法有效提升了生成图像的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.

13.56% on the Describable Textures dataset. Similar improvements are observed
in ResNet-34. On the MVTec hazelnut anomaly detection task, the proposed method
achieves competitive results in both segmentation and detection, outperforming
existing approaches.

*Yaofang Liu,Yumeng Ren,Aitor Artola,Yuxuan Hu,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaotong Zhao,Alan Zhao,Raymond H. Chan,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Dandan Tu,Jean-Michel Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pusa提出了一种基于向量化时间步适应（VTA）的新范式，显著提升了视频扩散模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频扩散模型在时间建模上存在局限性，如计算效率低和任务适应性差。

Method: 采用向量化时间步适应（VTA）技术，在统一框架内实现精细时间控制。

Result: Pusa在性能和效率上超越现有模型，训练成本仅为1/200，数据集大小仅为1/2500。

Conclusion: Pusa为下一代视频合成提供了可扩展、高效且多功能的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

To overcome the limitations of conventional max-pooling, we integrate three

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.

Abstract: Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by
accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy
efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which
record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even
finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous
changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR)
dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities,
to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By
preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our
three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video
understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking,
thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will
drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding,
specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在像素空间进行降噪和上采样会引入伪影和失真，影响最终图像质量。

Method: 提出LSSGen框架，使用轻量级潜在上采样器在潜在空间直接进行分辨率缩放。

Result: 在1024^2图像生成中，LSSGen在相似速度下实现了246%的TOPIQ分数提升。

Conclusion: LSSGen显著优于传统缩放方法，支持灵活的多分辨率生成。

Abstract: Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%
TOPIQ score improvement.

Motivation: RGB和DSM的多模态融合在遥感语义分割中存在计算复杂度高和模态对齐不佳的问题，影响了效率和性能。

Method: 设计了非对称双编码器（ADE）、非对称先验融合器（APF）和分布对齐（DA）模块，分别解决冗余、模态对齐和特征分布问题。

Conclusion: AMMNet通过非对称设计和模态对齐优化，显著提升了多模态语义分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtrousMamba模型通过结合局部细节和全局上下文信息，在视觉任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在增强全局感受野时忽视了局部信息的重要性，且Mamba是否能像CNN一样有效提取局部特征尚不明确。

Method: 提出AtrousMamba模型，采用atrous-window选择性扫描机制，逐步扩展扫描范围以平衡局部和全局特征提取。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，AtrousMamba优于CNN、Transformer和Mamba的现有方法。

Conclusion: Mamba不仅能捕捉视觉数据的长程依赖，还能有效保留局部细节。

Abstract: Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.

TL;DR: RSTrack通过显式建模和监督上下文推理，提升视觉跟踪中的时间一致性，并在多个数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流跟踪算法仅通过堆叠历史信息关联上下文，缺乏显式监督，难以有效建模目标动态变化。

Method: 提出三种核心机制：上下文推理机制、前向监督策略和高效状态建模，以增强时间一致性和抑制漂移。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，同时保持实时运行速度。

Conclusion: RSTrack有效解决了传统时间建模中的上下文关联发散问题。

Abstract: Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前TIE模型在图像质量、编辑对齐和一致性方面存在不足，且现有评估基准和指标在规模和人类感知对齐方面有限。

Method: 构建了包含18K编辑图像和55K+人类偏好评分的EBench-18K数据集，并提出了基于LMM的评估指标LMM4Edit。

Result: LMM4Edit在评估TIE模型时表现出色，且与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: EBench-18K和LMM4Edit为TIE模型的评估提供了有效工具，并展示了LMM在图像编辑评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

Result: 实验证明该方法在单步配准中达到最优性能，并可与其他密集配准算法结合进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统配准方法的局限性，提升了低质量指纹图像的配准成功率。

Abstract: Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.

Abstract: Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and
instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited
subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework
incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to
integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and
mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative
multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset
unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide
spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,
detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we
introduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and
generative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted
across a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception
tasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework. The code will be available at

Result: 在具身推理和机器人操作任务中表现出少样本适应、长程规划和自我纠正能力。

Conclusion: ThinkAct为复杂具身AI任务提供了有效的推理与执行结合方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上表现出色，多类别和难度级别均取得强性能。

Conclusion: LDRFusion通过分阶段融合和伪点残差编码模块，有效提升了多传感器融合的检测性能。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D
object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our
framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories
and difficulty levels.

Abstract: Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure
every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite

for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite

Abstract: The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.

Conclusion: SaaS有效解决了多子指令文本的忽略问题，提升了生成模型的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.

Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像（RSI）是地理对象高精度矢量映射的重要数据源，但现有方法通常只能处理小图像块，导致上下文信息丢失和矢量输出碎片化。

Method: HoliTracer通过Context Attention Net（CAN）增强大尺寸RSI的分割，利用局部到全局的注意力机制捕捉上下文依赖；并通过Mask Contour Reformer（MCR）和Polygon Sequence Tracer（PST）实现整体矢量化。

Result: 在大尺寸RSI数据集（如建筑物、水体和道路）上的实验表明，HoliTracer优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HoliTracer是首个从大尺寸RSI中整体提取矢量化地理对象的框架，展示了优越性能。

Abstract: With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and

Abstract: Fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion and pose unique challenges
to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法忽视语言在增强视觉鲁棒性中的作用，导致过拟合或语义指导不足。

Method: 提出QT-AFT，利用高质量文本描述生成对抗样本，增强视觉编码器的鲁棒性。

Result: 在16个零样本数据集上实现最佳对抗鲁棒性和准确率。

Conclusion: 高质量语言监督对提升视觉鲁棒性至关重要，未来工作应关注此方向。

Abstract: Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token减少方法不可逆地丢弃不重要token，无法在后续块中重用，且需平衡模型性能与计算开销。

Method: 提出ToFe框架，包含token识别预测模块和冻结token近似恢复模块，通过预算感知的端到端训练优化。

Result: ToFe将LV-ViT计算成本降低50%，Top-1准确率下降不到2%。

Conclusion: ToFe在性能与复杂度间取得更好平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MAN++通过动态交互机制和EMA参数增强局部学习中的信息流，性能接近端到端训练，同时显著减少GPU内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端反向传播的更新锁定、高GPU内存消耗和缺乏生物合理性问题，同时改善局部学习中的性能下降。

Method: 提出MAN++，利用EMA参数和可学习缩放偏置增强局部块间信息流。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和分割任务中，性能接近端到端训练，且GPU内存使用显著降低。

Conclusion: MAN++为监督局部学习提供了新视角，是传统训练方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本动作识别（FSAR）因训练数据稀缺，现有方法难以捕捉动作的细微变化和时序结构。LGA通过LLM和视觉解剖模块，挖掘动作的核心元素（主体、运动、对象），以提升识别效果。

Method: 1. 使用LLM将动作标签解析为原子动作描述；2. 视觉解剖模块分割视频动作；3. 细粒度融合文本和视觉特征；4. 引入多模态匹配机制（视频-视频和视频-文本匹配）。

Result: LGA在多个FSAR基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LGA通过语言引导的动作解剖和多模态融合，显著提升了少样本动作识别的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dens3R展示了在广泛下游任务中的潜力，提升了密集3D重建的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频方法在参考对象与目标对象外观或结构差异较大时，难以平滑迁移运动。

Method: MotionShot通过语义特征匹配确保高级对齐，再通过形状重定向建立低级形态对齐，并使用时序注意力编码运动。

Result: 实验表明，MotionShot能在显著外观和结构差异下，连贯地迁移运动。

Conclusion: MotionShot通过多级对齐和时序注意力，有效解决了运动迁移中的挑战。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

Result: 在11个数据集上验证了模型在4种下游任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M-SpecGene为多光谱融合提供了统一范式，并展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

Abstract: In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text
Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for
assistive and research-oriented applications, such as asset inspection and
nutrition analysis. The code is available at

Conclusion: OP-SAM通过自动生成提示和迭代优化，显著提升了息肉分割的准确性和泛化能力，减少了标注负担。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.

Abstract: Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.

Abstract: Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial

astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset

celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our
method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of

spherical data on the cortical surface; (2) integration of structural MRI
(sMRI) data, enabling personalized encoding of individual anatomical
variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,
and generalizability across individuals. Experiments demonstrate superior
reconstruction performance compared to SOTA methods, highlighting the
effectiveness and interpretability of our biologically informed approach.

*Lazaro Janier Gonzalez-Sole,Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本PAD框架，利用基础模型在未知攻击场景下实现高性能检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习PAD方法需要大量数据且泛化能力不足，无法应对未知攻击。

Method: 评估基础模型在挑战性实验场景中的表现，并提出简单有效的零样本PAD框架。

Result: 在SiW-Mv2数据库上，最佳基础模型性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基础模型在零样本PAD中表现出色，为未知攻击检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks

Method: 提出ADCD-Net，自适应调制DCT特征贡献，采用分层内容解耦方法减少文本与背景差异，并构建纯净原型捕获未篡改区域痕迹。

Result: 在5种失真类型上平均优于现有方法20.79%，定位准确性和鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: ADCD-Net通过结合RGB/DCT痕迹和文档特性，实现了高效的文档伪造定位，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.

<details>

Motivation: 稀疏视角3D重建在机器人、AR/VR和自动驾驶等应用中至关重要，但传统方法因图像重叠不足而失效，因此需要探索新方法。

Method: 综述了神经隐式模型（如NeRF）、显式点云方法（如3D高斯泼溅）和混合框架，结合几何正则化和生成推理。

Result: 比较了不同方法的准确性、效率和泛化能力，揭示了关键权衡。

Conclusion: 未来方向包括开发3D原生生成先验和实现实时无约束稀疏视角重建，同时需解决领域泛化和无姿态重建的挑战。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly
increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms
are essential for perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment.
However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available
real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new
perception solutions in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce
SynDRA-BBox, a synthetic dataset designed to support object detection and other
vision-based tasks in realistic railway scenarios. To the best of our
knowledge, is the first synthetic dataset specifically tailored for 2D and 3D
object detection in the railway domain, the dataset is publicly available at
https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it. In the presented evaluation, a
state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed
for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the
transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection. Experimental results
demonstrate promising performance, highlighting the effectiveness of synthetic
datasets and domain adaptation techniques in advancing perception capabilities
for railway environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应标签平滑方法，适用于随机擦除和噪声注入等增强技术，但效果在多样化增强方法中消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过自适应标签平滑方法扩展软增强的框架，以适用于更广泛的增强技术。

Method: 通过减少训练样本的标签置信度，基于增强的强度，扩展了自适应标签平滑方法到随机擦除和噪声注入。

Result: 自适应标签平滑在随机擦除中表现良好，但在多样化增强方法（如TrivialAugment）中效果消失，且过度平滑会损害鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自适应标签平滑仅适用于训练数据分布由有限、同质增强类型主导的场景。

Abstract: Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.

Result: 在EndoScapes2023和MOSXAV数据集上优于现有方法，展示了更强的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床应用提供了灵活且高效的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for
autonomous driving scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: DenseSR提出了一种基于密集预测的单图像阴影去除方法，通过几何语义先验和新型Dense Fusion Block解决阴影去除中的模糊和不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴影会降低图像质量，传统方法难以同时恢复阴影内细节和保持边界锐度，导致不一致的修复和模糊。

Method: 结合几何语义先验的深度场景理解和Dense Fusion Block（包含自适应内容平滑模块和纹理边界恢复模块）进行高保真修复。

Result: 实验结果表明，DenseSR在阴影去除效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DenseSR通过密集预测和组件优化，有效解决了阴影去除中的不一致和模糊问题，提升了修复质量。

Abstract: Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

Conclusion: 该方法在多种癌症类型中展现出强大的预测潜力，为癌症生存预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method
across diverse cancer types.

Abstract: Deep learning-based classification of herbarium images is hampered by
background heterogeneity, which introduces noise and artifacts that can
potentially mislead models and reduce classification accuracy. Addressing these
background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We
introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10
for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for
segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing
segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and
evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics.
PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of
0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into
classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five
tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score
improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background
removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances
classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the
foreground plant structures.

Conclusion: C2-Evo能持续改进模型和训练数据，提升多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.

Conclusion: Spatial 3D-LLM通过挖掘更深层次的空间信息，显著提升了3D视觉语言任务的表现。

Abstract: New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

Abstract: Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.

Motivation: 减轻放射科医生的工作负担，为临床医生或患者提供可靠的报告生成模型。

Method: 扩展LLaVA架构，通过简单拼接融合中间特征和细粒度分割图。

Result: 性能提升显著（CE F1分数提升+2.77%），优于其他方法（如COMG和ORID）。

Conclusion: ASaRG具有可扩展性和可验证性，能够结合其他技术进展，并支持报告的溯源验证。

Abstract: Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.

Motivation: 手术器械的可靠识别和定位在计算机和机器人辅助微创手术中至关重要，但实际条件下的鲁棒性仍具挑战性。结合手术上下文（如当前阶段）可提升性能。

Method: 组织PhaKIR子挑战，提供包含13个腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频的多中心数据集，支持手术阶段识别、器械关键点估计和实例分割任务。

Result: 数据集支持器械定位与手术上下文的联合研究，并整合了时间信息，为RAMIS领域提供了高质量资源。

Conclusion: PhaKIR子挑战推动了RAMIS领域的发展，为开发时间感知和上下文驱动的方法提供了独特基准。

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,
context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support
future research in surgical scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉思维链（Visual CoT）训练数据不足和性能差的问题。

Method: 构建包含182,384个样本的Zebra-CoT数据集，涵盖科学问题、2D/3D推理任务等，并微调Anole-7B和Bagel-7B模型。

Result: 测试集准确率提升12%，标准VLM基准评估性能提升13%，生成高质量视觉推理链。

Conclusion: Zebra-CoT有效提升多模态推理能力，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving
complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

<details>

Motivation: 现有Deepfake取证方法多为分类或时间伪造定位任务，限制性强、耗时且难以扩展。

Method: MDP通过多模态交互机制（MI）和可扩展偏差感知损失，感知多模态偏差，精确定位伪造片段起止时间。

Result: 实验表明，MDP在多项评估指标上接近全监督方法的效果。

Conclusion: MDP框架有效解决了弱监督时间伪造定位问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准B-cos网络在解释图中存在严重锯齿伪影和仅支持多分类的问题，以满足医学影像中多标签分类的需求。

Method: 引入FLCPooling和BlurPool抗锯齿策略，并扩展B-cos网络以支持多标签分类。

Result: 改进后的B-cos网络在保持预测性能的同时，提供无伪影且可信的解释，适用于临床多标签场景。

Conclusion: 改进的B-cos网络在医学影像中实现了高性能和可解释性的平衡，适合临床应用。

Abstract: Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the
original B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest
X-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring
abnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce
anti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to
significantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to
support multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets
demonstrate that the modified $\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and
$\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing
faithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in
multi-label settings. Code available at:

Method: 结合3D高斯表示和神经运动场建模，通过自监督优化心脏结构和运动。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上表现优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: Dyna3DGR在心脏运动跟踪中具有高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The
code will be available in https://github.com/windrise/Dyna3DGR.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工精修的分割掩码和对比剂，不切实际。

Method: 通过多视角蒸馏策略解耦时空特征，利用码本特征表示和动态病变自检测。

Result: CTSL在MACE风险预测上优于传统依赖对比剂的方法。

Conclusion: CTSL提供了一种快速、非侵入性的心脏风险评估解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and contrast-free Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) prediction
from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有方法仅简单堆叠Transformer和Mamba层，缺乏深度交互机制，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出A2Mamba，引入多尺度注意力增强的状态空间模型（MASS），通过跨注意力机制增强空间依赖性和动态建模能力。

Result: A2Mamba在ImageNet-1K上达到86.1% top-1准确率，在语义分割、目标检测和实例分割任务中均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: A2Mamba通过深度整合Transformer和Mamba，显著提升了视觉识别任务的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 高质量训练数据对模型泛化能力至关重要，公开数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.

Conclusion: 该方法结合地理知识与合成图像，无需大量真实标注，为遥感建筑分割的泛化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.

Motivation: 低光图像存在颜色偏移、低对比度和噪声等问题，传统Retinex模型在处理这些问题时存在独立通道处理、缺乏神经科学基础、无法完美重建输入图像以及无法解释人类颜色恒常性等缺陷。

Method: 提出四元数Retinex公式，将场景表示为四元数值反射率和照明的Hamilton乘积，并引入反射率一致性指数评估反射率的不变性。

Result: 在低光裂纹检测、变光条件下的人脸检测和红外-可见光融合任务中，性能提升2-11%，具有更好的颜色保真度、更低噪声和更高的反射率稳定性。

Conclusion: 四元数Retinex方法显著优于现有方法，解决了传统模型的缺陷，为低光图像处理提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.

Conclusion: MpGI方法显著提升了遥感图像文本描述的质量，为视觉语言基础模型在遥感领域的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.

Method: 提出了时间约束的视频推理分割任务，要求模型根据包含时间推理的文本查询推断目标对象何时相关，并开发了自动化基准构建方法。

Result: 构建了TCVideoRSBenchmark数据集，包含52个样本，基于MVOR数据集。

Conclusion: 新任务和自动化基准方法为动态场景中的视频分割提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有修复方法需要大量重新训练或微调，且难以保持修复区域与背景的结构和风格一致性。

Method: 利用自注意力机制中的掩码策略，无需模型重新训练或微调，同时利用扩散模型固有属性传递风格信息。

Result: 实验证明HarmonPaint在多样场景和风格中表现优异。

Conclusion: HarmonPaint是一种高效、多功能的图像修复方法，无需训练即可实现高质量修复。

Abstract: Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning
to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.

TL;DR: DFR框架通过多模态分解、对比融合和双路径重建，显著提升了少样本分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖单模态或双模态，无法充分利用多模态信息，DFR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DFR利用SAM模型整合视觉、文本和音频模态，通过分解、对比融合和双路径重建实现多模态语义理解。

Result: 实验表明，DFR在合成和真实场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFR通过系统整合多模态信息，为少样本分割提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: DWCNet在干净和损坏的合成及真实数据集上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DWCNet通过噪声管理和结构建模，显著提升了点云补全的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and
code will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP)框架，用于解决跨域少样本分割问题，通过三个关键模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域少样本分割（CD-FSS）因数据有限和域偏移问题具有挑战性，而现有模型如SAM依赖手动提示且跨域能力有限。

Method: CMP框架包含三个模块：RCT（语义扩展）、CMPG（自动元提示合成）和FAI（域差异缓解）。

Result: 在四个跨域数据集上，CMP在1-shot和5-shot场景下分别达到71.8%和74.5%的mIoU。

Conclusion: CMP框架通过自动化提示和域适应模块，显著提升了跨域少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to
limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction
(FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four
cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving
71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了目标检测网络的量化性能，且无需原始训练数据。

Abstract: Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成数据训练人脸识别模型时因单一生成器导致的模型特定伪影和性能不足问题。

Method: 结合两种不同架构生成的合成人脸数据集，减少伪影并增强多样性。

Result: 在标准人脸识别基准测试中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 通过融合不同架构的合成数据集，显著提升了人脸识别模型的性能。

Abstract: While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在人-物交互合成中表现不佳，HOComp旨在解决这一问题，实现自然且一致的交互合成。

Conclusion: HOComp通过创新的姿态指导和外观保持技术，成功解决了人-物交互合成的挑战，为相关领域提供了新基准。

Abstract: While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 解决传统录取评估中的不透明性、不一致性和申请者焦虑问题。

Method: 利用transformer语义嵌入、LLM评分和XGBoost回归分解申请者档案为三个部分（SAS、EQI、EIS）。

Result: 在合成数据集上表现优异，EQI预测R²为0.80，分类准确率超75%，F1分数0.69（宏观）和0.74（加权）。

Conclusion: CAPS为更公平和数据驱动的录取实践提供了新途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a
novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret
holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles
into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized
Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and
extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging
transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression,
CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human
judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong
performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy
over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74. CAPS
addresses key limitations in traditional holistic review -- particularly the
opacity, inconsistency, and anxiety faced by applicants -- thus paving the way
for more equitable and data-informed admissions practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病在电子健康记录中难以被标准编码系统捕捉，现有方法存在隐私和性能问题。

Method: RDMA模仿医学专家识别罕见疾病模式，通过本地处理临床缩写和隐含疾病模式，结合上下文推理。

Result: RDMA提升F1性能30%以上，降低推理成本10倍，同时减少隐私风险。

Conclusion: RDMA为罕见疾病患者提供更早诊断支持，同时避免云服务的隐私风险。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect 1 in 10 Americans, yet standard ICD coding systems fail
to capture these conditions in electronic health records (EHR), leaving crucial
information buried in clinical notes. Current approaches struggle with medical
abbreviations, miss implicit disease mentions, raise privacy concerns with
cloud processing, and lack clinical reasoning abilities. We present Rare
Disease Mining Agents (RDMA), a framework that mirrors how medical experts
identify rare disease patterns in EHR. RDMA connects scattered clinical
observations that together suggest specific rare conditions. By handling
clinical abbreviations, recognizing implicit disease patterns, and applying
contextual reasoning locally on standard hardware, RDMA reduces privacy risks
while improving F1 performance by upwards of 30\% and decreasing inferences
costs 10-fold. This approach helps clinicians avoid the privacy risk of using
cloud services while accessing key rare disease information from EHR systems,
supporting earlier diagnosis for rare disease patients. Available at

Abstract: Despite the transformative potential of AI, the concept of neural networks
that can produce other neural networks by generating model weights
(hypernetworks) has been largely understudied. One of the possible reasons is
the lack of available research resources that can be used for the purpose of
hypernetwork research. Here we describe a dataset of neural networks, designed
for the purpose of hypernetworks research. The dataset includes $10^4$ LeNet-5
neural networks trained for binary image classification separated into 10
classes, such that each class contains 1,000 different neural networks that can
identify a certain ImageNette V2 class from all other classes. A computing
cluster of over $10^4$ cores was used to generate the dataset. Basic
classification results show that the neural networks can be classified with
accuracy of 72.0%, indicating that the differences between the neural networks
can be identified by supervised machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
purpose of the dataset is to enable hypernetworks research. The dataset and the
code that generates it are open and accessible to the public.

Abstract: Prompt design is a critical factor in the effectiveness of Large Language
Models (LLMs), yet remains largely heuristic, manual, and difficult to scale.
This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) methods for real-world, high-stakes multiclass
classification in a commercial setting, addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature where most of the APO frameworks have been validated only
on benchmark classification tasks of limited complexity.
  We introduce APE-OPRO, a novel hybrid framework that combines the
complementary strengths of APE and OPRO, achieving notably better
cost-efficiency, around $18\%$ improvement over OPRO, without sacrificing
performance. We benchmark APE-OPRO alongside both gradient-free (APE, OPRO) and
gradient-based (ProTeGi) methods on a dataset of ~2,500 labeled products.
  Our results highlight key trade-offs: ProTeGi offers the strongest absolute
performance at lower API cost but higher computational time as noted
in~\cite{protegi}, while APE-OPRO strikes a compelling balance between
performance, API efficiency, and scalability. We further conduct ablation
studies on depth and breadth hyperparameters, and reveal notable sensitivity to
label formatting, indicating implicit sensitivity in LLM behavior. These
findings provide actionable insights for implementing APO in commercial
applications and establish a foundation for future research in multi-label,

Motivation: 离散流模型（DFMs）因依赖迭代解码导致采样速度慢，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi)，通过校正源与目标分布的耦合减少因子化误差。

Result: ReDi显著减少条件总相关（TC），支持少步生成，并适用于高效一步模型训练。

Conclusion: ReDi为高效离散数据合成提供了简单且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for
high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due
to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a
multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,
which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we
rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using
Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce
the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose
Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces
factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target
distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a
monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,
ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for
training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple
and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,
providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is

Motivation: 标准VAE在高维潜在空间中，随机采样的潜在向量通常无法生成有意义的数据，原因是潜在向量在超球面上均匀分布。

Method: 提出使用超球坐标参数化潜在变量，将潜在向量压缩到超球面上的一个岛屿区域，减少稀疏性。

Result: 新方法在有限计算开销下，显著提升了VAE的生成能力。

Conclusion: 通过超球坐标参数化潜在空间，可以有效解决高维潜在空间中的稀疏性问题，提升VAE的生成效果。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent
vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, decoding a
random latent vector from the prior usually does not produce meaningful data,
at least when the latent space has more than a dozen dimensions. In this paper,
we investigate this issue by drawing insight from high dimensional statistics:
in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are by construction
distributed uniformly on a hypersphere. We propose to formulate the latent
variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing
the latent vectors towards an island on the hypersphere, thereby reducing the
latent sparsity and we show that this improves the generation ability of the
VAE. We propose a new parameterization of the latent space with limited
computational overhead.

Result: 实验证明HalMit在幻觉监测上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HalMit的黑盒特性和高性能使其成为提升LLM系统可靠性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a
popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI
deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are
inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the
credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the
intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.
Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to
ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches
either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify
hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent
agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the
generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations
without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a
probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient
number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently
identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing
approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior
performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of
LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised
technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets.
However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance
limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In
this work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT

Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach
achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving
the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of
real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify
subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and
t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering

Abstract: In line with the development of deep learning, this survey examines the
transformative role of Transformers and foundation models in advancing visual
anomaly detection (VAD). We explore how these architectures, with their global
receptive fields and adaptability, address challenges such as long-range
dependency modeling, contextual modeling and data scarcity. The survey
categorizes VAD methods into reconstruction-based, feature-based and
zero/few-shot approaches, highlighting the paradigm shift brought about by
foundation models. By integrating attention mechanisms and leveraging
large-scale pre-training, Transformers and foundation models enable more
robust, interpretable, and scalable anomaly detection solutions. This work

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）对齐中奖励模型的不稳定性，提出了一种方差感知策略优化框架以提高对齐的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐策略依赖单一奖励模型估计，容易因奖励模型的不准确性而失效。

Method: 通过实证研究奖励模型训练的变异性，提出方差感知策略优化框架，引入奖励模型方差估计的策略正则化器。

Result: 实验证明该方法能减少输出比默认策略更差的风险，提高对齐的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 方差感知策略优化能有效缓解奖励模型估计的变异性问题，提升LLM对齐的可靠性。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) typically involves training a
reward model on preference data, followed by policy optimization with respect
to the reward model. However, optimizing policies with respect to a single
reward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward
model. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on
open-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on
the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting
the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,
we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause
overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this
risk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for
preference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy
regularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that
variance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a
worse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model
configurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust
alignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合了双图灵测试、对抗分类游戏和强化学习对齐流程，强调质量阈值和对抗训练的结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过双图灵测试和对抗训练改进AI对齐问题，确保AI行为既高质量又难以检测。

Method: 结合双图灵测试、对抗分类游戏和强化学习对齐流程，定义质量函数和参数，并将其建模为零和游戏。

Result: 框架提供了质量保证和对抗训练的明确方法，为AI对齐问题提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 建议立即行动，进一步验证框架的实用性和扩展性。

Abstract: In this short note, we propose a unified framework that bridges three areas:
(1) a flipped perspective on the Turing Test, the "dual Turing test", in which
a human judge's goal is to identify an AI rather than reward a machine for
deception; (2) a formal adversarial classification game with explicit quality
constraints and worst-case guarantees; and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL)
alignment pipeline that uses an undetectability detector and a set of quality
related components in its reward model. We review historical precedents, from
inverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing
classifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased
difficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define
the judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a
prompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,
and cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's
feasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style
alignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward
for stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.
Throughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the
meaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative
adversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate
actions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDRA提出了一种混合驱动架构，用于提高知识图谱（KG）自动构建的可靠性，并通过符号验证评估其功能完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识图谱自动构建中的输出可靠性、一致性和可验证性问题，如结构不一致或数据孤立。

Result: HyDRA提高了KG自动构建的可靠性，并提供了功能完整性评估框架。

Conclusion: HyDRA为神经符号AI中的知识图谱自动化提供了可靠解决方案，并探索了新的评估方法。

Abstract: The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to
advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications
as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This
work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of
automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for
measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly
available.

Motivation: 探索压缩对模型可解释性的影响，尤其是稀疏自编码器（SAE）在原始和压缩模型中的表现差异。

Method: 比较原始模型和压缩模型的SAE性能，并测试直接修剪原始SAE的效果。

Result: 原始SAE可解释压缩模型，性能略降；修剪原始SAE效果接近重新训练SAE。

Conclusion: 通过修剪原始SAE可节省训练成本，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Modern LLMs face inference efficiency challenges due to their scale. To
address this, many compression methods have been proposed, such as pruning and
quantization. However, the effect of compression on a model's interpretability
remains elusive. While several model interpretation approaches exist, such as
circuit discovery, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven particularly
effective in decomposing a model's activation space into its feature basis. In
this work, we explore the differences in SAEs for the original and compressed
models. We find that SAEs trained on the original model can interpret the
compressed model albeit with slight performance degradation compared to the
trained SAE on the compressed model. Furthermore, simply pruning the original
SAE itself achieves performance comparable to training a new SAE on the pruned
model. This finding enables us to mitigate the extensive training costs of
SAEs.

<details>

Motivation: 传统高斯过程校准方法难以捕捉深度神经网络的内部层次结构，限制了预测可靠性的评估效果和可解释性。

Method: 采用多层高斯过程模型，每层的特征表示映射到局部校准校正，通过结构化多层核耦合各层，实现联合边缘化。

Result: SAL-GP能够捕捉局部语义依赖和全局校准一致性，并传播预测不确定性，提升置信度一致性和不确定性量化的评估。

Conclusion: SAL-GP框架增强了与网络架构对齐的可解释性，为深度模型的置信度一致性和不确定性量化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

Result: 发现持续学习是研究神经训练动态的丰富测试平台，静态核近似在持续学习中无效。

Conclusion: 持续学习为NTK动态研究提供了新视角，并揭示了静态核近似的局限性。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the
functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel
regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is
linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK
during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep
learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical
discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However,
this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data
distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where
the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual
learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural
training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel
approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large
scale.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning, reducing computational complexity and
memory consumption has become a critical challenge, and ternary neural networks
(NNs) that restrict parameters to $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ have attracted attention as a
promising approach. While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in
practical applications such as image recognition and natural language
processing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this
paper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the
perspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the
number of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions
increases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with
respect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices
to either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a
lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of
general ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some
sense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative
disorder with substantial heterogeneity in progression and treatment response.
Despite recent therapeutic advances, predictive models capable of accurately
forecasting individualized disease trajectories remain limited. Here, we
present a machine learning-based operator learning framework for personalized
modeling of AD progression, integrating longitudinal multimodal imaging,

dynamics, our approach directly learns patient-specific disease operators
governing the spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration
biomarkers. Using Laplacian eigenfunction bases, we construct geometry-aware
neural operators capable of capturing complex brain dynamics. Embedded within a
digital twin paradigm, the framework enables individualized predictions,
simulation of therapeutic interventions, and in silico clinical trials. Applied
to AD clinical data, our method achieves high prediction accuracy exceeding 90%
across multiple biomarkers, substantially outperforming existing approaches.
This work offers a scalable, interpretable platform for precision modeling and
personalized therapeutic optimization in neurodegenerative diseases.

Conclusion: DWM为模型训练中的数据偏好提供了新见解，并提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: While large-scale training data is fundamental for developing capable large
language models (LLMs), strategically selecting high-quality data has emerged
as a critical approach to enhance training efficiency and reduce computational
costs. Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,
training-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training
and data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model
(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a
dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the
dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework
is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and
the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection
methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a
model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights
into the data preference of the model during training.

Conclusion: EBaReT有效解决了数据质量和奖励不确定性问题，提升了自动竞价的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a "bag" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.

Method: 提出RealBench，包含复杂、结构化的开源IP设计，多模态设计规范和严格验证环境。

Result: 评估显示，最佳LLM在模块级任务中仅13.3%通过率，系统级任务为0%，表明未来需更强模型。

Conclusion: RealBench为Verilog生成提供了更真实的评估标准，推动未来模型发展。

Abstract: The automatic generation of Verilog code using Large Language Models (LLMs)
has garnered significant interest in hardware design automation. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in Verilog generation fall short in
replicating real-world design workflows due to their designs' simplicity,
inadequate design specifications, and less rigorous verification environments.
To address these limitations, we present RealBench, the first benchmark aiming
at real-world IP-level Verilog generation tasks. RealBench features complex,
structured, real-world open-source IP designs, multi-modal and formatted design
specifications, and rigorous verification environments, including 100% line
coverage testbenches and a formal checker. It supports both module-level and
system-level tasks, enabling comprehensive assessments of LLM capabilities.
Evaluations on various LLMs and agents reveal that even one of the
best-performing LLMs, o1-preview, achieves only a 13.3% pass@1 on module-level
tasks and 0% on system-level tasks, highlighting the need for stronger Verilog
generation models in the future. The benchmark is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致合成内容日益逼真，增加了错误信息的风险。现有检测方法缺乏详细和可解释的伪造分析，且缺乏跨模态的统一基准。

Method: 提出METER基准，包含四个轨道，要求分类和基于证据链的解释。提出三阶段Chain-of-Thought训练策略（SFT、DPO和GRPO）。

Result: METER提供了更广泛的模态覆盖和更丰富的解释性指标，如时空IoU和多类追踪。

Conclusion: METER有望成为推动可泛化和可解释伪造检测的标准化基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images,
videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of
misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary
classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of
forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios.
Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a
unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To
address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark
for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and
audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not
only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations,
including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type
tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage
and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class
tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned,
three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a
novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning.
We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing
generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative
media.

the surface-local phenomena driving intermolecular behavior. 3D-based
approaches often reduce surface detail or require computationally expensive
SE(3)-equivariant architectures to manage spatial variance. To overcome these
limitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and
Topology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that
combines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors
within an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically
meaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates
transformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with
conventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN
framework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For
molecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful
data, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR
enables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values
using Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints
as auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,
and an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task. These results help demonstrate that
AMPTCR offers a compact, expressive, and architecture-agnostic representation
for modeling surface-mediated molecular properties.

Abstract: Mapping deep neural networks (DNNs) to hardware is critical for optimizing
latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization, making it a cornerstone
of high-performance accelerator design. Due to the vast and complex mapping
space, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach-but its
effectiveness is often limited by sample inefficiency. We present a
decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to
overcome this challenge. By distributing the search across multiple agents, our
framework accelerates exploration. To avoid inefficiencies from training
multiple agents in parallel, we introduce an agent clustering algorithm that
assigns similar mapping parameters to the same agents based on correlation
analysis. This enables a decentralized, parallelized learning process that
significantly improves sample efficiency. Experimental results show our MARL
approach improves sample efficiency by 30-300x over standard single-agent RL,
achieving up to 32.61x latency reduction and 16.45x energy-delay product (EDP)
reduction under iso-sample conditions.

TL;DR: STWeaver是一种GPU内存分配器，通过结合离线规划和在线分配，显著减少内存碎片，提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速扩展增加了GPU内存压力，现有分配器因缺乏对张量生命周期的了解导致内存浪费和碎片化。

Method: STWeaver利用内存分配行为的时空规律性，结合离线规划和在线分配，优化内存使用。

Result: 平均减少79.2%的内存碎片（最高100%），训练性能提升高达32.5%。

Conclusion: STWeaver有效解决了内存碎片问题，支持更高效的训练配置。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased
GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible
overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations
and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.

Result: 任务复杂度决定最小模型容量；稀疏子网络性能优异；过参数化提升输入噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 揭示了简单神经网络中容量、稀疏性和鲁棒性的基本权衡关系。

Abstract: Although modern deep learning often relies on massive over-parameterized
models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.

Conclusion: ResAlign为提升扩散模型的安全性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.

Conclusion: 领域适应的LLM在加速材料发现方面具有潜力，为钙钛矿光伏研究提供了智能、数据驱动的闭环框架。

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in
next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power
conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these
advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability,
and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.
Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by
enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive
growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,
processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for
researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in
this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a
specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities
tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By
systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications
and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we
constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated
question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the
QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can
intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and
practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor
additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies
confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.
Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating
materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent,
data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.

Result: 攻击方法紧密匹配已知上界Õ(k²)，揭示了压缩表示的结构性漏洞。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了线性素描技术的基本脆弱性，并与图像分类中的对抗攻击有结构相似性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction via linear sketching is a powerful and widely used
technique, but it is known to be vulnerable to adversarial inputs. We study the
black-box adversarial setting, where a fixed, hidden sketching matrix A in
$R^{k X n}$ maps high-dimensional vectors v $\in R^n$ to lower-dimensional
sketches A v in $R^k$, and an adversary can query the system to obtain
approximate ell2-norm estimates that are computed from the sketch.
  We present a universal, nonadaptive attack that, using tilde(O)($k^2$)
queries, either causes a failure in norm estimation or constructs an
adversarial input on which the optimal estimator for the query distribution
(used by the attack) fails. The attack is completely agnostic to the sketching
matrix and to the estimator: It applies to any linear sketch and any query
responder, including those that are randomized, adaptive, or tailored to the
query distribution.
  Our lower bound construction tightly matches the known upper bounds of
tilde(Omega)($k^2$), achieved by specialized estimators for Johnson
Lindenstrauss transforms and AMS sketches. Beyond sketching, our results
uncover structural parallels to adversarial attacks in image classification,
highlighting fundamental vulnerabilities of compressed representations.

Result: 在异质图下游任务中优于5/7的先进方法，同时在同质图中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: HPGNN通过平衡多尺度信息和抗噪性，成为图学习的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in node classification tasks but often
assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar labels. This assumption
does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for
heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking
multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal
performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across
nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating
Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces
an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture
long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces
computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By
embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks,
HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness.
The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art
methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining
competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance
multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution
for real-world graph learning challenges. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有研究未充分利用截尾样本的价值，且在模态缺失场景下性能下降。CenSurv旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用双图结构建模多模态数据，设计完整-不完整对齐策略探索模态无关特征，并通过动态动量累积置信度选择可靠截尾数据。

Result: 在5个公开癌症数据集上，CenSurv的平均C-index比现有最佳方法高3.1%，且在模态缺失场景下表现稳健。

Conclusion: CenSurv通过事件条件建模和双图学习显著提升了癌症生存预测性能，尤其在处理截尾数据和模态缺失时表现突出。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for
personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the
relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully
leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer
performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during
the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality
graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer
survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to
model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance
degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to
simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing
scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore
modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play
event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored
data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate
survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data
into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase
the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of
the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various
modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module,
the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of
CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.

Conclusion: 避免了过参数化，提供了更实用的理论框架。

Abstract: This work focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
solving least-squares regression with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
Past work on this topic has been based on the over-parameterization regime,
whose convergence may require the network width to increase vastly with the
number of training samples. So, the theory derived from over-parameterization
may incur prohibitive computational costs and is far from practical
experiments. We perform new optimization and generalization analysis for SGD in
training two-layer PINNs, making certain assumptions about the target function
to avoid over-parameterization. Given $\epsilon>0$, we show that if the network
width exceeds a threshold that depends only on $\epsilon$ and the problem, then
the training loss and expected loss will decrease below $O(\epsilon)$.

Abstract: Unbalanced tabular data sets present significant challenges for predictive
modeling and data analysis across a wide range of applications. In many
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and rare
event prediction, minority classes are vastly underrepresented, making it
difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
These algorithms tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased models
that struggle to accurately represent minority classes. Synthetic data holds
promise for addressing the under-representation of minority classes by
providing new, diverse, and highly realistic samples. This paper presents a
benchmark study on the use of AI-generated synthetic data for upsampling highly
unbalanced tabular data sets.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of an open-source solution, the Synthetic Data
SDK by MOSTLY AI, which provides a flexible and user-friendly approach to
synthetic upsampling for mixed-type data. We compare predictive models trained
on data sets upsampled with synthetic records to those using standard methods,
such as naive oversampling and SMOTE-NC. Our results demonstrate that synthetic
data can improve predictive accuracy for minority groups by generating diverse
data points that fill gaps in sparse regions of the feature space. We show that
upsampled synthetic training data consistently results in top-performing
predictive models, particularly for mixed-type data sets containing very few
minority samples.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Abstract: Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods
reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health,
finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered
clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were
developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns
has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where
geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in
continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this
validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically
defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into
finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect
ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical
patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5
norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior
performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately
detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation
guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous
correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be
useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment
that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must
be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a
central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant
structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both
model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial
homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which
abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable
building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation
of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.

Abstract: Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design
choices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces
two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily
rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available
benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements
often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate
repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further
development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an
extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes
it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the
decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this
framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them
with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how
gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code can be

Abstract: We propose a multilayered symbolic framework for general graph classification
that leverages sparse binary hypervectors and Tsetlin Machines. Each graph is
encoded through structured message passing, where node, edge, and attribute
information are bound and bundled into a symbolic hypervector. This process
preserves the hierarchical semantics of the graph through layered binding from
node attributes to edge relations to structural roles resulting in a compact,
discrete representation. We also formulate a local interpretability framework
which lends itself to a key advantage of our approach being locally
interpretable. We validate our method on TUDataset benchmarks, demonstrating
competitive accuracy with strong symbolic transparency compared to neural graph
models.

Motivation: 现有FGL综述主要关注联邦学习（FL）和图机器学习（GML）的整合，缺乏从数据角度系统分析FGL方法的研究。

Method: 提出两级数据为中心的分类法：数据特性（基于数据集的结构和分布特性）和数据利用（分析训练过程和技术）。

Result: 通过分类法评估FGL研究如何解决数据中心的约束以提升模型性能，并探讨了FGL与预训练大模型的整合。

Conclusion: 该综述不仅提供了新的分类视角，还展示了实际应用，并指出了与GML新兴趋势一致的未来方向。

Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has
emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing
the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and
preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have
contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning
(FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that
emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric
perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data
properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is
critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to
enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric
taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the
structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data
Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to
overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three
orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration.
Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large
Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction
aligned with emerging trends in GML.

Conclusion: 该方法为CW复形的学习和分析提供了有效的工具，扩展了最优传输在复杂结构中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning
representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods
suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit
expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal
distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a
structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal
transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and
structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW
complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability
measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.

TL;DR: 提出稀疏状态扩展（SSE）方法，通过稀疏分类和状态分区改进线性注意力，提升长上下文建模效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在长上下文场景中因计算和内存问题表现不佳，现有线性注意力方法虽提升效率但牺牲性能。

Method: 引入稀疏分类更新和状态扩展（SSE），通过分区和并行化实现高效上下文压缩。

Result: SSE在语言建模、检索和数学推理任务中表现优异，2B模型在AIME基准上显著超越同类Transformer。

Conclusion: SSE是高效长上下文建模的有前景架构。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with
long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth.
While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints
by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance
in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation
and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.
First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by
conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables
sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby
extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we
present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands
the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter
size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.
Our design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields
effective classification and discriminative state representations. We
extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures
across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably
with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B
SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among
small reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,
significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These
results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for
long-context modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于元学习的参数高效提示调优框架，用于冷启动用户的个性化推荐，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动用户推荐问题，传统方法（如监督微调和协同过滤）成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用元学习框架，通过一阶（Reptile）和二阶（MAML）优化学习软提示嵌入，将每个用户视为任务。

Result: 在MovieLens-1M等数据集上，模型在NDCG@10等指标上优于基线，且适应速度快（275 ms）。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效支持冷启动用户推荐，并可用于金融系统的实时风险分析，提升支付网络稳定性。

Abstract: Generative, explainable, and flexible recommender systems, derived using
Large Language Models (LLM) are promising and poorly adapted to the cold-start
user situation, where there is little to no history of interaction. The current
solutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are
dense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This
paper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform
parameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based
recommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt
embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by
treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,
these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent
user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic
sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On
MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model
outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in
real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization
is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation
allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening
detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275
ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial
institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly
versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment
networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial
infrastructure resilience.

Conclusion: 通过结合神经科学与机器学习，提出了一种解决视觉绑定问题的新机制，展示了其在性能上的优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of
artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the
agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the
network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture
that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by
agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by
matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire
network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise
robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification
tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that
combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling
neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that
the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of
neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the
same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We
drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all
layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto
dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with
similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits
of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one
composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.
Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to
noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel
mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by
leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Motivation: 传统ABFT技术无法有效处理完整的注意力机制，尤其是中间softmax归一化操作，因此需要一种更高效的方法来检测硬件故障引起的错误。

Method: 提出Flash-ABFT，计算注意力层中三矩阵乘积（包括softmax操作）的在线校验和，通过单次检查减少冗余。

Result: 实验结果显示，Flash-ABFT仅增加5.3%的硬件面积开销和不到1.9%的能源开销。

Conclusion: Flash-ABFT是一种成本效益高且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于注意力加速器中的错误检测。

Abstract: Transformers and large language models (LLMs), powered by the attention
mechanism, have transformed numerous AI applications, driving the need for
specialized hardware accelerators. A major challenge in these accelerators is
efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional
algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix
multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism,
particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization. This work proposes
Flash-ABFT, a novel method that computes an online checksum across the entire
three-matrix product of query, key and value matrices, of an attention layer,
including the softmax operation, with a single check. This approach
significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while
maintaining high fault-detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that Flash-ABFT incurs only 5.3% hardware area overhead and less than 1.9%
energy overhead, making it a cost-effective and robust solution for error
detection in attention accelerators.

Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the
meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks
that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on
different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches
may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a
novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic
communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair
that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel
equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel
impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving
a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic
MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity
constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the
main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the
solutions.

Motivation: 工业信号异质性（M5问题）导致现有方法无法利用模态协同和规模效应，需统一建模。

Method: FISHER以STFT子带为建模单元，采用师生自监督学习框架预训练，支持任意采样率。

Result: 在RMIS基准测试中，FISHER性能优于其他自监督模型，提升达5.03%。

Conclusion: FISHER展示了统一建模的潜力，开源并提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze
industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the
industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we
summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems
and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between
modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals
can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a
result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal
compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER
considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band
information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit
and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop
the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial
signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,
FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general
performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We
also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential
avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多macOS应用的无障碍元数据不完整或缺失，导致依赖屏幕阅读器等工具的用户无法充分使用。现有研究未能全面捕捉桌面界面的层次结构复杂性。

Method: Screen2AX结合视觉语言和对象检测模型，从单张截图中检测、描述并层次化组织UI元素，生成与macOS系统级无障碍结构一致的元数据。

Result: Screen2AX在重建完整无障碍树时F1得分为77%，在Screen2AX-Task基准测试中性能提升2.2倍，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Screen2AX填补了桌面界面无障碍元数据的空白，显著提升了AI代理的任务执行能力。

Abstract: Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.

Motivation: 在数据为中心的AI时代，高质量训练数据的筛选至关重要。传统基于敏感性的核心集构建方法在优化分类性能指标（如F1分数）方面表现不足。

Method: 引入新的可调参数（如确定性采样、类间分配和主动采样细化），超越传统的敏感性评分。

Result: 在多种数据集和分类器上的实验表明，调整后的核心集在关键分类指标上显著优于传统核心集和完整数据集训练。

Conclusion: 提供了一种更高效、更优的模型训练路径。

Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the ability to curate high-quality training
data is as crucial as model design. Coresets offer a principled approach to
data reduction, enabling efficient learning on large datasets through
importance sampling. However, conventional sensitivity-based coreset
construction often falls short in optimizing for classification performance
metrics, e.g., $F1$ score, focusing instead on loss approximation. In this
work, we present a systematic framework for tuning the coreset generation
process to enhance downstream classification quality. Our method introduces new
tunable parameters--including deterministic sampling, class-wise allocation,
and refinement via active sampling, beyond traditional sensitivity scores.
Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and classifiers, we
demonstrate that tuned coresets can significantly outperform both vanilla
coresets and full dataset training on key classification metrics, offering an
effective path towards better and more efficient model training.

Motivation: 下一代超级计算机将具备百亿亿次计算能力，但数据存储能力有限，需要高效、可扩展的机器学习算法进行原位训练。独立分区的SVGP模型虽高效，但边界不连续。

Method: 扩展SVGP模型，允许相邻空间分区进行少量通信，以优化局部模型对齐，从而生成更平滑的预测。

Result: 改进后的分区SVGP（PSVGP）在保持高扩展性和低计算开销的同时，显著提升了预测的平滑性和整体拟合效果。

Conclusion: PSVGP方法通过局部通信解决了独立SVGP模型的边界问题，适用于大规模分布式计算场景，如E3SM模型。

Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of
exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible
than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely
on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical
analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning
algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting
must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is
distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable
approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model
independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is
scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect
of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between
neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea
by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial
partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to
smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our
decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly
scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in
terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the
independent SVGP case.

Result: 在三个微调任务中成功减少意外泛化，特别是在突发性错位任务中，将错位响应减少10倍。

Conclusion: CAFT提供了一种无需修改训练数据即可控制LLM泛化的新方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended
out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on
modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the
intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce
Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages
interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without
needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target
distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding
to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear
projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended
generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,
including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow
task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.
Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses
by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,
CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without
modifying training data.

Abstract: When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a
variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful
applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the
correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize
guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect
of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate
incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper
describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach
to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated
confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical
confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward
function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a
scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.
We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that
uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both
accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR
substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain
and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and
classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL
hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized
confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration
via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly
optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning
models.

Abstract: Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy

TL;DR: Flax提出了一种结合神经预测与符号扩展的NeSy松弛策略，显著提升了任务规划的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务规划涉及大量实体和复杂关系，传统符号规划器面临组合爆炸问题，现有神经符号方法可能遗漏关键实体或浪费资源。

Method: Flax通过图神经网络预测实体重要性生成简化任务，结合符号规划器求解松弛任务并重新整合遗漏实体，最后通过补充规则优化任务。

Result: 实验表明，Flax在迷宫导航任务中平均成功率提升20.82%，规划时间减少17.65%。

Conclusion: Flax为复杂环境中的快速、可扩展长程任务规划提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of
entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial
explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent
methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few
"important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting
resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning,
we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance
prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural
network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it
with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick
rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to
recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary
rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact.
Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze
navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact
with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success
rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with
the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path
toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对LiDAR里程计管线中各个组件的详细比较研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 总结LO管线的技术，并在多种数据集、环境、LiDAR类型和车辆运动中进行实证评估。

Result: 通过实证评估，提出了提高LO管线准确性和可靠性的设计建议。

Conclusion: 本文为未来LO管线的设计提供了实证支持的建议，以提高其性能。

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become the sensor of choice
for many robotic state estimation tasks. Because of this, in recent years there
has been significant work done to fine the most accurate method to perform
state estimation using these sensors. In each of these prior works, an
explosion of possible technique combinations has occurred, with each work
comparing LiDAR Odometry (LO) "pipelines" to prior "pipelines". Unfortunately,
little work up to this point has performed the significant amount of ablation
studies comparing the various building-blocks of a LO pipeline. In this work,
we summarize the various techniques that go into defining a LO pipeline and
empirically evaluate these LO components on an expansive number of datasets
across environments, LiDAR types, and vehicle motions. Finally, we make
empirically-backed recommendations for the design of future LO pipelines to
provide the most accurate and reliable performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种联合学习方法，解决超低分辨率语义分割问题，实现隐私保护的机器人导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人中的用户隐私问题日益重要，现有方法难以兼顾任务性能和隐私保护。

Method: 采用聚合特征提取器和分割感知判别器的联合学习方法。

Result: 在超低分辨率语义分割任务上优于基线方法，提升了隐私约束场景下的导航成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了隐私保护和任务性能，适用于真实世界的隐私约束场景。

Abstract: User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing
methods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks
or privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of
task execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based
robot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.
A key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from
ultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully
joint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a
segmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic
segmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal
navigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution
semantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the
success rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world
privacy-constrained scenario.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理人-机器人-人交互（pHRHI）的新型步态康复方法，通过双向交互结合治疗师直觉与机器人精确性，改善中风患者康复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统康复方法中治疗师手动辅助强度大且难以同时控制多关节，机器人外骨骼虽提供多关节支持但缺乏治疗师参与和适应性。

Method: 治疗师和患者穿戴下肢外骨骼，通过虚拟弹簧-阻尼元件连接髋关节和膝关节，实现双向交互和触觉反馈。

Result: 在八名慢性中风患者中，pHRHI训练在关节活动范围、步态指标、肌肉激活和动机方面优于传统治疗师引导的跑步机行走。

Conclusion: pHRHI结合了机器人精确性和治疗师直觉，有望提升康复效果。

Abstract: Following a stroke, individuals often experience mobility and balance
impairments due to lower-limb weakness and loss of independent joint control.
Gait recovery is a key goal of rehabilitation, traditionally achieved through
high-intensity therapist-led training. However, manual assistance can be
physically demanding and limits the therapist's ability to interact with
multiple joints simultaneously. Robotic exoskeletons offer multi-joint support,
reduce therapist strain, and provide objective feedback, but current control
strategies often limit therapist involvement and adaptability.
  We present a novel gait rehabilitation paradigm based on physical
Human-Robot-Human Interaction (pHRHI), where both the therapist and the
post-stroke individual wear lower-limb exoskeletons virtually connected at the
hips and knees via spring-damper elements. This enables bidirectional
interaction, allowing the therapist to guide movement and receive haptic
feedback. In a study with eight chronic stroke patients, pHRHI training
outperformed conventional therapist-guided treadmill walking, leading to
increased joint range of motion, step metrics, muscle activation, and
motivation. These results highlight pHRHI's potential to combine robotic
precision with therapist intuition for improved rehabilitation outcomes.

TL;DR: LAN2CB框架利用大语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言任务描述直接转换为多机器人系统的可执行Python代码，简化了传统专家驱动的多机器人协调流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多机器人协调流程依赖专家手动翻译任务描述，耗时且难以适应任务需求变化，LAN2CB旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LAN2CB通过任务分解和代码生成两个关键组件，将任务描述解析为任务图并生成可部署的控制代码。

Result: 实验表明，LAN2CB在仿真和实际场景中均能有效实现多机器人协调，显著减少人工工程需求。

Conclusion: LAN2CB为多机器人协调提供了一种灵活且通用的解决方案，降低了非专家的使用门槛。

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a task-specific and
expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are
manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm
design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive,
inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements.
Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework
that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the
multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language
mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems
through two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation,
which parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code
Generation, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to
generate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of
natural language mission specifications to support development and
benchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings
show that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from
natural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while
supporting generalization across mission types. Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合频域和时域信息的新型网络架构，显著提升了惯性里程计的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有惯性里程计方法主要依赖时域CNN，难以捕捉长期依赖关系，限制了定位精度的进一步提升。

Method: 利用频域学习的全局视角和能量压缩特性建模长期依赖，减少冗余；引入Scalar LSTM捕获时域序列依赖，实现跨域信息融合。

Result: 在RoNIN数据集上，绝对轨迹误差降低43.0%，相对轨迹误差降低13.1%。

Conclusion: 频域-时域融合策略有效提升了惯性里程计的定位性能。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has achieved significant advancements in
inertial odometry. However, most existing inertial odometry methods primarily
rely on CNNs in the time domain. These methods often struggle to capture
long-term dependency in inertial measurement unit data, thereby constraining
the potential for further improvements in localization accuracy. To address
these issues, we propose a novel network architecture that integrates both
frequency-domain and time-domain information. Specifically, we leverage the
global view and energy compaction properties of frequency-domain learning to
effectively model long-term dependency and reduce redundancy in IMU data.
Additionally, we introduce a Scalar LSTM to capture sequential dependencies in
the time domain, enabling cross-domain information fusion and providing a
stable and reliable reference for localization. Experimental evaluations on
multiple public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, OxIOD, RNIN, TLIO, and IMUNet)
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-time domain fusion
strategy. Notably, on the RoNIN dataset, our method achieves a 43.0% reduction
in absolute trajectory error and a 13.1% reduction in relative trajectory error
compared to RoNIN ResNet.

Conclusion: 该方法通过提取复杂运动特征和动态建模，显著提升了惯性里程计的性能，为领域设定了新基准。

Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) directly estimates the position of a carrier from
inertial sensor measurements and serves as a core technology for the widespread
deployment of consumer grade localization systems. While existing IO methods
can accurately reconstruct simple and near linear motion trajectories, they
often fail to account for drift errors caused by complex motion patterns such
as turning. This limitation significantly degrades localization accuracy and
restricts the applicability of IO systems in real world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a lightweight IO framework. Specifically, inertial
data is projected into a high dimensional implicit nonlinear feature space
using the Star Operation method, enabling the extraction of complex motion
features that are typically overlooked. We further introduce a collaborative
attention mechanism that jointly models global motion dynamics across both
channel and temporal dimensions. In addition, we design Multi Scale Gated
Convolution Units to capture fine grained dynamic variations throughout the
motion process, thereby enhancing the model's ability to learn rich and
expressive motion representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA baselines across six widely used
inertial datasets. Compared to baseline models on the RoNIN dataset, it
achieves reductions in ATE ranging from 2.26% to 65.78%, thereby establishing a
new benchmark in the field.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在社交机器人中的应用增加，处理敏感数据的隐私风险成为关键问题。

Method: 通过情境完整性（CI）框架设计隐私相关场景，调查用户偏好并测试LLMs的隐私意识。

Result: 人类与LLMs在隐私偏好上的一致性较低，提示策略对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在隐私意识方面仍需改进，未来需进一步探索AI在隐私控制中的潜力。

Abstract: Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following
human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal
cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have
previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user
interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new
opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot
interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to
collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a
result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within
home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks,
evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we
aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the
context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of
privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity
(CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot
behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices
of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and
questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between
humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a
potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies
and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential
of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.

Result: 在模拟任务中表现优于基线，并扩展到离线RL设置。

Conclusion: ECRL通过对称性利用提升了性能，适用于多种任务设置。

Abstract: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (CRL) provides a promising framework for
extracting useful structured representations from unlabeled interactions. By
pulling together state-action pairs and their corresponding future states,
while pushing apart negative pairs, CRL enables learning nontrivial policies
without manually designed rewards. In this work, we propose Equivariant CRL
(ECRL), which further structures the latent space using equivariant
constraints. By leveraging inherent symmetries in goal-conditioned manipulation
tasks, our method improves both sample efficiency and spatial generalization.
Specifically, we formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to
characterize rotation-symmetric robotic manipulation tasks, and build on this
by introducing a novel rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a
rotation-equivariant actor for Contrastive RL. Our approach consistently
outperforms strong baselines across a range of simulated tasks in both
state-based and image-based settings. Finally, we extend our method to the
offline RL setting, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple tasks.

Result: 在真实实验中平均扫描覆盖率达99%，总扫描时间比现有方法快3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了扫描效率和覆盖范围，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Panoramic RGB-D cameras are known for their ability to produce high quality
3D scene reconstructions. However, operating these cameras involves manually
selecting viewpoints and physically transporting the camera, making the
generation of a 3D model time consuming and tedious. Additionally, the process
can be challenging for novice users due to spatial constraints, such as
ensuring sufficient feature overlap between viewpoint frames. To address these
challenges, we propose a fully autonomous scan planning that generates an
efficient tour plan for environment scanning, ensuring collision-free
navigation and adequate overlap between viewpoints within the plan. Extensive
experiments conducted in both synthetic and real-world environments validate
the performance of our planner against state-of-the-art view planners. In
particular, our method achieved an average scan coverage of 99 percent in the
real-world experiment, with our approach being up to 3 times faster than
state-of-the-art planners in total scan time.

Abstract: Accurate and robust relative pose estimation is crucial for enabling
challenging Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions targeting tumbling derelict
satellites such as ESA's ENVISAT. This work presents a complete pipeline
integrating advanced computer vision techniques with adaptive nonlinear
filtering to address this challenge. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
enhanced with image preprocessing, detects structural markers (corners) from
chaser imagery, whose 2D coordinates are converted to 3D measurements using
camera modeling. These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative
dynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the
integrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF:
dynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN
measurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance,
utilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or
maneuvers online. This dual adaptation enhances robustness against both
measurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties. The performance of
the proposed adaptive integrated system is evaluated through high-fidelity
simulations using a realistic ENVISAT model, comparing estimates against ground
truth under various conditions, including measurement outages. This
comprehensive approach offers an enhanced solution for robust onboard relative
navigation, significantly advancing the capabilities required for safe
proximity operations during ADR missions.

Abstract: Like humans who rely on landmarks for orientation, autonomous robots depend
on feature-rich environments for accurate localization. In this paper, we
propose the GFM-Planner, a perception-aware trajectory planning framework based
on the geometric feature metric, which enhances LiDAR localization accuracy by
guiding the robot to avoid degraded areas. First, we derive the Geometric
Feature Metric (GFM) from the fundamental LiDAR localization problem. Next, we
design a 2D grid-based Metric Encoding Map (MEM) to efficiently store GFM
values across the environment. A constant-time decoding algorithm is further
proposed to retrieve GFM values for arbitrary poses from the MEM. Finally, we
develop a perception-aware trajectory planning algorithm that improves LiDAR
localization capabilities by guiding the robot in selecting trajectories
through feature-rich areas. Both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to actively select trajectories
that significantly enhance LiDAR localization accuracy.

Abstract: As the robotics market rapidly evolves, energy consumption has become a
critical issue, particularly restricting the application of construction
robots. To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from
the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a
bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy
conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography
(EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory
planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption
patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve
dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on
human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired
movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks,
validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method.
Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through
intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach
provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in
curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.

Abstract: Faced with complex and unstructured construction environments, wheeled and
tracked robots exhibit significant limitations in terrain adaptability and
flexibility, making it difficult to meet the requirements of autonomous
operation. Inspired by ants in nature, this paper proposes a leg configuration
design and optimization method tailored for construction scenarios, aiming to
enhance the autonomous mobility of construction robots. This paper analyzes the
full operational motion performance of the leg during both swing and stance
phases. First, based on kinematic modeling and multi-dimensional workspace
analysis, the concept of an "improved workspace" is introduced, and graphical
methods are used to optimize the leg dimensions during the swing phase.
Furthermore, a new concept of "average manipulability" is introduced based on
the velocity Jacobian matrix, and numerical solutions are applied to obtain the
leg segment ratio that maximizes manipulability. To overcome the difficulties
associated with traditional analytical methods, virtual prototype simulations
are conducted in ADAMS to explore the relationship between the robot body's
optimal flexibility and leg segment proportions. In summary, the leg segment
proportions with the best comprehensive motion performance are obtained. This
study presents the first multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework
for leg motion performance tailored for construction environments, providing a
structural design foundation for legged construction robots to achieve
autonomous mobility in complex terrains.

Abstract: In complex terrain construction environments, there are high demands for
robots to achieve both high payload capacity and mobility flexibility. As the
key load-bearing component, the optimization of robotic leg structures is of
particular importance. Therefore, this study focuses on the optimization of leg
structures for construction robots, proposing a topology optimization strategy
based on the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) variable
density method along with a structural re-design approach. The design
performance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using
ANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the
rationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the
SIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which
accounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative
calculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After
optimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\%, and the overall leg
mass decreases by 7.92\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally,
static and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg. The results
demonstrate that the optimized leg still meets structural performance
requirements, validating the feasibility of lightweight design. This research
provides robust theoretical and technical support for lightweight construction
robot design and lays a foundation for their efficient operation in complex
construction environments.

Abstract: Whole-body geometric calibration of humanoid robots using classical robot
calibration methods is a timeconsuming and experimentally burdensome task.
However, despite its significance for accurate control and simulation, it is
often overlooked in the humanoid robotics community. To address this issue, we
propose a novel practical method that utilizes a single plane, embedded force
sensors, and an admittance controller to calibrate the whole-body kinematics of
humanoids without requiring manual intervention. Given the complexity of
humanoid robots, it is crucial to generate and determine a minimal set of
optimal calibration postures. To do so, we propose a new algorithm called IROC
(Information Ranking algorithm for selecting Optimal Calibration postures).
IROC requires a pool of feasible candidate postures to build a normalized
weighted information matrix for each posture. Then, contrary to other
algorithms from the literature, IROC will determine the minimal number of
optimal postures that are to be played onto a robot for its calibration. Both
IROC and the single-plane calibration method were experimentally validated on a
TALOS humanoid robot. The total whole-body kinematics chain was calibrated
using solely 31 optimal postures with 3-point contacts on a table by the robot
gripper. In a cross-validation experiment, the average root-mean-square (RMS)
error was reduced by a factor of 2.3 compared to the manufacturer's model.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through
the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies
employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of
the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex
objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an
effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy
network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework
that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on
the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each
agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically
adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced
evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables
the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in
dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to
reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both
simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness
of our proposed approach.

Motivation: 探索图灵测试在人类-机器人交互中的适用性，以及如何评估具身机器人的智能。

Result: 参与者无法可靠区分AI与人类控制的机器人，分析揭示了影响智能感知的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究为未来交互机器人设计提供了见解，并推动了AI系统中智能评估的讨论。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long been associated to the the
challenge of effectively measuring intelligence. Even if the Turing Test was
introduced as a means of assessing a system intelligence, its relevance and
application within the field of human-robot interaction remain largely
underexplored. This study investigates the perception of intelligence in
embodied robots by performing a Turing Test within a robotic platform. A total
of 34 participants were tasked with distinguishing between AI- and
human-operated robots while engaging in two interactive tasks: an information
retrieval and a package handover. These tasks assessed the robot perception and
navigation abilities under both static and dynamic conditions. Results indicate
that participants were unable to reliably differentiate between AI- and
human-controlled robots beyond chance levels. Furthermore, analysis of
participant responses reveals key factors influencing the perception of
artificial versus human intelligence in embodied robotic systems. These
findings provide insights into the design of future interactive robots and
contribute to the ongoing discourse on intelligence assessment in AI-driven
systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种固定翼无人机编队飞行算法，无需速度控制，通过振荡行为和分布式调整实现协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定翼无人机速度受限，传统编队飞行需速度控制，难以实现。

Method: 引导无人机沿特定路径飞行，叠加振荡行为控制平均速度，分布式调整振幅。

Result: 理论分析、数值模拟和实际飞行验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 算法成功实现固定翼无人机编队飞行，无需速度控制。

Abstract: The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the
coordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically
bounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This
paper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones
without requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all
the drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we
superpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the
drones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity
along the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone
adjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by
communicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A
novel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric
saturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative
amplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along
the path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by
validation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了辅助机器人在社会协作中的设计问题，重点关注与弱势群体的互动，发现人类特征和交互范式影响机器人的可接受性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏关于不同机器人行为与多样化人类需求结合的研究，尤其是参与者对高级家用机器人的实际经验有限。

Method: 通过在线研究，112名参与者评估了28种人机协作类型，实验组在评估前完成了认知情感映射（CAM）练习。

Result: CAM反思未显著影响整体评分，但对某些机器人行为和人类条件的组合评估更明显。反社会机器人行为评分最低，与老年人协作的评估更敏感。

Conclusion: 人类特征和交互范式影响机器人可接受性，凸显亲社会设计的重要性，CAM等反思方法有助于获取细致反馈，支持开发用户中心和社会责任机器人系统。

Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和可解释性上优于现有方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being
crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for
controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive
knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in
real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable
alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of
sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and
predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the
safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages
physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier
curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive
simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our
approach over existing alternatives.

Abstract: Extrinsic Calibration represents the cornerstone of autonomous driving. Its
accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can
have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect
different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the
data. To this end, we propose a target-based extrinsic calibration system
tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables
cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using
a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test
the system with real-world data gathered in a warehouse. Results demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the feasibility of a
unique pipeline tailored for various types of sensors.

Motivation: 解决传统动画面孔在硬件和软件上的局限性，以实现更精确和多样化的情感表达。

Method: 采用混合驱动机制（刚性驱动用于眼睛和嘴，肌腱驱动用于鼻子和脸颊），并结合自建模网络和神经网络实现表情控制。

Conclusion: 混合驱动方法和算法改进显著提升了动画面孔的情感表达能力，为未来研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Previous animatronic faces struggle to express emotions effectively due to
hardware and software limitations. On the hardware side, earlier approaches
either use rigid-driven mechanisms, which provide precise control but are
difficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms,
which are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we
propose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The
eyes and mouth-key areas for emotional expression-are controlled using rigid
mechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle
facial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build
a compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of
emotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling
network that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to
automatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for
different facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals
through gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech
input to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate
distinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger,
from any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals-a
feature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems. We release the
hardware design and code at https://github.com/ZZongzheng0918/Morpheus-Hardware

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable
autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet
data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents
ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a
self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM
autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts
robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this
process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of
learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with
an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection
improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and
observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative
tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight
unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial
success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of ExpTeach.
