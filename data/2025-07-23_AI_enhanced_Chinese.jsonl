Our findings demonstrate that\nincorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,\noffering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to\nbroader social contexts and multimodal applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ebf\u7d22\u6574\u5408\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ebf\u7d22\u6574\u5408\uff08BCI\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This reliance on a\nmulti-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,\nwhich is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we\nrigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using\nConditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce\nthe Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose\nRectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces\nfactorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target\ndistributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a\nmonotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,\nReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for\ntraining efficient one-step models on image generation.

While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have\nsought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational\ninefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,\nwe present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep\nadaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video\ndiffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means\nit fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA\nWan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --\nsurpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\\leq$ 1/200 of the training\ncost (\\$500 vs. $\\geq$ \\$100,000) and $\\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.\n$\\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)\ngeneration, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\\% (vs. 86.86\\% of\nWan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as\nstart-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.\nMeanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic\nanalyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative\npriors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial\nexplosion inherent to vectorized timesteps.

The design\nperformance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using\nANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the\nrationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the\nSIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which\naccounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative\ncalculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After\noptimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\\%, and the overall leg\nmass decreases by 7.92\\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally,\nstatic and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg. The results\ndemonstrate that the optimized leg still meets structural performance\nrequirements, validating the feasibility of lightweight design. This research\nprovides robust theoretical and technical support for lightweight construction\nrobot design and lays a foundation for their efficient operation in complex\nconstruction environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSIMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u817f\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u79fb\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5bf9\u817f\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SIMP\u53d8\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ANSYS\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u817f\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u51cf\u8f7b7.92%\uff0c\u80a1\u9aa8\u90e8\u5206\u51cf\u91cd19.45%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u65bd\u5de5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

In an online study, 112\nparticipants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos\nfrom a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The\nexperimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise\non human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM\nreflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more\npronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human\ncondition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences\nthe assessment.

Existing\nmethods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,\nwhich to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.\nHowever, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization\nperformance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the\nmodel's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on\nthis, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the\npositive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and\nContinuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization\nGain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and\naccumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory\nrecognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.\nFurthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make\nfull use of positive styles.

However, existing studies focus solely on the\nrelationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully\nleveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer\nperformance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during\nthe inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality\ngraph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer\nsurvival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to\nmodel multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance\ndegradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to\nsimulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing\nscenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore\nmodality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play\nevent-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored\ndata using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate\nsurvival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data\ninto training.

Token reduction, which discards\nless important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance\nthe efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle\nunimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.\nConsidering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,\ntokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt\ntransformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a\nbalance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing\n(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and\ntemporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a\nlater stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token\nidentification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By\njointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware\nend-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each\nblock, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of\nLV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a\nbetter trade-off between performance and complexity compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToFe\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981token\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eViT\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5730\u4e22\u5f03\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981token\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5757\u4e2d\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToFe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542btoken\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3token\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "ToFe\u5c06LV-ViT\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e50%\uff0cTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52302%\u3002", "conclusion": "ToFe\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Second, we\npresent Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands\nthe contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter\nsize from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.\nOur design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields\neffective classification and discriminative state representations. We\nextensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures\nacross language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably\nwith state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B\nSSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among\nsmall reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,\nsignificantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers.

In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture\nthat leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by\nagreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by\nmatching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire\nnetwork.

Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that\ncombines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling\nneuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that\nthe brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of\nneurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the\nsame object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We\ndrew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all\nlayers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto\ndynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with\nsimilar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases.

On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack\nsufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their\npractical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery\nlocalization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and\nintegrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the\nDCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT\nfeature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much\nimproved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.\nAlso, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the\nlocalization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities.

Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it.

SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy\nbehavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable\nLVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns\noutcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.\nThen LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning\ntrajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the\neffectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in\naverage, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on\nmultiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some\nclosed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and\nOlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.\nAnalysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy\nRL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy\ntraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOPHIA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6162\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6162\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7b56\u7565RL\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3LVLM\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6162\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7b56\u7565RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SOPHIA\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002"}}

Single-image shadow\nremoval (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered\nby non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity.

To\nresolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework\nfor weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to\nidentify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.\nThe MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an\nextensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which\nachieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.\nSpecifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal\nattention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in\nthe probabilistic embedding space.

While monitoring tasks have\ntraditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made\nit possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated\nway. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space\n(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research\nof these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet\nbeen conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:\nPigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The\ndatasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn\nconditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad\nvisibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images\nimprove detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled\nimages alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art\nmodels offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time\nalternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods\nachieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.\nHowever, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they\ncould become strong alternatives in the future.

Recently, several\nworks introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.\nHowever, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the\nquality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,\nwhile only yielding modest performance improvements.

This shortcoming limits the utility for video\nsegmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object\ncategories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object\ncategory that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating\nroom video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows\nand instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning\nsegmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural\nlanguage text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.\nHowever, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain\ncontextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is\ninadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,\ndisappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as\nsurgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural\nphases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments\nduring surgery.

However, these models\ntypically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common\nlimitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire\nsynthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause\noverfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we\npropose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets\ngenerated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces\nmodel-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and\ndemographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by\nemphasizing identity-relevant features.

In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for\ncompositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while\nensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the\nbackground person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two\nkey designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes\nMLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,\nholding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated\npose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track\naction variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)\nDetail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware\nattention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background\nconsistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and\nfaithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first\ndataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.\nExperimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates\nharmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and\noutperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "HOComp\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MLLMs\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u4fdd\u6301\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cHOComp\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "HOComp\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86MLLMs\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u533a\u57df\u59ff\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\uff08MRPG\uff09\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u4fdd\u6301\uff08DCAP\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba-\u7269\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6IHOC\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHOComp\u5728IHOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u548c\u8c10\u4e14\u5916\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u91cf\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HOComp\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u4fdd\u6301\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}
