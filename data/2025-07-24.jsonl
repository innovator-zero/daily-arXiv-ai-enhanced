Such descriptions of normative driving behaviors can aid in the\ndevelopment of vehicle safety and intelligent transportation systems. The\nmethodology is demonstrated using data from the Second Strategic Highway\nResearch Program (SHRP 2) NDS, which includes over 34 million miles of driving\nacross more than 3,400 drivers. Summaries of each driving metric were generated\nusing vehicle, GPS, and forward radar data. Additionally, interactive online\nanalytics tools were developed to visualize and compare driving behavior across\ngroups through dynamic data selection and grouping. For example, among drivers\non 65-mph roads for the SHRP 2 NDS, females aged 16-19 exceeded the speed limit\nby 7.5 to 15 mph slightly more often than their male counterparts, and younger\ndrivers maintained headways under 1.5 seconds more frequently than older\ndrivers.

Traditionally,\nqueuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand\nand fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during\ncongestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a\nfactor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an\nanalytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging\nof autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the\nfirst time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the\nmulti-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed\nform formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue\nlength and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a\ncrash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential\ncollisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.\nFinally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly\nminimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision\nvariables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is\nformulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to\nfind the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset\nvalidate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the\nproposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more\nefficient and safer merging process."}

The root cause of this misalignment lies in\nprojection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and\nrolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key\ninsight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at\nobject-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.\nBased on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align\ncross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose\nPrior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct\nlocal misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve\nglobal misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)\nto process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly\nenhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries.

Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a\nsparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic\nspatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images\nto enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent\nImputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while\npreserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue\ntypes, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that\nour method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By\nenabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework\nsignificantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating\npotential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications."}

To address these questions,\nwe first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under\nwhich biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on\nthis theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically\nleverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The\nframework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and\nindirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive\ningredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the\nenvironmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware\npredictors to alleviate environment gaps.

These tools are\nnot tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive\nto how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot\nlearn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's\nlifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based\non accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide\npolicy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies\nconsistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer\neffectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of\nlearning lifespan-guided tool use strategies."}

Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance.

State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via\nvision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised\npre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to\nboost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models\nexclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to\nlearn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,\naiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data\nfor foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a\nsynergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training\nframework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge\nin combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model\nlies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.\nTo address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the\nCLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic\nspecific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for\nsemantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation\nloss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature\nspace back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With\nthis mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both\npaired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for\ndownstream tasks.

To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{PointLAMA}, a point\ncloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,\na hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a\nconditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,\nthe task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert\nspace-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens\nfor classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent\nAttention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)\nmodule, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by\nleveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This\nenables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency.

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms.

To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,\nconcerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.\nBased on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that\nexplores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more\nlikely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of\nthe verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it\nonly changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead\nto a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including\n$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that\nare more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy\ninspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to\nexploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems.

This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot\nlearn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's\nlifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based\non accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide\npolicy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools.

Project page: https://genintel.github.io/CNS", "summary": "An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is\nto evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.\nWhile simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,\nthey often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.\nRecently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for\nbenchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,\nwe introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD\nrobustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative\nnuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual\nnuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion\nmodels. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that\noutperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with\ngenerative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study\nto evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance\nshifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model\nrankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be\ncaptured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that\nevaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the\nidentification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding\nof model robustness.

However, achieving them jointly remains a\nchallenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for\nsimultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network\ncompressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce\ndesirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,\nclass separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate\nthat large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and\nregularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.\nIn addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across\ndiverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present\nstrong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates\nin standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing\nhidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset."}
