### [1] [Post-Disaster Affected Area Segmentation with a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based EVAP Model using Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16849)
*Yi-Shan Chu,Hsuan-Cheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于ViT的深度学习框架，用于从遥感图像中细化灾害影响区域分割，支持台湾太空中心开发的EVAP产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升灾害影响区域分割的准确性和可靠性，尤其是在缺乏精确地面真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用PCA特征空间分析和置信指数扩展手动标注标签，构建弱监督训练集，训练ViT编码器-解码器模型，支持多波段输入和多阶段损失策略。

Result: 在2022年鄱阳湖干旱和2023年罗得岛野火的案例中，模型提升了分割结果的平滑性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为灾害制图提供了一种可扩展的方法，尤其在缺乏精确地面真实数据时表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

### [2] [Toward a Real-Time Framework for Accurate Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16850)
*Mohamed Adjel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合实时2D关键点检测与几何感知2D到3D提升的框架，利用相机内参和解剖学先验知识，实现快速、个性化的单目3D姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D人体姿态估计在实时和无约束环境中的挑战性问题，避免直接图像到3D方法对大数据集和复杂模型的依赖。

Method: 结合实时2D关键点检测与几何感知的2D到3D提升，利用相机内参和解剖学先验知识，通过自校准和生物力学约束的逆运动学生成大规模训练数据。

Result: 实现了快速、个性化的单目3D姿态估计，无需专用硬件。

Conclusion: 通过结合数据驱动学习和模型先验知识，提高了3D人体运动捕捉在边缘设备上的准确性、可解释性和可部署性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

### [3] [Coarse-to-fine crack cue for robust crack detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16851)
*Zelong Liu,Yuliang Gu,Zhichao Sun,Huachao Zhu,Xin Xiao,Bo Du,Laurent Najman,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackCue是一种基于粗到细裂纹线索生成的新方法，通过利用裂纹的细结构特性提高检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在裂纹检测中泛化能力不足，且忽视了裂纹的细结构特性。

Method: 通过最大池化和上采样操作生成粗裂纹背景，再通过重建网络获得细裂纹背景，利用差异生成细裂纹线索。

Result: 实验表明，CrackCue显著提升了基线方法的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrackCue是一种有效的插件方法，能提升裂纹检测性能。

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

### [4] [CLAMP: Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Fusion for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16854)
*Xiaoqiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLAMP框架通过渐进注意力融合、多任务对比学习和自适应多损失聚合，解决了多模态情感分析中的跨模态对齐和细粒度表示问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中存在跨模态对齐噪声和细粒度表示一致性不足的问题，CLAMP旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: CLAMP包含渐进注意力融合网络、多任务对比学习和自适应多损失聚合模块，通过分层跨模态交互和动态损失校准提升性能。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CLAMP显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CLAMP为多模态情感分析提供了一种高效框架，解决了跨模态对齐和细粒度表示的难题。

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

### [5] [SIA: Enhancing Safety via Intent Awareness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16856)
*Youngjin Na,Sangheon Jeong,Youngwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIA框架通过意图感知提升多模态模型安全性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态输入中隐含的有害意图可能导致不安全响应，现有方法难以检测。

Method: SIA采用三阶段推理：视觉抽象、意图推断和响应优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试中表现优异，安全性显著提升。

Conclusion: 意图感知推理有助于对齐人类价值观，尽管可能轻微影响推理准确性。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

### [6] [Look Before You Fuse: 2D-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16861)
*Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用2D先验信息校正LiDAR和相机特征对齐的方法，通过PGDC和DAGF解决局部和全局对齐问题，结合SGDM实现高效特征融合，显著提升了3D感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LiDAR和相机特征融合存在投影误差导致的局部和全局对齐问题，影响深度监督和特征融合的准确性。论文利用2D检测器识别的物体边界信息，提出先验引导的校正方法。

Method: 提出PGDC（局部对齐校正）和DAGF（全局对齐校正），结合SGDM（门控注意力机制）实现高效特征融合。

Result: 在nuScenes验证集上达到mAP 71.5%和NDS 73.6%，性能领先。

Conclusion: 通过2D先验引导的特征对齐和高效融合方法，显著提升了多模态感知的准确性。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

*Hongcheng Gao,Zihao Huang,Lin Xu,Jingyi Tang,Xinhao Li,Yue Liu,Haoyang Li,Taihang Hu,Minhua Lin,Xinlong Yang,Ge Wu,Balong Bi,Hongyu Chen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Turing Eye Test (TET)的感知导向基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的感知能力，发现当前模型在人类直觉处理的任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MLLMs是否具备人类般的感知能力，而非仅关注推理能力。

Method: 设计了包含四项诊断任务的TET基准测试，使用合成图像评估MLLMs的感知表现。

Result: 当前最先进的MLLMs在感知任务上表现极差，微调视觉模块能提升性能，但语言模块的知识和推理能力无法弥补感知差距。

Conclusion: TET揭示了MLLMs在感知能力上与人类的差距，未来需更多任务和方法提升视觉泛化能力。

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

### [8] [HIPPO-Video: Simulating Watch Histories with Large Language Models for Personalized Video Highlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16873)
*Jeongeun Lee,Youngjae Yu,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIPPO-Video数据集和HiPHer方法为个性化视频高亮任务提供了新解决方案，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容爆炸式增长，用户偏好复杂多变，现有数据集缺乏个性化，无法捕捉用户行为细节。

Method: 使用LLM模拟用户生成真实观看历史，构建HIPPO-Video数据集；提出HiPHer方法，利用个性化历史预测视频片段显著性。

Result: HIPPO-Video包含2040对数据，覆盖20400个视频和170个类别；HiPHer在实验中优于通用和基于查询的方法。

Conclusion: HIPPO-Video和HiPHer为个性化视频高亮提供了有效工具，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.

### [9] [ReMeREC: Relation-aware and Multi-entity Referring Expression Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16877)
*Yizhi Hu,Zezhao Tian,Xingqun Qi,Chen Su,Bingkun Yang,Junhui Yin,Muyi Sun,Man Zhang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMeREC框架通过构建关系感知的多实体数据集ReMeX，结合视觉和文本线索，解决了多实体场景中的关系建模问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多实体场景中忽略实体间复杂关系，且缺乏高质量数据集，限制了准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReMeREC框架，包括Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron（TMP）动态推断实体数量和范围，以及Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner（EIR）增强关系推理。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ReMeREC在多实体定位和关系预测中表现最优，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ReMeREC通过关系建模和动态推断，显著提升了多实体场景下的指代表达理解能力。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

### [10] [CausalStep: A Benchmark for Explicit Stepwise Causal Reasoning in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16878)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalStep是一个新的视频推理基准，专注于逐步因果推理，通过严格的QA协议和诊断指标评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准主要评估浅层理解和推理，无法严格评估真正的因果和逐步推理能力。

Method: CausalStep将视频分割为因果链接单元，采用逐步QA协议，包含精心设计的干扰项和诊断指标。

Result: 实验显示当前模型与人类逐步推理能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: CausalStep为视频推理提供了严格的基准，推动稳健和可解释的推理研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于剪枝的防御方法在文本到图像扩散模型中效果有限，即使剪枝后仍可通过调整文本嵌入重新触发数据复制。作者提出了一种新的对抗性微调方法以提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估现有基于剪枝的防御方法的有效性，并探讨记忆化在扩散模型中的本质，以推动更可靠的生成AI发展。

Method: 通过实验证明剪枝方法的脆弱性，并提出一种迭代搜索复制触发点并通过对抗性微调更新模型的新方法。

Result: 研究发现记忆化并非局部化，复制可通过文本嵌入空间的不同位置触发，现有防御策略不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要真正移除记忆内容的方法，而非抑制其检索，并提出了对抗性微调作为初步解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

Motivation: 高分辨率ST数据成本高且稀缺，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 结合稀疏到稀疏自监督学习、跨域联合学习和级联数据一致性填补网络（CDCIN）。

Result: 在多种组织类型中表现优于现有方法，填补准确性更高。

Conclusion: S2S-ST框架减少了对高成本高分辨率数据的依赖，有望推动ST在生物医学研究和临床中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

Conclusion: AURA为医学影像分析提供了交互式决策支持的新范式，推动了AI在医疗领域的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced
state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual
interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种长尾在线异常检测（LTOAD）方法，解决了现有离线方法无法直接应用于在线设置的问题，并在多个领域取得了优于现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长尾异常检测（LTAD）方法需要类别标签，无法直接应用于在线设置，因此需要一种新的类无关框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种类无关的长尾异常检测框架，并将其适应于在线学习设置。

Result: 在离线LTAD设置中表现优于现有方法，特别是在工业制造和医疗领域；在最具挑战性的长尾在线设置中，AUROC提升了0.53%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的LTOAD方法在无需类别标签的情况下，显著提升了异常检测的性能，并发布了相关基准数据集。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注真实类的CAM，忽略了虚假类的CAM。作者假设在二元任务中，真实类和虚假类的CAM应在人类识别的重要特征上有所差异，从而提出新方法。

Method: 提出了三种新的显著性引导训练方法，结合真实类和虚假类的CAM，并开发了一种新的后处理工具用于识别重要特征。

Conclusion: 新方法优于传统仅使用真实类CAM的方法，提供了源代码和模型权重以支持可重复研究。

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

Motivation: 解决手语手形数据集小而失衡的问题，提升分类器性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据生成有效解决了小数据集的限制，且无需重新训练生成器即可泛化。

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

Result: Decoupled-PolyGCN在AP和AR上分别优于现有方法6%和10%。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市规划、灾害管理等提供了可扩展且精确的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视频字幕生成器和大型语言模型的方法，通过文本摘要和静态场景描述增强视频内容的理解和查询能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频数据高维且密集，文本摘要能更紧凑地表示相关内容，便于大型语言模型处理复杂查询。

Method: 使用视频字幕生成器分段处理视频，结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）增强静态场景描述，并优化视频分割和字幕生成流程。

Result: 成功微调了LaViLa视频字幕生成器，生成更详细的动作和场景描述，提高了字幕生成效率。

Conclusion: 可控混合字幕生成器能根据视频场景变化切换字幕类型，显著提升了视频内容的理解和查询能力。

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

TL;DR: VideoNarrator是一种无需训练的新方法，通过结合多模态大语言模型和视觉语言模型，生成时间对齐的密集视频描述，减少幻觉并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在时间对齐描述和陌生场景中容易产生幻觉，VideoNarrator旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用现成的多模态大语言模型和视觉语言模型作为描述生成器、上下文提供者和描述验证器，通过协同工作提升效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了视频描述的质量和准确性，减少了幻觉并改善了时间对齐。

Conclusion: VideoNarrator不仅提升了视频理解能力，还可应用于视频摘要、问答及广告营销等领域。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少昂贵的手动数据标注需求，尤其是在视频和3D物体检测中。

Method: 通过跨帧信息传播（如tube proposals和时序匹配网络）和点云网络与损失函数的结合。

Result: FSL在视频和3D检测中表现出色，能够高效利用时空结构和处理数据稀疏性。

Conclusion: FSL在减少监督需求和实际应用中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有方法多为单模态，相机方法缺乏深度信息，LiDAR方法受限于遮挡问题，且轻量级方法依赖LSS管道，深度估计不准确。

Method: SDG-OCC通过联合语义和深度引导的视图变换，以及融合到占用驱动的主动蒸馏，优化深度分布和语义信息提取。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上实现SOTA性能，并在SurroundOcc-nuScenes数据集上表现可比。

Conclusion: SDG-OCC展示了多模态融合和蒸馏的有效性，具有实时性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

Result: 在RLAIF-V数据集上，pLoRA比标准LoRA提高了24.5%的客户端特定性能。

Conclusion: FedVLM为联邦环境下的VLM微调提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，推动了分布式学习中的个性化适应。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each
client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation
while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard
LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a
scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning VLMs in federated settings,
advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios.

Motivation: Transformer在惯性里程计中表现优异，但对局部运动变化不敏感且缺乏归纳偏置，限制了定位精度和泛化能力。

Method: 提出DADM模块自适应捕获全局和局部运动特征，STGU单元改进时间建模，构建了IONext模型。

Conclusion: IONext通过结合DADM和STGU，显著提升了惯性里程计的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced

Conclusion: ScSAM通过多特征融合和类别提示，显著提升了细胞器分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Result: UNICE在跨任务和任务内均表现出更强的泛化性能，甚至优于人工标注的基准。

Conclusion: UNICE是一种高效、通用的图像对比度增强方法，无需人工标注，性能优越。

Abstract: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

Conclusion: DOOMGAN填补了可见光谱眼部形态攻击研究的空白，并发布了首个相关数据集。

Abstract: Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.

Motivation: 传统PCB缺陷检测模型难以兼顾高精度和低计算成本，无法满足微小缺陷的高精度实时检测需求。

Method: 采用Ghost-HGNetv2结构、C2f-Faster模块、GCDetect检测头和Inner-MPDIoU损失函数，并结合自适应剪枝策略。

Result: 在公开PCB缺陷数据集上，mAP0.5达99.32%，mAP0.5:0.9达75.18%，比YOLOv8n提高10.13%。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和速度上均表现出显著优势，适用于高密度PCB的实时缺陷检测。

Abstract: With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单级视觉特征，难以捕捉AI生成内容中的复杂失真，因此需要一种多级视觉表示方法。

Result: 在基准测试中表现出色，验证了多级视觉评估范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 多级视觉表示范式能有效提升AI生成内容的质量评估能力。

Abstract: The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.

Motivation: 皮肤病变的形状不对称性是诊断黑色素瘤的重要标准，但非专家难以准确评估。

Method: 结合几何分析算法和预训练的CNN提取特征，训练多类SVM分类器。

Result: 几何实验检测率达99%，CNN实验在分类病变形状时表现优异（Kappa Score 94%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测皮肤病变不对称性方面优于现有方法，有助于辅助诊断。

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

*Haiyu Wu,Jaskirat Singh,Sicong Tian,Liang Zheng,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vec2Face+是一种生成模型，通过控制特征和属性生成高质量人脸数据，首次在合成数据上超越真实数据集CASIA-WebFace的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在增加类内属性变化时忽略了保持类内身份一致性的必要性，Vec2Face+旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Vec2Face+模型，采用三种策略：生成分离良好的身份、AttrOP算法增加属性变化、LoRA-based姿态控制。

Result: 生成的VFace10K数据集在7个真实测试集上达到SOTA准确率，更大规模的VFace100K和VFace300K超越CASIA-WebFace。

Conclusion: 合成数据集首次超越真实数据集，但存在偏见问题，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation.

Motivation: 非专家在设计高质量幻灯片时面临复杂选择，现有工具缺乏自我优化能力。

Method: 将设计过程分为评审者和贡献者角色，通过迭代循环和语言模型微调优化设计。

Result: DesignLab在实验中表现优于现有设计生成方法，包括商业工具。

Conclusion: DesignLab通过迭代设计过程，能够生成更专业的幻灯片。

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.

Conclusion: VBCD为个性化牙冠设计提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD
framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral
scans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware
supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a
large-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach
outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized
dental crown design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统木材识别方法依赖人工，效率低且易出错，需要一种自动化、经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用YOLOv5算法，在公开数据集TimberSeg 1.0上微调，通过边界框尺寸估算木材厚度。

Result: 模型在mAP@0.5指标上达到0.64，表现可靠且计算资源需求低。

Conclusion: 该方法适合中小型木材加工厂，可集成到现有工作流程中，提升效率。

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.

Conclusion: PIG-Nav在预训练视觉导航模型中达到先进水平，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.

Motivation: 现有方法仅利用配对或非配对图像数据学习基础模型，限制了特征的丰富性和全面性。

Method: 提出MaskedCLIP框架，结合掩码图像建模和对比语言-图像预训练，通过桥接变换器和掩码知识蒸馏损失整合两种数据特征。

Result: 在视网膜图像分析任务中验证了方法的有效性和数据效率。

Conclusion: MaskedCLIP能够更全面地利用数据，学习更具泛化性的图像特征。

Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.

Method: 利用IQA模型的特征空间训练双层网络，评估其在检测AI生成图像任务中的泛化能力及对图像退化的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法在检测不同生成模型的假图像上表现优异，且对图像退化具有显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IQA模型的特征空间为检测AI生成图像提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.

Motivation: 现有曝光校正方法需要大量人工标注数据，泛化能力有限，且在低层视觉任务中性能下降。

Method: 利用模拟ISP管道的自由配对数据训练模型，提出保留图像细节的转换函数，并构建大规模放射校正数据集。

Result: UEC方法在性能上优于现有监督方法，仅使用0.01%的参数，并在下游任务（如边缘检测）中表现优异。

Conclusion: UEC方法解决了现有方法的局限性，为无监督曝光校正提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods
[12], while utilizing only 0.01% of their parameters. Our work further
investigates the broader impact of exposure correction on downstream tasks,
including edge detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the
adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features. The source code and
dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/BeyondHeaven/uec_code.

Motivation: 传统检索方法难以扩展且易受感知混淆影响，分类方法缺乏泛化性且需大量训练数据，而VLM虽准确但易产生幻觉且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 先利用VLM生成地理先验以缩小检索范围，再通过检索和重排序机制选择最可能的地理匹配。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，街道和城市级别的精度分别提升4.51%和13.52%。

Conclusion: VLM生成的地理先验与VPR结合，实现了可扩展、鲁棒且准确的地理定位系统。

Abstract: Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注VQA模型对可回答问题的处理，但对无法回答问题的情况研究较少，尤其是模型应避免回答的情况。

Method: 通过生成不现实的图像或提出无法回答的问题，评估模型是否能识别其知识局限。数据集VisionTrap包含三类无法回答的问题。

Result: 研究发现，模型在面对无法回答的问题时，往往会尝试生成错误答案，而非识别其局限。

Conclusion: 建议将此类问题纳入VQA基准测试，以评估模型是否会在应避免回答时仍尝试回答。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.

Conclusion: PolarAnything 通过单张 RGB 输入合成偏振图像，兼具逼真性和物理准确性，解决了 3D 资产依赖问题。

Abstract: Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.

Motivation: SAM在医学图像分割中依赖专家标注提示且易受错误提示影响，限制了其临床应用。

Method: FA-SAM引入自动提示生成模型（AGM）和图像-提示嵌入融合模块（IPEF），分别生成目标域提示和优化分割结果。

Result: 在公开的前列腺和眼底血管数据集上验证了FA-SAM的有效性。

Conclusion: FA-SAM能够实现完全自动化的医学图像分割，并减少错误提示的影响。

Abstract: Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶模型依赖LiDAR和计算密集的BEV表示，限制了其在仅配备摄像头的量产车上的应用。

Method: 提出PRIX架构，结合视觉特征提取器和生成规划头，并引入Context-aware Recalibration Transformer（CaRT）增强特征。

Result: 在NavSim和nuScenes基准测试中达到SOTA性能，推理速度和模型效率显著优于多模态扩散规划器。

Conclusion: PRIX为实际部署提供高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching

*Xuanyu Lin,Xiaona Zeng,Xianwei Zheng,Xutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointLAMA结合任务感知的点云序列化、混合编码器和条件扩散机制，解决了Mamba在点云建模中缺乏局部归纳偏置的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为点云建模的骨干模型，因其缺乏局部归纳偏置而难以捕捉细粒度几何结构。

Method: 提出任务感知的点云序列化、混合编码器（Latent Attention和Mamba块）和条件扩散机制。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，参数和计算量少。

Conclusion: PointLAMA是一种高效的点云预训练框架。

Abstract: Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架MonoMRN，通过分解任务和引入MS-GRU及距离注意力投影，显著提升了单目语义场景补全的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单阶段方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，且受深度估计误差影响。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：粗粒度MSSC和掩膜循环网络（MS-GRU），结合距离注意力投影减少投影误差。

Result: 在NYUv2和SemanticKITTI数据集上达到SOTA，且对干扰具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MonoMRN通过任务分解和注意力机制，有效提升了单目语义场景补全的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.

Motivation: 传统监控方法依赖多传感器或复杂硬件，成本高且难以动态实施。

Method: 集成多机器学习模型，利用相同时间戳的状态信息进行装配阶段检测。

Result: 平均精度超92%，提供实时错误检测和可视化指导。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、经济，适合现代工业应用。

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.

Conclusion: Talk2Event数据集和方法为多模态、时序感知和语言驱动的感知研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,
making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these
asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce
Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object
grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we
provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four
grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to
other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully
exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding
framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a
Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different
modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art
baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope
our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,
temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and
autonomy.

Result: 在1152分辨率下速度提升2.2倍，且在几何估计和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CasP在延迟敏感和高鲁棒性应用中具有潜力，如SLAM和无人机系统。

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

Abstract: With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered
significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets
and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other
autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,
the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations
collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby
facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well
as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel
cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the
well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves
perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric
and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the
resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,
providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging
cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation
methods. We hope this work paves the way for generalizable and unified 3D
perception systems across diverse and complex environments. Our Pi3DET dataset,
cross-platform benchmark suite, and annotation toolkit have been made publicly

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual
character animation. The project homepage is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体重建方法未充分利用部位分割先验，导致纹理不对齐。

Method: 提出PartSegmenter预测部位标签，PartTexturer利用部位信息重建纹理。

Result: 实验表明PARTE在3D人体重建中达到最优质量。

Conclusion: PARTE通过部位信息显著提升了纹理对齐效果。

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在弱目标检测中因特征提取困难和缺乏可靠标注而表现不佳。

Method: 将任务重新定义为像素级时序信号建模问题，开发了TSRNet网络，结合动态多尺度注意力模块和图轨迹挖掘策略。

Result: 在低信噪比数据集上表现优于现有方法，检测速度超过1000 FPS。

Conclusion: TPS框架在无标注条件下实现了高性能实时检测，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.

Result: 在Argoverse 2、nuScenes等基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DeMo++能全面建模运动多样性与时空演化，显著提升自动驾驶系统的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Motivation: 传统方法依赖锚点模态且不稳定，PMRL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PMRL通过优化Gram矩阵的秩1特性，提出基于softmax的损失函数和对比正则化。

Conclusion: PMRL为多模态表示学习提供了稳定且高效的新框架。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for
assembling lightweight food image.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,
achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random

Abstract: The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all
state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic
segmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的源自由未知物体检测（SFUOD）场景，并提出了CollaPAUL框架，通过协作调优和基于主轴的未知标记方法，实现了在目标域中检测未知物体的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统源自由物体检测中仅能检测预定义物体的限制，扩展至未知物体的检测。

Method: 提出CollaPAUL框架，结合协作调优和基于主轴的未知标记方法，通过跨域注意力机制和伪标签分配实现。

Result: 在SFUOD基准测试中达到最先进性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CollaPAUL框架成功解决了源自由未知物体检测的问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统方法将属性和对象视为独立实体，忽略了组合中的语义约束和上下文依赖。论文旨在解决这一长期被忽视的挑战。

Method: 采用条件概率框架（CPF），分解组合概率为对象似然和条件属性似然，结合文本描述增强对象特征学习，并通过跨注意力机制优化属性学习。

Result: 在多个CZSL基准测试中表现出优越性，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模属性与对象的依赖关系，该方法显著提升了组合零样本学习的性能，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code
is available at here.

Conclusion: EndoGen框架有效解决了动态生成和条件引导问题，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法计算量大且依赖标注数据，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出动态层显著性探测（DLSP）机制，提取MLLMs中间层的信息丰富隐藏状态，结合轻量级评分器定位异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上表现优于现有方法，并展示跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: HiProbe-VAD为视频异常检测提供了更实用和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

Motivation: 现有方法在欧几里得空间中存在几何失真问题，无法充分捕捉视频的层次结构，导致时间建模效果不佳。

Method: HLFormer结合了洛伦兹注意力块和欧几里得注意力块，在混合空间中编码视频嵌入，并通过均值引导的自适应交互模块动态融合特征。

Result: 实验表明，HLFormer在性能上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间建模能够有效弥补欧几里得空间在层次建模上的不足，提升部分相关视频检索的效果。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在非平坦地面或相机移动时表现不佳，且缺乏真实世界数据的评估。

Result: PhysDynPose在动态相机和非平面环境中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新数据集和方法为动态场景下的人体姿态跟踪提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.

Motivation: 医学图像数量激增，但现有CBIR系统缺乏标准化评估和全面研究，难以满足临床需求。

Result: C-MIR在结肠和肺部肿瘤标志中表现显著提升（p<0.05），并展示了在肿瘤分期中的潜力。

Conclusion: C-MIR为医学图像检索提供了高效解决方案，有望改善临床诊断流程。

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.

Conclusion: CAPRI-CT为设计更高效的CT协议提供了可操作的见解，减少了重复扫描的需求。

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

Conclusion: MoE架构在小型实时目标检测器中具有潜力，Dynamic-DINO展示了其高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.

Motivation: 现有HOI方法依赖大量人工标注数据，成本高且难以扩展，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）的潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 结合文本和视觉交互表示，通过多模态注册表和创新的交互签名增强语义对齐，并采用多头注意力机制自适应加权特征。

Result: DYSCO在无需训练的方法中表现最优，且与基于训练的方法竞争，尤其在罕见交互中表现突出。

Conclusion: DYSCO展示了无需训练方法在HOI检测中的潜力，尤其在语义对齐和罕见交互处理上具有优势。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人模仿学习依赖4D多视角序列图像，但数据收集成本高且高质量数据稀缺，限制了VLA模型的泛化和应用。

Method: ERMV通过EMA-Attn机制、稀疏STT模块和反馈干预机制，分别解决运动模糊一致性、计算成本高和错误积累问题。

Result: 实验表明，ERMV增强的数据显著提升了VLA模型在模拟和真实环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ERMV为4D多视角数据编辑提供了一种高效解决方案，推动了机器人模仿学习的发展。

Abstract: Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

Conclusion: SRMambaV2在自动驾驶稀疏点云上采样任务中具有高效性和实用价值。

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Motivation: 夜间摄影中强光源产生的光晕会降低图像质量并影响下游任务性能，现有方法难以处理大范围光晕和光源附近的结构损伤。

Method: 提出动态频域引导去光晕网络（DFDNet），包含全局动态频域引导模块（GDFG）和局部细节引导模块（LDGM），通过频域分离光晕与内容信息，并结合对比学习修复局部细节。

Result: 实验表明，DFDNet在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DFDNet通过频域和局部细节的双重引导，显著提升了光晕去除和图像修复的效果。

Abstract: Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

Abstract: Automated X-ray inspection is crucial for efficient and unobtrusive security
screening in various public settings. However, challenges such as object
occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray
scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable
detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field,
reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently
conflicting outcomes. To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate
further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation
of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is
conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed,
composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for
X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and
PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering
all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and
time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and
computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads
to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and
computational complexity analysis. To support reproducibility of the reported
experimental results, the evaluation code and model weights are made publicly

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在实时部署时需要多加速器并行，但并行推理引入大量通信开销，影响效率和可扩展性。

Method: 提出CompactFusion框架，利用残差压缩技术仅传输激活差异，减少冗余数据，并结合轻量级误差反馈防止误差累积。

Result: 在4xL20上实现3.0倍加速，显著提升生成质量；在慢速网络上支持序列并行，实现6.7倍加速。

Conclusion: CompactFusion为并行扩散推理提供了新范式，广泛适用于各种扩散模型和并行设置，且易于集成。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

TL;DR: URPO框架将奖励模型与策略模型统一，通过单一训练阶段提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中分离的奖励模型和策略模型导致资源消耗大且性能受限。

Method: 提出URPO框架，使用GRPO循环统一训练奖励和策略模型。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B模型上，URPO显著提升了指令跟随和推理能力。

Conclusion: URPO简化了训练流程，提高了模型性能和效率。

Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.

Method: 包括基于重新着色的运动补偿模块、通道感知时间注意力模块、高斯引导邻域特征聚合模块和基于皮尔逊相关系数的联合损失函数。

Result: 在G-PCC测试模型中，STQE在delta PSNR上提升了0.855 dB、0.682 dB和0.828 dB，BD-rate分别降低了-25.2%、-31.6%和-32.5%。

Conclusion: STQE通过多模块协同工作，显著提升了压缩动态点云的视觉质量。

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%
for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

Result: 在多种判别和生成任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMPT通过多任务学习提升了点云理解的性能，具有可扩展性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

Result: 方法在计算成本更低的情况下，优于现有对抗攻击方法。

Conclusion: HAAD和HAAD-KV为保护私有内容提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.

Motivation: 硬标签攻击仅能获取模型的Top-1预测标签，现有方法通过梯度估计减少查询次数，但梯度估计质量有待提升。

Method: 利用来自替代模型的迁移先验，通过近似真实梯度在由先验和随机方向张成的子空间上的投影，高效地整合先验信息。

Result: 在ImageNet和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，该方法在查询效率上显著优于11种现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了先验引导方法在提升硬标签攻击效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

Result: 在Multi30K数据集上，D2P-MMT优于现有方法。

Conclusion: D2P-MMT通过过滤噪声和模态对齐，显著提升了翻译性能和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建和跟踪精度上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RemixFusion通过混合表示和优化策略，实现了高质量、高效的在线大规模场景重建。

Abstract: The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.

Result: 模型能够生成新颖视角的RGB和LiDAR渲染，支持重光照、夜间模拟和动态对象插入，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InvRGB+L通过结合LiDAR强度信息，显著提升了逆渲染和LiDAR模拟的效果。

Abstract: We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR
material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR
renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night
simulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass
current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering
and LiDAR simulation.

Motivation: 探索ViT注意力机制与人类视觉注意力模式的匹配程度，特别是在美学评估中。

Method: 通过眼动追踪实验记录人类视觉注意力，并与预训练的ViT模型生成的注意力图进行比较，使用Kullback-Leibler散度分析。

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

Abstract: Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct
pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can drive
substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

Abstract: An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

TL;DR: 将注意力矩阵解释为离散时间马尔可夫链，提出间接注意力传播和TokenRank，提升零样本分割和无条件图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一解释注意力矩阵的常见操作（如选择、求和、平均），并扩展至间接注意力传播，弥补以往仅建模直接效应的不足。

Method: 将注意力矩阵视为马尔可夫链，通过矩阵乘法和特征分析计算语义相似区域的稳定状态（metastable states）及其普遍性。

Result: 在零样本分割任务中达到SOTA，TokenRank（马尔可夫链稳态向量）提升了无条件图像生成效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉Transformer中的注意力机制提供了新视角，揭示了语义相似区域的稳定性和噪声注意力的分散性。

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在KBVQA中依赖单一证据，导致推理不全面。受‘见树又见林’启发，提出多维度证据融合框架。

Method: 生成并融合三种互补证据流：整体证据（场景感知）、结构证据（关键对象识别）和因果证据（反事实验证）。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA等基准测试中达到新SOTA，并展示出强大的即插即用能力。

Conclusion: 方法论设计优于模型规模，多维度证据融合显著提升推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）在理解复杂交通场景方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，可能影响自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Method: 系统评估了三种VLMs在Waymo Open Dataset中的多样化交通场景中的表现。

Result: VLMs能理解复杂图像细节，但仍会虚构元素，需要幻觉检测策略。

Conclusion: 提出BetterCheck策略以检测VLMs的幻觉问题，提升自动驾驶感知系统的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

Abstract: Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.

we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion
Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an
autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise
control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic
optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the
high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves
remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and

Result: 在1024分辨率下实现高效3D生成，速度提升6.7倍，且视觉保真度和用户偏好达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Ultra3D在保持质量的同时显著提升了稀疏体素建模的效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

Motivation: 假肢接受腔的质量依赖技师技能，手动适配缺乏标准化，AI可帮助解决这一问题。

Method: 收集118名患者数据，预处理后使用3D神经网络、前馈神经网络和随机森林预测接受腔形状或修整。

Result: 随机森林预测修整的误差最低，中位表面距离1.24毫米。

Conclusion: AI可有效标准化假肢设计，预测修整比直接预测更准确。

Abstract: The quality of a transtibial prosthetic socket depends on the prosthetist's
skills and expertise, as the fitting is performed manually. This study
investigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help
standardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were
collected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data
consists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a
corresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data
pre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and
optionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.
Afterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural
network, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final
socket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the
socket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's
performance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the
AI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.
First, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface
error between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.
Second, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are
utilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the
required adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.
The random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest
error with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first
quartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.

Conclusion: 研究不仅展示了噪声、有限数据和不同特征分布下的数据恢复框架，还为材料数据集中的kNN插补提供了基准。

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence,
with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making
in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in
enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term
rewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks
due to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state
representations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer
architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these
challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic
Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages
hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present
theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that
include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL
with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by
(32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by
(16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in
reinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that
involve hierarchical structures.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware
reinforcement learning algorithm for intelligent operation of multi-microgrid
systems. With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system
complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time
energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a
diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable
adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon
emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a
denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and
enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid
environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms
classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower
operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of
its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results
highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible
design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and
objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.

Conclusion: CPE方法有效解决了高斯噪声带来的问题，提升了模型的可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Probabilistic encoding introduces Gaussian noise into neural networks,
enabling a smooth transition from deterministic to uncertain states and
enhancing generalization ability. However, the randomness of Gaussian noise
distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE)
method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning.
Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First,
we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations,
ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification
tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance
regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2
regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is
model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification
tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and
generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.

TL;DR: SplitMeanFlow提出了一种新的代数一致性训练框架，用于高效学习平均速度场，显著提升了生成模型的采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Flow Matching方法在采样过程中计算成本高，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过利用定积分的可加性，提出了Interval Splitting Consistency代数一致性原则，并基于此设计了SplitMeanFlow框架。

Result: SplitMeanFlow在语音合成产品中实现了20倍的加速。

Conclusion: SplitMeanFlow为学习平均速度场提供了更通用、高效的基础，且在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art
performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative
sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or
one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps
noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by
enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous
velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a
limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first
principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite
integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term
Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential
relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals
without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we
introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic
consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the
differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit
of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This
establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning
average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is
significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,
resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware
compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been
successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as
Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.

Motivation: 量化可以降低推理延迟、模型大小和能耗，但现有方法在保持精度和兼容性方面存在挑战。

Result: 在多个现代基准测试中大幅领先现有方法，适用于基础和指令模型变体。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，通用性强，为量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency,
model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience
at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss
of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring
mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we
demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that,
with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms
the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern
benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily
generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to
activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional
operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人机共享学习和决策，提升运动障碍者的移动性和自主性。

Method: 采用HRL框架，将外骨骼控制任务分解为高层地形策略适应和低层预测信息生成，利用通用价值函数（GVFs）持续学习。

Result: GVFs的预测信息提高了网络整体准确性，尤其在易误判地形（如不平地面、坡道和转弯）上表现更佳。

Conclusion: 预测信息有助于决策不确定性，为HRL和外骨骼未来发展提供了新见解。

Abstract: Rehabilitation technology is a natural setting to study the shared learning
and decision-making of human and machine agents. In this work, we explore the
use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control
strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy
for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of
biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down
the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level
framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for
providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the
continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal
abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors,
including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated
two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy
network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control
system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As
a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs
increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were
seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns,
terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This
suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during
uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified.
This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the
future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and
traversing across different walking environments.

Conclusion: 合理利用偏差特征可以提升模型在OOD领域的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Most existing methods for adapting models to out-of-distribution (OOD)
domains rely on invariant representation learning to eliminate the influence of
biased features. However, should bias always be eliminated -- and if not, when
should it be retained, and how can it be leveraged? To address these questions,
we first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under
which biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on
this theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically
leverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The
framework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and
indirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive
ingredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the
environmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware
predictors to alleviate environment gaps. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic datasets and standard domain generalization
benchmarks. Results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, underscoring its robustness and adaptability.

This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with
fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series,
marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to
convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel
application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic
understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model.
The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the
complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results
confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting
model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets.
This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using

Conclusion: 方法通过强PDE约束提升准确性，且计算效率高，适用于广泛科学和工程应用。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification and inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) are central to a wide range of scientific and
engineering applications. In this second part of a two part series, we extend
Bilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) for PDE-constrained optimization
problems developed in Part 1 to the Bayesian inference framework. At the lower
level, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by
minimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural
network. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior
distribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with
existing methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the
challenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights
and does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network
solution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the
PDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method
improves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty
quantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC
sampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact
minimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between
the tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the
resulting uncertainty quantification. Through numerical experiments across a
variety of PDE models, we demonstrate that our method delivers accurate
inference and quantification of uncertainties while maintaining high
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释且可靠的离线强化学习替代方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal
policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability
and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains.
Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL
policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to
large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when
using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from
the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an
interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which
is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural
grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures
interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered
controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable
off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development
standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical
judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid
arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this
framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives
to those obtained via offline RL.

Motivation: 在低数据环境下，传统生成模型容易过拟合或泄露敏感信息，而基于上下文学习的基础模型虽然避免了重新训练，但可能直接复制种子数据，带来新的隐私风险。

Method: 通过基准测试比较了三种基础模型（GPT-4o-mini、LLaMA 3.3 70B、TabPFN v2）和四种基线模型在35个真实表格数据上的表现，评估了统计保真度、下游实用性和成员推断泄露。

Conclusion: 论文为在低数据环境下安全使用基础模型生成合成数据提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows,
especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models
(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of
examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic
data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent
retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows
via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no
parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,
introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity
of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a
person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three
foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four
baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate
statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.
Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.
LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at
1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly
vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and
GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three
zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary
statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up
to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a
practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated
its applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare,
energy optimization, and autonomous driving. However, a critical question
remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While
existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation
enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap
regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios
specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based
defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances
the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our
ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213%
increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82%
decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all

Result: KD方法在准确率和F1分数上分别提升了18%和15%，优于DRCA和KD-DRCA。

Conclusion: KD首次应用于电子鼻漂移补偿，显著提升了真实环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the
performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world
deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset
reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical
experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing
class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift
compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation
tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to
predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and
predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous
training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three
methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark
method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method
KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed
that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18%
improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior
effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for
electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift
compensation in real-world environments.

Conclusion: ZORMS-LfD是一种高效且通用的方法，特别适用于连续时间约束问题，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations
(ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of
constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to
be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the
learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order
methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs,
constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls
and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time,
with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention.
We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across
a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark
problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art
first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On
constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized
state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used
gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.

Conclusion: RL通过聚焦小部分子网络适应模型，为高效RL方法提供新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large
language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is
often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's
parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL
fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of
weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced
parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity
constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,
Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show
substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far
exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the
pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers
full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully
fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL
operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted
changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited
effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts
models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,
consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods
and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine learning that uses
probability distributions to describe the world, make predictions, and support
decision-making under uncertainty. Underlying this modeling framework is an
elegant body of theory that bridges two mathematical traditions: probability
and graph theory. This framework provides compact yet expressive
representations of joint probability distributions, yielding powerful
generative models for probabilistic reasoning.
  This tutorial provides a concise introduction to the formalisms, methods, and
applications of this modeling framework. After a review of basic probability
and graph theory, we explore three dominant themes: (1) the representation of
multivariate distributions in the intuitive visual language of graphs, (2)
algorithms for learning model parameters and graphical structures from data,
and (3) algorithms for inference, both exact and approximate.

Abstract: The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, is crucial for
effective containment and treatment, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. This study presents an AI-driven diagnostic tool developed for
deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, leveraging the pre-trained
MobileNetV2 architecture for binary classification. The model was trained on
the open-source Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset, achieving a 93.07% F1-Score,
which reflects a well-balanced performance in precision and recall. To optimize
the model, the TensorRT framework was used to accelerate inference for FP32 and
to perform post-training quantization for FP16 and INT8 formats. TensorRT's
mixed-precision capabilities enabled these optimizations, which reduced the
model size, increased inference speed, and lowered power consumption by
approximately a factor of two, all while maintaining the original accuracy.
Power consumption analysis confirmed that the optimized models used
significantly less energy during inference, reinforcing their suitability for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. The system was deployed with a
Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) hotspot and a web-based interface, enabling users to
upload and analyze images directly through connected devices such as mobile
phones. This setup ensures simple access and seamless connectivity, making the
tool practical for real-world applications. These advancements position the
diagnostic tool as an efficient, scalable, and energy-conscious solution to
address diagnosis challenges in underserved regions, paving the way for broader
adoption in low-resource healthcare settings.

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and preventable types of cancer, yet
its early detection remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited
settings where access to specialized healthcare is scarce. This study proposes
an AI-driven diagnostic tool optimized for embedded systems to address this
gap. Using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture, the model was
adapted for binary classification of skin lesions into "Skin Cancer" and
"Other." The TensorRT framework was employed to compress and optimize the model
for deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, balancing performance with
energy efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted across multiple
benchmarks, including model size, inference speed, throughput, and power
consumption. The optimized models maintained their performance, achieving an
F1-Score of 87.18% with a precision of 93.18% and recall of 81.91%.
Post-compression results showed reductions in model size of up to 0.41, along
with improvements in inference speed and throughput, and a decrease in energy
consumption of up to 0.93 in INT8 precision. These findings validate the
feasibility of deploying high-performing, energy-efficient diagnostic tools on
resource-constrained edge devices. Beyond skin cancer detection, the
methodologies applied in this research have broader applications in other
medical diagnostics and domains requiring accessible, efficient AI solutions.
This study underscores the potential of optimized AI systems to revolutionize
healthcare diagnostics, thereby bridging the divide between advanced technology
and underserved regions.

Result: 在TikTok Pay等任务中，ARIA的适应性和准确性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ARIA在实际部署中验证了其在快速变化环境中的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules
and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance
and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and
standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to
new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose
the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework
designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test
time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue,
proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or
corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal,
timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and
resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and
clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence
name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic
knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability
and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and
existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over
150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness
for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

Method: 提出稳定性引导的自适应扩散加速（SADA），结合ODE求解器信息，动态分配稀疏性。

Result: 在多个模型上实现≥1.8倍加速，保真度损失极小（LPIPS≤0.10，FID≤4.5）。

Conclusion: SADA高效且通用，适用于多种模型和模态，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

Conclusion: PICore显著降低了神经算子的训练成本和效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings
between function spaces. However, there are two main bottlenecks in training
neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We
provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/PICore.

Abstract: Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the
predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box"
nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders
the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and
prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI)
methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the
causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide
explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable
countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based
counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations
for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against
several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3
modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also
presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation
algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our
proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the
tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by
reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how
counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing
them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at
instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global
counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack
queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense
mechanisms.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate
change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been
made by the \textbf{end-to-end methods}, thanks to deep learning techniques,
but they face limitations of \textit{representation inconsistency} in
multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency
between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating
different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \textbf{two-stage
training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue,
but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the
results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an
implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders
for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen
while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second
stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures
inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a
self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the
performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments
show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces
the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by
28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively. The source code is available at

Abstract: Effective content moderation is essential for video platforms to safeguard
user experience and uphold community standards. While traditional video
classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they
struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and
contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a
promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal
reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder
their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes
full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for
discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,
we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a
multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable
industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that
integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over
traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online
evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume
by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5%
of direct full-scale deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法在多种压缩率和效用目标下均表现出更优的权衡，为数据集蒸馏提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

Result: 在7种设备上验证了P3SL的有效性，平衡了能耗、隐私泄露和模型准确性。

Conclusion: P3SL为异构边缘设备提供了高效、隐私保护的个性化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning
technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in
model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side
sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it
encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices
vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental
conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored
heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying
resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and
local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split
Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device
systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a
personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to
achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models
tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and
privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers
clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without
sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,
environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach
balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high
model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7
devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop,
using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental
conditions.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of
energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the
need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the
key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size
of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data
continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple
locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated
Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw
data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to
the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),
computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a
data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on
reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.
Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated
datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,
and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We
develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric
factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon
emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive
recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,
minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to
time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the
environmental impact of FL tasks.

Result: DistrAttention比FlashAttention-2快37%，在ViT推理中速度最快且精度最高，在Llama3-1B中仅损失1%精度。

Conclusion: DistrAttention在保持高效的同时，显著提升了自注意力机制的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the
state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing,
computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component,
self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence
length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches
on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack
of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and
flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention
achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually
referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and
fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A
block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors
introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block
sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining
high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive
experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than
FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,
DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate
self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the
lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.

Conclusion: 编码空间的紧凑性和分散性对生成模型至关重要，为VAE和VQ-VAE的设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper explores the generative capabilities of Autoencoders (AEs) and
establishes connections between Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Vector
Quantized-Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) through a reformulated training
framework. We demonstrate that AEs exhibit generative potential via latent
space interpolation and perturbation, albeit limited by undefined regions in
the encoding space. To address this, we propose a new VAE-like training method
that introduces clustering centers to enhance data compactness and ensure
well-defined latent spaces without relying on traditional KL divergence or
reparameterization techniques. Experimental results on MNIST, CelebA, and
FashionMNIST datasets show smooth interpolative transitions, though blurriness
persists. Extending this approach to multiple learnable vectors, we observe a
natural progression toward a VQ-VAE-like model in continuous space. However,
when the encoder outputs multiple vectors, the model degenerates into a
discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which combines image fragments without learning
semantic representations. Our findings highlight the critical role of encoding
space compactness and dispersion in generative modeling and provide insights
into the intrinsic connections between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, offering a new
perspective on their design and limitations.

interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries
for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.
This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational
issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck
identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities,
outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves
near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex

applications, aimed at building a global model across a network of
heterogeneous users without requiring the sharing of private data. We focus on
model learning over decentralized architectures, where users collaborate
directly to update the global model without relying on a central server. In
this context, the current paper proposes a novel approach to collaboratively
learn probabilistic generative classifiers with a parametric form. The
framework is composed by a communication network over a set of local nodes,
each of one having its own local data, and a local updating rule. The proposal
involves sharing local statistics with neighboring nodes, where each node
aggregates the neighbors' information and iteratively learns its own local
classifier, which progressively converges to a global model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally
competitive model across a wide range of network topologies, network sizes,
local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

*Zhuokun Chen,Zeren Chen,Jiahao He,Mingkui Tan,Jianfei Cai,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Stitch是一种基于置信度的混合解码框架，通过在小语言模型（SLM）和大语言模型（LLM）之间切换，加速链式思维（CoT）推理，减少推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT推理方法存在计算开销大或加速效果有限的问题，R-Stitch旨在通过选择性调用LLM来提高效率。

Method: R-Stitch默认使用SLM生成令牌，仅在SLM置信度低于阈值时调用LLM，避免全序列回滚。

Result: 实验表明，R-Stitch在数学推理基准测试中减少了85%的推理延迟，且准确率下降可忽略。

Conclusion: R-Stitch是一种高效、无需训练的加速方法，适用于标准解码流程，显著提升了CoT推理的实用性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于工具变量的混淆因果模仿学习模型（C2L），通过两阶段框架解决未测量混淆变量对策略估计的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习常受未测量混淆变量的影响，导致策略估计偏差，需通过工具变量（IV）解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过伪变量构建测试标准识别有效IV；第二阶段基于IV提出两种策略学习方法（模拟器和离线）。

Result: 实验验证了有效IV识别和策略学习的有效性。

Conclusion: C2L模型能有效解决多时间步混淆问题，提升模仿学习的准确性。

Abstract: Imitation learning from demonstrations usually suffers from the confounding
effects of unmeasured variables (i.e., unmeasured confounders) on the states
and actions. If ignoring them, a biased estimation of the policy would be
entailed. To break up this confounding gap, in this paper, we take the best of
the strong power of instrumental variables (IV) and propose a Confounded Causal
Imitation Learning (C2L) model. This model accommodates confounders that
influence actions across multiple timesteps, rather than being restricted to
immediate temporal dependencies. We develop a two-stage imitation learning
framework for valid IV identification and policy optimization. In particular,
in the first stage, we construct a testing criterion based on the defined
pseudo-variable, with which we achieve identifying a valid IV for the C2L
models. Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability
conditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we
propose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator,
while the other is offline. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of
identifying the valid IV as well as learning the policy.

*Shahil Shaik,Jonathon M. Smereka,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优传输理论的分布式GAE（DGAE），用于解决传统GAE无法处理分布强化学习中的价值分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAE无法处理分布强化学习中的价值分布，而分布强化学习能更好地捕捉系统随机性，对噪声更鲁棒。

Method: 利用最优传输理论引入Wasserstein-like方向度量，结合指数加权估计，提出DGAE。

Result: DGAE在多种OpenAI Gym环境中表现优于传统GAE，提供低方差优势估计。

Conclusion: DGAE是一种有效的分布强化学习优势估计方法，适用于依赖优势估计的策略梯度算法。

Abstract: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) has been used to mitigate the
computational complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) by employing an
exponentially weighted estimation of the advantage function to reduce the
variance in policy gradient estimates. Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not
designed to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can
capture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to
system noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes
the optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional
metric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies
between probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation,
we leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional
GAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a
low-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for
policy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy
updates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods.
Algorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared
with the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance.

Abstract: Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and
complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated
analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific
discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an
interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research
workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike
static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction,
continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We
validated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate
change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex
phenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically
sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as
comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow.
Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language
interface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to
strategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step
towards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth system
research in an era of accelerating global change.

Motivation: 传统数值方法（如有限元法）在处理大规模复杂几何问题时计算成本高，现有神经网络方法难以应用于复杂几何的PDE问题。

Method: 使用预训练的神经算子（PPNO）作为域分解方案中的替代模型，结合理论证明神经算子在域分解中的近似存在性。

Result: 在复杂几何的椭圆PDE问题上表现出色，具有分辨率不变性和对未见过微结构模式的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: L-DDM方法有效解决了复杂几何PDE问题，为大规模结构建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have
driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at
much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical
methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle
with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and
geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods
have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate
nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely
limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs
involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain
decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a
single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a
surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle
large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical
result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of
domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method
by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous
microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural
operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers
resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns
unseen during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整压缩比和延迟的DeCo-SGD方法，解决了高延迟和低带宽网络中分布式SGD的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高延迟和低带宽网络中，分布式SGD的性能严重下降，现有方法缺乏理论指导，无法动态调整参数。

Method: 通过分解联合优化问题，提出理论工具，并结合网络感知时间最小化条件，设计动态调整压缩比和延迟的DeCo-SGD。

Result: DeCo-SGD在高延迟和低带宽网络中比D-SGD和静态策略分别提升了5.07倍和1.37倍的速度。

Conclusion: DeCo-SGD通过动态调整参数，显著提升了分布式SGD在挑战性网络环境中的性能。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning in high end-to-end latency and low, varying
bandwidth network environments undergoes severe throughput degradation. Due to
its low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the
mainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from
significant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing
approaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to
alleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both
challenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a
complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed
synchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance
under varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to
dynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on
static heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which
prevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical
gap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization
problem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable
noise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies
the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a
critical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect
training. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware
time minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the
compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and
training task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and
static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,
respectively.

Motivation: 序数分类问题在现实应用中广泛存在，但缺乏全面的数据集用于基准测试，因此需要建立一个公开的数据仓库。

Method: 通过预处理46个表格数据集，确保数据量和类别分布合理，并提供30个随机分区索引以支持实验复现。

Result: 建立了TOC-UCO仓库，为序数分类研究提供了标准化的基准测试平台。

Conclusion: TOC-UCO填补了序数分类领域的数据集空白，有助于推动新方法的开发和验证。

Abstract: An ordinal classification (OC) problem corresponds to a special type of
classification characterised by the presence of a natural order relationship
among the classes. This type of problem can be found in a number of real-world
applications, motivating the design and development of many ordinal
methodologies over the last years. However, it is important to highlight that
the development of the OC field suffers from one main disadvantage: the lack of
a comprehensive set of datasets on which novel approaches to the literature
have to be benchmarked. In order to approach this objective, this manuscript
from the University of C\'ordoba (UCO), which have previous experience on the
OC field, provides the literature with a publicly available repository of
tabular data for a robust validation of novel OC approaches, namely TOC-UCO
(Tabular Ordinal Classification repository of the UCO). Specifically, this
repository includes a set of $46$ tabular ordinal datasets, preprocessed under
a common framework and ensured to have a reasonable number of patterns and an
appropriate class distribution. We also provide the sources and preprocessing
steps of each dataset, along with details on how to benchmark a novel approach
using the TOC-UCO repository. For this, indices for $30$ different randomised
train-test partitions are provided to facilitate the reproducibility of the
experiments.

Result: 在六个多跳问答数据集上达到最先进的答案准确性，使用小规模模型和有限计算资源即可匹配前沿LLMs。

Conclusion: DynaSearcher具有广泛适用性，展示了强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks.
However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical
applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate
queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning
deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose
DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs
and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system
leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search
process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual
consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for
fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy,
efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of
high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while
discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or
redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets,
matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited
computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and
larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

Motivation: 现实AI系统需在长尾数据分布下持续学习新类别并保留旧知识，现有方法难以平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Method: 结合变分自编码器建模类别分布，利用Wasserstein距离重构尾部类别分布。

Result: 在六个长尾分类基准测试中，ViRN平均准确率提升10.24%。

Conclusion: ViRN通过变分推断和几何融合有效解决了长尾数据下的持续学习挑战。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with long-tailed data distributions remains a
critical challenge for real-world AI systems, where models must sequentially
adapt to new classes while retaining knowledge of old ones, despite severe
class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to balance stability and plasticity,
often collapsing under extreme sample scarcity. To address this, we propose
ViRN, a novel CL framework that integrates variational inference (VI) with
distributional trilateration for robust long-tailed learning. First, we model
class-conditional distributions via a Variational Autoencoder to mitigate bias
toward head classes. Second, we reconstruct tail-class distributions via
Wasserstein distance-based neighborhood retrieval and geometric fusion,
enabling sample-efficient alignment of tail-class representations. Evaluated on
six long-tailed classification benchmarks, including speech (e.g., rare
acoustic events, accents) and image tasks, ViRN achieves a 10.24% average
accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VB-CGCD通过变分推理和协方差对齐有效缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge:
incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving
knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We
address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens,
revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives
performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes
C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with
covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns
class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic
variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21%
with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also
introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended
online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher
than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across
diverse scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/daihao42/VB-CGCD

Motivation: 量化方法的研究快速发展，但不同方法的实验条件和理论基础缺乏统一性，因此需要公平比较和理论分析以深入理解量化技术。

Method: 将量化方法解耦为预量化变换和量化误差缓解两部分，并在相同条件下进行实验评估，同时分析MXFP4数据格式的性能。

Result: 优化的旋转和缩放对预量化变换效果最佳；低秩补偿与GPTQ结合有时优于单独使用GPTQ；MXFP4的最优策略与INT4不同。

Conclusion: 量化方法的研究需要更公平的比较和理论分析，MXFP4的量化策略需进一步探索。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can
significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model
quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have
reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same
ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In
addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is
crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an
extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive
evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge,
this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet
underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple
the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization
transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a
preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of
outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for
quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the
errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We
evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization
methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and
its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation
and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and
combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ
alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential
of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization
transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring
further investigation.

Motivation: 现有分支定界（BaB）方法在验证神经网络时效率低下，因为它以“先到先服务”的方式探索子问题空间。

Method: Oliva框架引入了一种子问题排序机制，包括贪婪策略（Oliva^GR）和模拟退火策略（Oliva^SA），以优化子问题的探索顺序。

Result: 实验表明，Oliva在MNIST和CIFAR10数据集上分别实现了最高25倍和80倍的加速。

Conclusion: Oliva通过智能子问题排序显著提升了神经网络验证的效率，且不会因无反例而降低性能。

Abstract: The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has
necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the
quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is
a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to
sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the
sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these
sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from
an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this
gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,
concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.
Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that
explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more
likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of
the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it
only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead
to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including
$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that
are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy
inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to
exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally
evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5
models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up
to 80X in CIFAR10.

Motivation: 现有方法在多元时间序列预测中无法同时捕捉变量间依赖关系和变量特定时间模式，C3RL旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在七种模型上的实验表明，C3RL将基于CI和CM策略的模型性能分别提升至81.4%和76.3%。

Conclusion: C3RL展示了强大的泛化能力和有效性，为多元时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to
its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either
channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can
capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific
temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit
cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion
offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we
propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models
both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer
vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and
builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone,
while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and
prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and
forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL
boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy
and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong
generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is
accepted.

Result: 在真实招生数据上显著优于现有方法，提升可解释性和预测性能。

Conclusion: BGM-HAN为需要结构、上下文和公平性的决策领域提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Human decision-making in high-stakes domains often relies on expertise and
heuristics, but is vulnerable to hard-to-detect cognitive biases that threaten
fairness and long-term outcomes. This work presents a novel approach to
enhancing complex decision-making workflows through the integration of
hierarchical learning alongside various enhancements. Focusing on university
admissions as a representative high-stakes domain, we propose BGM-HAN, an
enhanced Byte-Pair Encoded, Gated Multi-head Hierarchical Attention Network,
designed to effectively model semi-structured applicant data. BGM-HAN captures
multi-level representations that are crucial for nuanced assessment, improving
both interpretability and predictive performance. Experimental results on real
admissions data demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms
both state-of-the-art baselines from traditional machine learning to large
language models, offering a promising framework for augmenting decision-making
in domains where structure, context, and fairness matter. Source code is

### [148] [DNT: a Deeply Normalized Transformer that can be trained by Momentum SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17501)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度归一化Transformer（DNT），通过精心设计的归一化技术，使其能够使用普通的动量SGDW（mSGDW）训练，性能与AdamW训练的Transformer相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer训练依赖AdamW优化器，而mSGDW因梯度分布重尾难以有效训练。DNT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在Transformer中策略性地集成归一化技术，调节各层Jacobian矩阵，平衡权重、激活及其相互作用的影响，使梯度分布更集中。

Result: DNT在ViT和GPT架构上表现优于传统Transformer，且能有效使用mSGDW训练。

Conclusion: DNT通过深度归一化技术成功克服了mSGDW训练的局限性，为Transformer训练提供了更高效的选择。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.

Motivation: 传统生成模型假设简单几何结构并依赖强密度估计假设，导致轨迹不满足流形上的最优性原则。

Method: 提出HOTA方法，利用Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman框架和Kantorovich势能进行轨迹优化。

Result: HOTA在标准基准和自定义数据集上均优于基线，特别是在非光滑成本函数下。

Conclusion: HOTA提供了一种高效且可扩展的轨迹优化方法，无需显式密度建模，适用于复杂几何结构。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the
probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial
geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions,
yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in
the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection
(HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical
OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and
scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for
explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are
non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks,
as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of
feasibility and optimality.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该方法在累积遗憾边界上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效整合图信息，提升决策性能。

Abstract: The matrix contextual bandit (CB), as an extension of the well-known
multi-armed bandit, is a powerful framework that has been widely applied in
sequential decision-making scenarios involving low-rank structure. In many
real-world scenarios, such as online advertising and recommender systems,
additional graph information often exists beyond the low-rank structure, that
is, the similar relationships among users/items can be naturally captured
through the connectivity among nodes in the corresponding graphs. However,
existing matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby
making them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill
in this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework
that builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new
framework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph
information in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a
joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the
implementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB
algorithm. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that our procedure
outperforms several popular alternatives in terms of cumulative regret bound,
owing to the effective utilization of graph information. A series of synthetic
and real-world data experiments are conducted to further illustrate the merits
of our procedure.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，为联邦学习中的随机优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified approach for designing stochastic optimization
algorithms that robustly scale to the federated learning setting. Our work
studies a class of Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, which possesses a
linearly parameterized family of majorizing surrogate functions. This framework
encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth
objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as
variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying
algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM),
which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then
extend \SSMM\ to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common
bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and
communication constraints; this yields \QSMM. The originality of \QSMM\ is to
learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the
\textit{surrogate majorizing function}, contrary to classical algorithms which
learn and aggregate the \textit{original parameter}. Finally, to showcase the
flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to
design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated
setting.

Motivation: 联邦学习在多领域应用中面临高通信成本、数据异构性和隐私威胁等挑战，结合量子计算和Fisher信息有望提升模型性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用Fisher信息量化量子状态参数变化的信息量，设计QFL算法，通过识别关键参数并在聚合过程中保留这些参数。

Result: 在ADNI和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，QFL在性能和鲁棒性上优于量子联邦平均方法。

Conclusion: QFL算法通过Fisher信息有效解决了联邦学习的挑战，为量子联邦学习的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different
sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model
without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication
between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several
challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged
processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent
years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits
has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for
fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of
quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance
model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that
Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state
carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric
and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the
aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on
local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.
This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence
the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the
aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of
QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the
benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental
results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum
federated averaging method.

However, they are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. In this
paper, we introduce XStacking, an effective and inherently explainable
framework that addresses this limitation by integrating dynamic feature
transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations. This enables
stacked models to retain their predictive accuracy while becoming inherently
explainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on 29 datasets,
achieving improvements in both the predictive effectiveness of the learning
space and the interpretability of the resulting models. XStacking offers a
practical and scalable solution for responsible ML.

Conclusion: 提出了几条指南，以帮助未来设计的元学习算法在强化学习中达到最佳性能。

Abstract: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on
manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the
performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise
for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from
supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.
However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different
meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box
functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical
comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned
algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to
meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the
interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.
Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL
algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as
performant as possible.

Conclusion: D2 α-GANs和广义双判别器GAN在理论和实验上均表现出色，扩展了GAN的灵活性。

Abstract: Dual discriminator generative adversarial networks (D2 GANs) were introduced
to mitigate the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks. In
D2 GANs, two discriminators are employed alongside a generator: one
discriminator rewards high scores for samples from the true data distribution,
while the other favors samples from the generator. In this work, we first
introduce dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs), which combines
the strengths of dual discriminators with the flexibility of a tunable loss
function, $\alpha$-loss. We further generalize this approach to arbitrary
functions defined on positive reals, leading to a broader class of models we
refer to as generalized dual discriminator generative adversarial networks. For
each of these proposed models, we provide theoretical analysis and show that
the associated min-max optimization reduces to the minimization of a linear
combination of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence. This generalizes
the known simplification for D2-GANs, where the objective reduces to a linear
combination of the KL-divergence and the reverse KL-divergence. Finally, we
perform experiments on 2D synthetic data and use multiple performance metrics
to capture various advantages of our GANs.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，OGCIL优于现有GCIL和开放集GNN方法。

Conclusion: OGCIL框架有效解决了开放集图类增量学习的挑战，实现了知识保留和未知类检测的平衡。

Abstract: Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs)
to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class
knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods
primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed
to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge
during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a
more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two
intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs
the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which
destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,
a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding
generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust
detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional
variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old
classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle
unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node
embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further
proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class
prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all
unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly
models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a
robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN
methods.

Result: 实验证明JAL在标签噪声问题中表现优异。

Conclusion: JAL通过结合非对称损失和APL框架，显著提升了标签噪声下的模型性能。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

Motivation: 解决多任务适配器存储需求高的问题，尤其是在资源受限的环境中。

Method: 利用低秩适配器矩阵的相似性，设计灵活的合并技术。

Result: 存储大小减少48%，性能仅下降0.2-1.8%，优于现有合并技术。

Conclusion: HydraOpt在存储效率和性能之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based
adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a
separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements,
posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile
devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they
typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we
introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the
inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike
existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and
performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and
performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage
size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving
competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing
merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse
storage efficiency.

Result: 压缩性会引入敏感方向，影响模型的L∞和L2鲁棒性，且这种脆弱性在不同压缩方式下普遍存在。

Conclusion: 压缩性与鲁棒性之间存在根本性矛盾，为设计高效且安全的模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

Abstract: Over the past decade, advances in generative modeling, such as generative
adversarial networks, masked autoencoders, and diffusion models, have
significantly transformed biological research and discovery, enabling
breakthroughs in molecule design, protein generation, drug discovery, and
beyond. At the same time, biological applications have served as valuable
testbeds for evaluating the capabilities of generative models. Recently, flow
matching has emerged as a powerful and efficient alternative to diffusion-based
generative modeling, with growing interest in its application to problems in
biology and life sciences. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of recent developments in flow matching and its applications in biological
domains. We begin by systematically reviewing the foundations and variants of
flow matching, and then categorize its applications into three major areas:
biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and
protein generation. For each, we provide an in-depth review of recent progress.
We also summarize commonly used datasets and software tools, and conclude with

Result: 在HealthBench-1k上相对Likert方法提升28%，且与专家参考信号性能相当。

Conclusion: RaR通过结构化奖励信号，使小规模模型更符合人类偏好且性能稳健。

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world
tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria.
However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it
difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models.
While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on
opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious
correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework
that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals
for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$
relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based
approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals
derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured
reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better
align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model
scales.

Result: 高学习率在多种数据集、模型和优化器中均表现出色，且优于其他超参数和正则化方法。

Conclusion: 高学习率不仅能提升标准分类任务的性能，还能有效解决训练数据中的隐藏/罕见虚假相关性。

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Motivation: 通过量化规范性驾驶行为，帮助开发车辆安全和智能交通系统。

Method: 利用SHRP 2 NDS数据（3400多名驾驶员，3400万英里驾驶里程），结合车辆、GPS和雷达数据生成驾驶指标摘要，并开发交互式在线分析工具。

Result: 研究发现，16-19岁女性驾驶员在65英里/小时道路上超速行为略多于同龄男性，年轻驾驶员保持较短车距的频率高于年长驾驶员。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to process large-scale naturalistic driving
studies (NDS) to describe the driving behavior for five vehicle metrics,
including speed, speeding, lane keeping, following distance, and headway,
contextualized by roadway characteristics, vehicle classes, and driver
demographics. Such descriptions of normative driving behaviors can aid in the
development of vehicle safety and intelligent transportation systems. The
methodology is demonstrated using data from the Second Strategic Highway
Research Program (SHRP 2) NDS, which includes over 34 million miles of driving
across more than 3,400 drivers. Summaries of each driving metric were generated
using vehicle, GPS, and forward radar data. Additionally, interactive online
analytics tools were developed to visualize and compare driving behavior across
groups through dynamic data selection and grouping. For example, among drivers
on 65-mph roads for the SHRP 2 NDS, females aged 16-19 exceeded the speed limit
by 7.5 to 15 mph slightly more often than their male counterparts, and younger
drivers maintained headways under 1.5 seconds more frequently than older
drivers. This work supports better vehicle systems and safer infrastructure by
quantifying normative driving behaviors and offers a methodology for analyzing
NDS datasets for cross group comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水产养殖网箱检查方法缺乏动态适应性和用户交互性，AquaChat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AquaChat采用三层架构：高层规划层（LLM解析自然语言命令）、中层任务管理器（生成控制序列）、低层运动控制层（执行任务）。

Result: 实验验证了AquaChat在模拟和真实环境中的高效性和准确性。

Conclusion: AquaChat展示了语言AI与海洋机器人结合的潜力，为可持续水产养殖提供智能检查方案。

Abstract: Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for maintaining the
structural integrity, biosecurity, and operational efficiency of fish farming
systems. Traditional inspection approaches rely on pre-programmed missions or
manual control, offering limited adaptability to dynamic underwater conditions
and user-specific demands. In this study, we propose AquaChat, a novel Remotely
Operated Vehicle (ROV) framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs)
for intelligent and adaptive net pen inspection. The system features a
multi-layered architecture: (1) a high-level planning layer that interprets
natural language user commands using an LLM to generate symbolic task plans;
(2) a mid-level task manager that translates plans into ROV control sequences;
and (3) a low-level motion control layer that executes navigation and
inspection tasks with precision. Real-time feedback and event-triggered
replanning enhance robustness in challenging aquaculture environments. The
framework is validated through experiments in both simulated and controlled
aquatic environments representative of aquaculture net pens. Results
demonstrate improved task flexibility, inspection accuracy, and operational
efficiency. AquaChat illustrates the potential of integrating language-based AI
with marine robotics to enable intelligent, user-interactive inspection systems
for sustainable aquaculture operations.

Motivation: 软机械臂的高自由度和柔顺性使其适用于安全交互和灵活任务，但运动控制面临外部负载和驱动器饱和的挑战。

Method: 采用双学习策略：基于强化学习的多目标传感器空间控制框架用于开放空间，生成对抗模仿学习用于受限空间。

Conclusion: SS-ILKC框架解决了软机械臂在受限环境中的运动控制问题，并通过仿真到现实的迁移机制实现了零样本部署。

Abstract: The intrinsic compliance and high degree of freedom (DoF) of redundant soft
manipulators facilitate safe interaction and flexible task execution. However,
effective kinematic control remains highly challenging, as it must handle
deformations caused by unknown external loads and avoid actuator saturation due
to improper null-space regulation - particularly in confined environments. In
this paper, we propose a Sensor-Space Imitation Learning Kinematic Control
(SS-ILKC) framework to enable robust kinematic control under actuator
saturation and restrictive environmental constraints. We employ a dual-learning
strategy: a multi-goal sensor-space control framework based on reinforcement
learning principle is trained in simulation to develop robust control policies
for open spaces, while a generative adversarial imitation learning approach
enables effective policy learning from sparse expert demonstrations for
confined spaces. To enable zero-shot real-world deployment, a pre-processed
sim-to-real transfer mechanism is proposed to mitigate the
simulation-to-reality gap and accurately characterize actuator saturation
limits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively
control a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator, achieving precise
path-following and object manipulation in confined environments under unknown
loading conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了自动驾驶车辆合并的效率和安全性，为交通控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue
propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally,
queuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand
and fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during
congestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a
factor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an
analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging
of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the
first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the
multi-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed
form formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue
length and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a
crash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential
collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.
Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly
minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision
variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is
formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to
find the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset
validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the
proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more
efficient and safer merging process.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled the
development of mobile agents that can understand visual inputs and follow user
instructions, unlocking new possibilities for automating complex tasks on
mobile devices. However, applying these models to real-world mobile scenarios
remains a significant challenge due to the long-horizon task execution,
difficulty in error recovery, and the cold-start problem in unfamiliar
environments. To address these challenges, we propose MobileUse, a GUI agent
designed for robust and adaptive mobile task execution. To improve resilience
in long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments, we introduce a hierarchical
reflection architecture that enables the agent to self-monitor, detect, and
recover from errors across multiple temporal scales-ranging from individual
actions to overall task completion-while maintaining efficiency through a
reflection-on-demand strategy. To tackle cold-start issues, we further
introduce a proactive exploration module, which enriches the agent's
understanding of the environment through self-planned exploration. Evaluations
on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks demonstrate that MobileUse
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving success rates of 62.9%
and 44.2%, respectively. To facilitate real-world applications, we release an
out-of-the-box toolkit for automated task execution on physical mobile devices,
which is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.

Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such
as aviation, mining, and long-haul transport. However, most existing methods
rely on high-end sensors and controlled environments, limiting their
applicability in real world settings. This paper formally defines a practical
yet underexplored problem setting for real world fatigue detection, where
systems operating with context-appropriate sensors aim to leverage knowledge
from differently instrumented sources including those using impractical sensors
deployed in controlled environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
heterogeneous and multi-source fatigue detection framework that adaptively
utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while benefiting from
the diverse configurations present in source domains. Our experiments,
conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and two publicly
available datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved
generalization of our approach, paving the practical way for effective fatigue
monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has become a key technology for achieving
low-cost and precise positioning. However, traditional CNN-based inertial
positioning methods struggle to capture the nonlinear motion characteristics
and long-term dependencies in IMU data. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel inertial positioning network with a generic backbone called
ResChebyKAN, which leverages the nonlinear approximation capabilities of
Chebyshev polynomials to model complex motion patterns. Additionally, we
introduce an Efficient Kernel-based Self-Attention (EKSA) module to effectively
capture contextual information and enhance long-term dependency modeling.
Experimental results on public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, RNIN-VIO, OxIOD,
IMUNet, and TLIO) demonstrate that our method reduces the absolute trajectory
error by 3.79% to 42.32% compared to existing benchmark methods. Furthermore,
we release a preprocessed dataset and empirically show that removing the
gravity component from acceleration data significantly improves inertial
positioning performance.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of modern on-chip antennas remains challenging, as
current probe-station techniques offer limited angular coverage, rely on
bespoke hardware, and require frequent manual alignment. This research
introduces RAPTAR (Radiation Pattern Acquisition through Robotic Automation), a
portable, state-of-the-art, and autonomous system based on collaborative

collision-free manipulation across a hemispherical spatial domain, guided by
real-time motion planning and calibration accuracy with RMS error below 0.9 mm.
The system achieves an angular resolution upto 2.5 degree and integrates

Abstract: Smart electric wheelchairs can improve user experience by supporting the
driver with shared control. State-of-the-art work showed the potential of
shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots.
However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive
behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional
driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which
takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and
reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and
tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and
reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort.
We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly
orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared
to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real
transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world
implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility
platform.

Abstract: Manipulating clusters of deformable objects presents a substantial challenge
with widespread applicability, but requires contact-rich whole-arm
interactions. A potential solution must address the limited capacity for
realistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of
efficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for
learning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and
proprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body
contact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our
reinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state
representation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training
efficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel
context-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region
for exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario
and observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple
arm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy
transfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion
patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel spherical target-based LiDAR-camera extrinsic
calibration method designed for outdoor environments with multi-robot systems,
considering both target and sensor corruption. The method extracts the 2D
ellipse center from the image and the 3D sphere center from the pointcloud,
which are then paired to compute the transformation matrix. Specifically, the
image is first decomposed using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Then, a novel
algorithm extracts an ellipse from a potentially corrupted sphere, and the
extracted center of ellipse is corrected for errors caused by the perspective
projection model. For the LiDAR pointcloud, points on the sphere tend to be
highly noisy due to the absence of flat regions. To accurately extract the
sphere from these noisy measurements, we apply a hierarchical weighted sum to
the accumulated pointcloud. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the
sphere can be robustly detected even under both types of corruption,
outperforming other targets. We evaluated our method using three different
types of LiDARs (spinning, solid-state, and non-repetitive) with cameras
positioned in three different locations. Furthermore, we validated the
robustness of our method to target corruption by experimenting with spheres
subjected to various types of degradation. These experiments were conducted in
both a planetary test and a field environment. Our code is available at

Abstract: With the rapid development of the construction industry, issues such as harsh
working environments, high-intensity and high-risk tasks, and labor shortages
have become increasingly prominent. This drives higher demands for construction
robots in terms of low energy consumption, high mobility, and high load
capacity. This paper focuses on the design and optimization of leg structures
for construction robots, aiming to improve their dynamic performance, reduce
energy consumption, and enhance load-bearing capabilities. Firstly, based on
the leg configuration of ants in nature, we design a structure for the robot's
leg. Secondly, we propose a novel structural optimization method. Using the
Lagrangian approach, a dynamic model of the leg was established. Combining the
dynamic model with the leg's motion trajectory, we formulated multiple dynamic
evaluation metrics and conducted a comprehensive optimization study on the
geometric parameters of each leg segment. The results show that the optimized
leg structure reduces peak joint torques and energy consumption by over 20%.
Finally, dynamic simulation experiments were conducted using ADAMS. The results
demonstrate a significant reduction in the driving power of each joint after
optimization, validating the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed
strategy. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support
for the design of heavy-load, high-performance construction robots.

Abstract: In the construction industry, traditional methods fail to meet the modern
demands for efficiency and quality. The curtain wall installation is a critical
component of construction projects. We design a hydraulically driven robotic
arm for curtain wall installation and a dynamic parameter identification
method. We establish a Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) model based on measured robotic
arm structural parameters and integrate hydraulic cylinder dynamics to
construct a composite parametric system driven by a Stribeck friction model. By
designing high-signal-to-noise ratio displacement excitation signals for
hydraulic cylinders and combining Fourier series to construct optimal
excitation trajectories that satisfy joint constraints, this method effectively
excites the characteristics of each parameter in the minimal parameter set of
the dynamic model of the robotic arm. On this basis, a hierarchical progressive
parameter identification strategy is proposed: least squares estimation is
employed to separately identify and jointly calibrate the dynamic parameters of
both the hydraulic cylinder and the robotic arm, yielding Stribeck model curves
for each joint. Experimental validation on a robotic arm platform demonstrates
residual standard deviations below 0.4 Nm between theoretical and measured
joint torques, confirming high-precision dynamic parameter identification for
the hydraulic-driven curtain wall installation robotic arm. This significantly
contributes to enhancing the intelligence level of curtain wall installation
operations.

Abstract: In the context of labor shortages and rising costs, construction robots are
regarded as the key to revolutionizing traditional construction methods and
improving efficiency and quality in the construction industry. In order to
ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in
complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory
optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the
changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective
trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall
installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation,
integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its
physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper
proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO)
that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the
convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively
balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed
algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive
trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better
convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets
of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the
efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving
multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation
tasks.

human-level physical capabilities; (2) developing an intuitive and scalable
whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection; and (3) creating
algorithms capable of learning whole-body visuomotor policies from human
demonstrations. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we propose
Astribot Suite, a robot learning suite for whole-body manipulation aimed at
general daily tasks across diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our system on a wide range of activities that require
whole-body coordination, extensive reachability, human-level dexterity, and
agility. Our results show that Astribot's cohesive integration of embodiment,
teleoperation interface, and learning pipeline marks a significant step towards
real-world, general-purpose whole-body robotic manipulation, laying the
groundwork for the next generation of intelligent robots.

TL;DR: 提出了一种类似猎鹰训练的交互系统，使扑翼无人机能够在人手上安全着陆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扑翼无人机与人类之间的实际交互，尤其是在拥挤或空间受限的环境中。

Method: 设计了一种考虑人类安全和心理因素的轨迹规划方法，并使用商业扑翼平台进行实验。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够实现安全且平滑的手部着陆交互。

Conclusion: 这是首次实现扑翼无人机与人类之间的接触式交互。

Abstract: Flapping-wing drones have attracted significant attention due to their
biomimetic flight. They are considered more human-friendly due to their
characteristics such as low noise and flexible wings, making them suitable for
human-drone interactions. However, few studies have explored the practical
interaction between humans and flapping-wing drones. On establishing a physical
interaction system with flapping-wing drones, we can acquire inspirations from
falconers who guide birds of prey to land on their arms. This interaction
interprets the human body as a dynamic landing platform, which can be utilized
in various scenarios such as crowded or spatially constrained environments.
Thus, in this study, we propose a falconry-like interaction system in which a
flapping-wing drone performs a palm landing motion on a human hand. To achieve
a safe approach toward humans, we design a trajectory planning method that
considers both physical and psychological factors of the human safety such as
the drone's velocity and distance from the user. We use a commercial flapping
platform with our implemented motion planning and conduct experiments to
evaluate the palm landing performance and safety. The results demonstrate that
our approach enables safe and smooth hand landing interactions. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first time to achieve a contact-based interaction
between flapping-wing drones and humans.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为JAM的两阶段多智能体交互预测框架，用于解决多智能体联合预测中低概率模式生成质量低的问题。


<details>

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上表现优异，优于其他预测框架。

Conclusion: JAM框架在多智能体交互预测中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of road participants is a critical task in
autonomous driving. In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality
generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle
this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework
named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware
marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction
process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to
learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information
for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint
prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals
from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We
explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in
better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial
predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world
Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show
that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the
framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction
frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory
prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/LinFunster/JAM to
facilitate future research.

*Botao Lin,Shuang Song,Jiaole Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种可重构肌腱驱动机器人（RTR），通过可锁关节消除段间耦合，简化控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统肌腱驱动机器人（TDR）段间耦合复杂，控制难度大。

Method: 设计可锁关节，通过拮抗肌腱控制关节状态，无需持续供电。

Result: RTR消除了段间耦合，验证了运动学和静力学模型，仅需6个电机驱动7关节。

Conclusion: RTR在复杂环境中表现出优越的可重构性和移动能力。

Abstract: With a slender redundant body, the tendon-driven robot (TDR) has a large
workspace and great maneuverability while working in complex environments. TDR
comprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of
driving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances
dexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces
intensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control
requires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a
reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable
joints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through
a pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a
continuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively
actuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates
the inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex
coordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated
and compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further
revealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and
validation experiments have been conducted. Demonstrations have been performed
using a seven-joint RTR prototype to show its reconfigurability and moving
ability in complex environments with an actuator pack comprising only six
motors.

Motivation: 在不确定任务需求的环境中，机器人使用通用工具时缺乏预定义策略，导致工具寿命高度依赖使用方式。如何学习既能完成任务又能延长工具寿命的策略是一个关键挑战。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合有限元分析和Miner法则估计剩余使用寿命，并通过自适应奖励归一化机制动态调整奖励。

Result: 在模拟和真实任务中验证，学习到的策略显著延长工具寿命（模拟中最高达8.01倍），并能有效迁移到实际场景。

Conclusion: 该框架为学习寿命导向的工具使用策略提供了实用价值，适用于复杂环境中的机器人操作。

Abstract: In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely
on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are
not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive
to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot
learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's
lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a
factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based
on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide
policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL
can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward
Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on
estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across
simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and
Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies
consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer
effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of
learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.

Result: 实验证明，触觉反馈提高了任务规划效率和执行精度。

Conclusion: VLA-Touch为触觉反馈在机器人任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tactile feedback is generally recognized to be crucial for effective
interaction with the physical world. However, state-of-the-art
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use
tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks.
Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the
absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that
enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without
fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a
pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides
semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a
diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile
signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task
planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision. Code is open-sourced

flexible skill composition, online adaptability, and recovery from task
failures without requiring offline training. Evaluated on the Habitat Benchmark
for mobile manipulation, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across the three long-horizon tasks, demonstrating for the first time that
active inference can scale to the complexity of modern robotics benchmarks.

Conclusion: 高層語義能有效提升人機團隊在複雜任務中的表現，尤其在減輕負荷和加快決策方面具有潛力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of high-level semantics (evaluation
of the environment) on Human-Robot Teams (HRT) and Human-Robot Interaction
(HRI) in the context of mobile robot deployments. Although semantics has been
widely researched in AI, how high-level semantics can benefit the HRT paradigm
is underexplored, often fuzzy, and intractable. We applied a semantics-based
framework that could reveal different indicators of the environment (i.e. how
much semantic information exists) in a mock-up disaster response mission. In
such missions, semantics are crucial as the HRT should handle complex
situations and respond quickly with correct decisions, where humans might have
a high workload and stress. Especially when human operators need to shift their
attention between robots and other tasks, they will struggle to build
Situational Awareness (SA) quickly. The experiment suggests that the presented
semantics: 1) alleviate the perceived workload of human operators; 2) increase
the operator's trust in the SA; and 3) help to reduce the reaction time in
switching the level of autonomy when needed. Additionally, we find that
participants with higher trust in the system are encouraged by high-level
semantics to use teleoperation mode more.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM) that involves the handling of

challenge for real-world robotic applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel Language-conditioned Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation framework, named
LOVMM, incorporating the large language model (LLM) and vision-language model
(VLM) to tackle various mobile manipulation tasks in household environments.
Our approach is capable of solving various OVMM tasks with free-form natural
language instructions (e.g. "toss the food boxes on the office room desk to the
trash bin in the corner", and "pack the bottles from the bed to the box in the
guestroom"). Extensive experiments simulated in complex household environments
show strong zero-shot generalization and multi-task learning abilities of
LOVMM. Moreover, our approach can also generalize to multiple tabletop
manipulation tasks and achieve better success rates compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but
also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this
end, we present the first systematic study of confidence calibration in
vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations
and natural-language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We begin
with extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between
task success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants,
finding that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Next, we
introduce prompt ensembles for VLAs, a lightweight, Bayesian-inspired algorithm
that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions and consistently
improves calibration. We further analyze calibration over the task time
horizon, showing that confidence is often most reliable after making some
progress, suggesting natural points for risk-aware intervention. Finally, we
reveal differential miscalibration across action dimensions and propose
action-wise Platt scaling, a method to recalibrate each action dimension
independently to produce better confidence estimates. Our aim in this study is
to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render
VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty
quantification.

Abstract: Affordances - i.e. possibilities for action that an environment or objects in
it provide - are important for robots operating in human environments to
perceive. Existing approaches train such capabilities on annotated static

common household tasks. Unlike previous approaches, our dataset consists of
video sequences demonstrating the tasks from first- and third-person
perspectives, along with metadata about the affordances that are manifested in
the task, and is aimed towards training perception systems to recognize
affordance manifestations. The demonstrations were collected from several

Abstract: Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents
significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object
shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where
traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we
propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor
mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles
naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to
distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results
is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion
prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and
a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A
query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently
predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric
formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic
objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding
box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom
indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects
  and dynamic elements like robots and miscellaneous items, showcasing its
potential for robust indoor scene understanding.

Abstract: Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) algorithms in popular commercial
software typically treat a Region of Interest (RoI) only as a 2D plane,
ignoring important3D structure characteristics. This leads to incomplete
3Dreconstructions, especially around occluded or vertical surfaces. In this
paper, we propose a modular algorithm that can extend commercial
two-dimensional path planners to facilitate terrain-aware planning by adjusting
altitude and camera orientations. To demonstrate it, we extend the well-known
DARP (Divide Areas for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning) algorithm
and produce DARP-3D. We present simulation results in multiple 3D environments
and a real-world flight test using DJI hardware. Compared to baseline, our
approach consistently captures improved 3D reconstructions, particularly in
areas with significant vertical features. An open-source implementation of the

Abstract: To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal
reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing
vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow
their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible
reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading
manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,
Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal
training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual
reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated
650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves
30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce
SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and
high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA
by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA
surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling
by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both
simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's
potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with
efficient policy learning.

Abstract: Robust relocalization in dynamic outdoor environments remains a key challenge
for autonomous systems relying on 3D lidar. While long-term localization has
been widely studied, short-term environmental changes, occurring over days or
weeks, remain underexplored despite their practical significance. To address
this gap, we present a highresolution, short-term multi-temporal dataset
collected weekly from February to April 2025 across natural and semi-urban
settings. Each session includes high-density point cloud maps, 360 deg
panoramic images, and trajectory data. Projected lidar scans, derived from the
point cloud maps and modeled with sensor-accurate occlusions, are used to
evaluate alignment accuracy against the ground truth using two Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) variants: Point-to-Point and Point-to-Plane. Results show
that Point-to-Plane offers significantly more stable and accurate registration,
particularly in areas with sparse features or dense vegetation. This study
provides a structured dataset for evaluating short-term localization
robustness, a reproducible framework for analyzing scan-to-map alignment under
noise, and a comparative evaluation of ICP performance in evolving outdoor
environments. Our analysis underscores how local geometry and environmental
variability affect localization success, offering insights for designing more
resilient robotic systems.

Abstract: Neurorehabilitation conventionally relies on the interaction between a
patient and a physical therapist. Robotic systems can improve and enrich the
physical feedback provided to patients after neurological injury, but they
under-utilize the adaptability and clinical expertise of trained therapists. In
this position paper, we advocate for a novel approach that integrates the
therapist's clinical expertise and nuanced decision-making with the strength,
accuracy, and repeatability of robotics: Robot-mediated physical Human-Human
Interaction. This framework, which enables two individuals to physically
interact through robotic devices, has been studied across diverse research
groups and has recently emerged as a promising link between conventional manual
therapy and rehabilitation robotics, harmonizing the strengths of both
approaches. This paper presents the rationale of a multidisciplinary
team-including engineers, doctors, and physical therapists-for conducting
research that utilizes: a unified taxonomy to describe robot-mediated
rehabilitation, a framework of interaction based on social psychology, and a
technological approach that makes robotic systems seamless facilitators of
natural human-human interaction.

Abstract: Global optimization has gained attraction over the past decades, thanks to
the development of both theoretical foundations and efficient numerical
routines to cope with optimization problems of various complexities. Among
recent methods, Kernel Sum of Squares (KernelSOS) appears as a powerful
framework, leveraging the potential of sum of squares methods from the
polynomial optimization community with the expressivity of kernel methods
widely used in machine learning. This paper applies the kernel sum of squares
framework for solving control and estimation problems, which exhibit poor local
minima. We demonstrate that KernelSOS performs well on a selection of problems
from both domains. In particular, we show that KernelSOS is competitive with
other sum of squares approaches on estimation problems, while being applicable
to non-polynomial and non-parametric formulations. The sample-based nature of
KernelSOS allows us to apply it to trajectory optimization problems with an
integrated simulator treated as a black box, both as a standalone method and as
a powerful initialization method for local solvers, facilitating the discovery
of better solutions.

Motivation: 准确的事件检测对半被动和动力假肢设计至关重要，简化膝关节模型会丢失部分行为特征。

Result: 发现韧带拉伸与速度相关，步态周期中的静态事件可作为预测初始接触和足平的先兆。

Conclusion: 双髁膝关节设计可提高步态事件检测准确性，从而提升动力假肢控制器的精度。

Abstract: Accurate event detection is key to the successful design of semi-passive and
powered prosthetics. Kinematically, the natural knee is complex, with
translation and rotation components that have a substantial impact on gait
characteristics. When simplified to a pin joint, some of this behaviour is
lost. This study investigates the role of cruciate ligament stretch in event
detection. A bicondylar knee design was used, constrained by analogues of the
anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. This offers the ability to
characterize knee kinematics by the stretch of the ligaments. The ligament
stretch was recorded using LVDTs parallel to the ligaments of the Russell knee
on a bent knee crutch. Which was used to capture data on a treadmill at 3
speeds. This study finds speed dependence within the stretch of the cruciate
ligaments, prominently around 5\% and 80\% of the gait cycle for the posterior
and anterior. The cycle profile remains consistent with speed; therefore, other
static events such as the turning point feature at around 90\% and 95\% of the
cycle, for the posterior and anterior, respectively, could be used as a
predictive precursor for initial contact. Likewise at 90\% and 95\%, another
pair of turning points that in this case could be used to predict foot flat.
This concludes that the use of a bicondylar knee design could improve the
detection of events during the gait cycle, and therefore could increase the
accuracy of subsequent controllers for powered prosthetics.

Abstract: Autonomous drones have gained considerable attention for applications in
real-world scenarios, such as search and rescue, inspection, and delivery. As
their use becomes ever more pervasive in civilian applications, failure to
ensure safe operation can lead to physical damage to the system, environmental
pollution, and even loss of human life. Recent work has demonstrated that
motion planning techniques effectively generate a collision-free trajectory
during navigation. However, these methods, while creating the motion plans, do
not inherently consider the safe operational region of the system, leading to
potential safety constraints violation during deployment. In this paper, we
propose a method that leverages run time safety assurance in a kinodynamic
motion planning scheme to satisfy the system's operational constraints. First,
we use a sampling-based geometric planner to determine a high-level
collision-free path within a user-defined space. Second, we design a low-level
safety assurance filter to provide safety guarantees to the control input of a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed with the purpose of trajectory
tracking. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a restricted 3D simulation
environment using a model of the Crazyflie 2.0 drone.

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with
deep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from
crop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they
require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world
field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant
human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this
challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during
model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to
diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we
hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to
suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with
frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we
propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)
which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed
around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level
contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our
extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that
masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and
significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual
navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward
crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and
generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction
in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the
number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks
to maximize overall performance.
