Such descriptions of normative driving behaviors can aid in the\ndevelopment of vehicle safety and intelligent transportation systems. The\nmethodology is demonstrated using data from the Second Strategic Highway\nResearch Program (SHRP 2) NDS, which includes over 34 million miles of driving\nacross more than 3,400 drivers. Summaries of each driving metric were generated\nusing vehicle, GPS, and forward radar data. Additionally, interactive online\nanalytics tools were developed to visualize and compare driving behavior across\ngroups through dynamic data selection and grouping. For example, among drivers\non 65-mph roads for the SHRP 2 NDS, females aged 16-19 exceeded the speed limit\nby 7.5 to 15 mph slightly more often than their male counterparts, and younger\ndrivers maintained headways under 1.5 seconds more frequently than older\ndrivers.

Traditionally,\nqueuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand\nand fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during\ncongestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a\nfactor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an\nanalytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging\nof autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the\nfirst time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the\nmulti-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed\nform formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue\nlength and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a\ncrash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential\ncollisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective.\nFinally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly\nminimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision\nvariables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is\nformulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to\nfind the minimum cost solution.

This study\ninvestigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help\nstandardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were\ncollected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data\nconsists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a\ncorresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data\npre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and\noptionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.\nAfterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural\nnetwork, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final\nsocket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the\nsocket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's\nperformance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the\nAI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.\nFirst, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface\nerror between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.\nSecond, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are\nutilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the\nrequired adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.\nThe random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest\nerror with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first\nquartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528AI\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5c0f\u817f\u5047\u80a2\u63a5\u53d7\u8154\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u4fee\u6574\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u7ec8\u5f62\u72b6\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5047\u80a2\u63a5\u53d7\u8154\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6280\u5e08\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u9002\u914d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0cAI\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6118\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u540e\u4f7f\u75283D\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u524d\u9988\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u9884\u6d4b\u63a5\u53d7\u8154\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u4fee\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u9884\u6d4b\u4fee\u6574\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8868\u9762\u8ddd\u79bb1.24\u6beb\u7c73\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5047\u80a2\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fee\u6574\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002"}}

To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or\none-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps\nnoise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first\nprinciples of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite\nintegrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term\nInterval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential\nrelationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals\nwithout resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we\nintroduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic\nconsistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the\ndifferential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit\nof our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This\nestablishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning\naverage velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is\nsignificantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,\nresulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware\ncompatibility.

Recent\nworks have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with\nlong-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all\nclasses. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,\nwe expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel\ntask of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline\nstate-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.\nSpecifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not\navailable in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a\nclass-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning\nsetting.

TDR\ncomprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of\ndriving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances\ndexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces\nintensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control\nrequires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a\nreconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable\njoints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through\na pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a\ncontinuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively\nactuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates\nthe inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex\ncoordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated\nand compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further\nrevealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and\nvalidation experiments have been conducted.

However, state-of-the-art generative models\n(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of\nexamples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic\ndata, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent\nretraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows\nvia in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no\nparameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,\nintroducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity\nof this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a\nperson-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three\nfoundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four\nbaselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate\nstatistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.\nResults show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.\nLLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at\n1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly\nvulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and\nGPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three\nzero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary\nstatistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up\nto 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity.

In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization.

To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools.

FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces\nchallenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with\nspecialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.\nFew-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by\nminimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include\nbalancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and\nhandling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing\nannotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other\napplications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,\nand data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this\npaper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable\ndeployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FSL\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u548c3D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u548c3D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff08\u5982tube proposals\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5339\u914d\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "FSL\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u548c3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FSL\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches are\nsingle-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based\nmethods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on\nthe Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth\nestimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of\n3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction\nnetwork called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided\nview transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth\ndistributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through\ndiffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and\nselectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified\nregions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses\nfusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for\nfaster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with\nreal-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable\nperformance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating\nits effectiveness and robustness.

We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs).

ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue,\nproactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or\ncorrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal,\ntimestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and\nresolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and\nclarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence\nname screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic\nknowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability\nand accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and\nexisting self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over\n150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness\nfor operational use in rapidly evolving environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARIA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\uff09\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ARIA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bf7\u6c42\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5728TikTok Pay\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cARIA\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ARIA\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the\nbackbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic\nfeatures to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with\nsmall number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of\nmulti-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect\ndetection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to\nshare the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping\nconvolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which\nsignificantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy\nof detection.

Explainable AI (XAI)\nmethods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the\ncauses of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide\nexplanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable\ncountermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based\ncounterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations\nfor network intrusion attacks.

To the best of our knowledge, this work also\npresents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation\nalgorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our\nproposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the\ntested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by\nreducing the time to generate explanations.

Dataset distillation mitigates this by\ncompressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while\npreserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance\nunder fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations\nfor redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier.

While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they\nrequire large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world\nfield deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant\nhuman resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed.

State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via\nvision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised\npre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to\nboost downstream task performance.

Using the exponentially weighted estimation,\nwe leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional\nGAE (DGAE).

Due to\nits low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the\nmainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from\nsignificant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies\nthe negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a\ncritical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect\ntraining. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware\ntime minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the\ncompression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and\ntraining task.

Each human part, such\nas a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into\nothers. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to\ninfer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most\nexisting 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part\nsegmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.\nIn this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a\nkey guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core\ncomponents. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we\npropose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially\nreconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based\non the textureless surface.

Experiments demonstrate\nthat this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and\nUECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized\nFoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).\nFurthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization\ncapabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for\nassembling lightweight food image.", "AI": {"tldr": "Swin-TUNA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u98df\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b04%\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982FoodSAM\uff09\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728Swin Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728FoodSeg103\u548cUECFoodPix Complete\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523050.56%\u548c74.94%\u7684mIoU\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1198.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "Swin-TUNA\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u98df\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing GCIL methods\nprimarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed\nto belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We\nrigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE\nsatisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric\npassive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss\nframework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL).

However,\nthe high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely\nconstrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies\nlike Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful\nstrategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view\nsequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we\npropose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation\nframework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on\nsingle-frame editing and robot state conditions.

ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of\ninnovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we\nintroduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that\nlearns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.\nSecond, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse\nSpatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views\nand remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the\nviews to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,\nwe incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted\nexpert guidance only when necessary.

However, additional examples introduce more noise than\nthey provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a\ncritical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual\ninformation, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine\ncontent, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic\npriors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on\nthe e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.\nAdditionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model\nprovides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with\na BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore\nresults in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of\nthis task.

While some progress has been made, existing methods continue\nto struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural\ndamage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging\nflare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference\nimages in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this\npaper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that\ndecouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,\neffectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists\nmainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local\ndetail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive\nthe frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing\nglobal frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from\ncontent information.

However, existing\nmulti-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training\ntask to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner.

The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR\nrenderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night\nsimulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering\nand LiDAR simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "InvRGB+L\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u548cLiDAR\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u6570\u636e\uff0cLiDAR\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6750\u6599\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002LiDAR\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u503c\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u7167\u660e\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684LiDAR\u7740\u8272\u6a21\u578b\u548cRGB-LiDAR\u6750\u6599\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u7684RGB\u548cLiDAR\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u591c\u95f4\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "InvRGB+L\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u548cLiDAR\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing frameworks suffer from severe\ncomputational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention\nmechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose\nUltra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates\nsparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the\ncompact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in\nthe first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate\nprediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we\nintroduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that\nrestricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.\nThis design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global\nattention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this\nmechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw\nmeshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nUltra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ultra3D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VecSet\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a0\u901f\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u56e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528VecSet\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7565\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08Part Attention\uff09\u7ec6\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u57281024\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65483D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476.7\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "Ultra3D\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
