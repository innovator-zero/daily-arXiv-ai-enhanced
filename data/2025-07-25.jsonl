However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93.

Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate\nvarious proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to\nstructured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at\nhttps://github.com/andrew-pengjj/modified_nuclear_norm."}

However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle.

In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain\nsufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity\nsearch. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,\nenabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,\nresampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using\npotential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating\nmulti-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity\nshow a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75).

To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images.

Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod\ndataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson\ncorrelations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six\nout-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture\nobtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second\noverall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge."}

While\nexisting methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable\nprogress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail\nto leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we\npropose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework\nfeaturing an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses\nprediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding\nupdate mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units\nper sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential\nhistorical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into\nclean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and\ndual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's\nconvergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and\nreal-world benchmarks."}

Many face\ndetection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,\nand plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable\nlighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and\nprecisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe\nalgorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a\nrobotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and\nthe phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate\nthat the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting\nsignificantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch\nangles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise\ndetection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion\non the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical\nprocedures."}

The synergistic\nreasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation\nModels (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.\nNevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic\ngranularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,\n(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for\nsemantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and\nMLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs\nhierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse\nmanipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability\nand generalization.

Since\ntheir internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively\nexplore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.\nWhile existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive\narticulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the\ngeometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual\nperception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and\nmechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.\nTo address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that\nleverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater\nlocal geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual\naffordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we\nconstruct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance\nmodel. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in\nfoundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level\ncontrol codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance\ninference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong\ngeneralization ability across novel articulated object categories."}
