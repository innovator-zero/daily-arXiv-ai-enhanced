However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "QuaRC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u5206\u6570\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "QuaRC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u5206\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-1K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cQuaRC\u57281%\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u91cf\u5316ResNet-18\u81f32\u6bd4\u7279\u65f6\uff0cTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u53475.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "QuaRC\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy.

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities.

All data are\nharmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and\nsegmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.\nWe systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering\nthe YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.\nEvaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and\nmAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and\ninference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results\nhighlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,\nas well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of\ndifferent architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a\nCLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment\nto dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each\ninput image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance\nwithout requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for\nreal-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible\nplatform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All\ndatasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to\nfacilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "FishDet-M\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u9c7c\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e8613\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8628\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u4e0b\u9c7c\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u540813\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528COCO\u98ce\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3028\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165CLIP-based\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cCLIP-based\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u96c6\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "FishDet-M\u4e3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To address\nthese challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for\nsemantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and\nMLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs\nhierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances.

However, this single-point preview tracking strategy\nfails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control\nactions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its\ncontrol performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.\nTraditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between\ncapturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often\nresulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.\nThis method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a\nLinear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input\nbased on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC\ncalculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by\nadding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and\ninterpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance\noptimization through residual modeling.

Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics\nas well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.\nThe derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,\nincluding a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of\nthe Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions\nof SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating\nexcellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,\nwe show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by\nsimply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight\nmatrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the\nperformance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find\nthat they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SETOL\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86SOTA\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cfERG\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eHTSR\u7684alpha\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91caSOTA\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fHTSR\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684alpha\u548calpha-hat\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u5b66\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecERG\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u5c42MLP\u548cSOTA NN\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SETOL\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u663e\u793aERG\u4e0eHTSR\u7684alpha\u5ea6\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SETOL\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cfERG\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Traditional\ndeepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized\ndeepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against\nmalicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that\nintegrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations\nwithin a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models.

In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that\nautoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language\ninputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including\nVideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information\nfrom prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual\ncross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted\nfrom the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level\nsummaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use\nof sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,\nenabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and\nneural responses.

In this study, we propose a novel framework for\ntortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the\nevaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative\napplication scenario.\n  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework\nthat integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates\ndomain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation\nscenarios.

To\naddress this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively \"squeezing\" 16-bit LLMs'\nweights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits\nper weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits.

In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation\n(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts\nadaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by\ncapturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in\ntarget domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into\ngraph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,\nadaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency\ncomponents, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions.

To effectively capture\nlong-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically\nprunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution\nalong the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while\nmaintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training\nstrategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities.

These models are trained on\nlarge-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge\nvisual perception and natural language processing. However, their application\nto scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly\nused in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce\nFieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'\nunderstanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a\nfield-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model\ntuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a\nspecial-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from\nfield data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.\nThis information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that\nserve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on\nLVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to\nreduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative\nvalues.

Accurate estimation of a State of Health\n(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability\nand safety.

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models.

Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first\napplies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based\nconceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear\nregression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that\nensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%\nof basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower\nuncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).\nThese results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not\nnecessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is\nassembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction.

This task requires estimating multiple material\nmaps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of\nconstraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.\nPrevious works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for\ntraining, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to\nrendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial\nmaterial results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a\nfinetuning model.

To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408V-JEPA\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSL\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002V-JEPA\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u5408\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46ViT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408V-JEPA\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aViT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728100%\u548c10%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd3.4%\u548c8.35%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408V-JEPA\u548c3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks.

In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples.

While existing work\nhas made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as\nHTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software\nstill remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation\nusually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control\nspecific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to\nhandle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.\nTo address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel\nrequirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal\ntraceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis\nis built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a\ngranular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural\nlanguage requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a\ncomprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of\n3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification\nlanguage capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D\nsoftware synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis\nenables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic\nconstraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis\naccurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%\nof hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.\nFurthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual\nevaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Scenethesis\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u76843D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00ScenethesisLang\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9700\u6c42\u6355\u6349\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fee\u6539\u7279\u5b9a\u5143\u7d20\u6216\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eScenethesisLang\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u5c063D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "result": "Scenethesis\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u634980%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db390%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534742.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "Scenethesis\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}
