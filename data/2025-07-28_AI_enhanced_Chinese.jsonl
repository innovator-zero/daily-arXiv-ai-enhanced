When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these\nmodels can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,\na novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems\nusing a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise\nfunction of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different\napproximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to\neffectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance\nterm. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,\nthe proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of\ninverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise\ninto the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,\nspecifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional\ndiffusion model for recovery, compared to the \\pgdm baseline, the proposed\nframework achieves a reduction in inference time of \\(25\\%\\) for inpainting\nwith both random and center masks, and \\(23\\%\\) and \\(24\\%\\) for \\(4\\times\\)\nand \\(8\\times\\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only\nnegligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6bb5\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u9879\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0825%\u81f324%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14PSNR\u548cSSIM\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u3002"}}

This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics.

Despite the\nsuccess of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not\nyet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data\nhas an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the\nobservation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology\n``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we\npropose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by\nretained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be\nintegrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is\nupper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both\nstructured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we\nfurther find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for\nassessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the\namount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results.

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy.

Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --\ni.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,\nwe derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism\nand propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow\nmatching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed\nequivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated\nand real-world experiments.

In parallel, the field of human parsing\nfocuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This\nwork aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic\nsegmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground\ntruth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are\nfirst aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the\nresulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to\nproduce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations.

There are\nstrong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned\nreinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a\nlarge number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each\ntest episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that\nperformance can be substantially improved through test-time training,\nspecializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time\noffline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead\nto substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel\nself-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an\noffline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality\nwith respect to the evaluation goal.

However, the traditional centralized\nlearning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and\ntrained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized\napproaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing\nmodel training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these\nmethods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data\nand suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the\naggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of\nclinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously\nlearning from diverse modalities and multilabels.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

In practice, when humans attempt to\npredict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory\non a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner.

Motivated by the human learning process, we\npropose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so\nthat the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak\nmodels. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,\nwe further construct ``trajectory trees,\" a hierarchical representation that\norganizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,\nwe provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving\nW2SG performance.

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to\nlearn through trial and error in simulation.

Additionally, current\nscenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a\nbalance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which\nprogressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising\napproach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.\nHowever, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,\nfocusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.\nThis work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum\nlearning.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured.

Traditional deep learning models, such\nas long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle\nto generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a\nmore adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce\nKolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes\n(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse\nspline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework\nidentifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,\nenabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs\nKolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate\nprice behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved\nthrough symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts\nhuman-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial\ntime series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a\nSharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming\nexisting methods.

By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the\nentire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to\nestimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road\nregion. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm.

The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm\nof imputation and refinement.

Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned\nembedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some\nattributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we\nestablish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable\nRefinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated\nto reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the\nsampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation\nnodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters.

Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying\nalgorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,\nand struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental\nconditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to\ninconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and\ndata-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language\nmodels (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their\npromise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including\ndifficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,\nfrequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking\nlots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and\nquantification.

Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best\npre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%\non F1 and 4.0% on accuracy.

Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This\ncompositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural\nprinciples underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:\nhttps://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8303\u7574\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f55\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8303\u7574\uff08MCs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u6563\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eNLL\u8bad\u7ec3\u9690\u542b\u4e86\u8c31\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u539f\u7406\u3002"}}

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner.

In medicine, these models can admit\nconflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly\nunderstood and insufficiently addressed.\n  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications\nof predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model\narchitectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate\npredictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard\nvalidation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a\nsubstantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model\ndevelopment.

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness.

Specifically, many\nreal-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or\nnon-existent, \\eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific\nconditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale\ntraining, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.\nTo address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the\nscarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive\ndata containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions\ndemand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable\nwidespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically\nobserve that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the\naffirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware\nTest-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related\nparameters during inference.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

In this work, we introduce a systematic,\ncircuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual\nsemantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our\nframework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing\ncircuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we\ndiscover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object\ntokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.\nFurthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions\nemerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.\nIn contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we\nreveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional\nlocalization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant\nmechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a\nfoundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46LVLMs\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7535\u8def\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7535\u8def\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d41\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe92.6%\uff1b\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLVLMs\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

However, identifying\n3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite\nexplicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud\nbackbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to\nadequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the\ndisparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data\nsimply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth\nand appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the\nflexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly\nGenerator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies\nin RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,\neffectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can\ndirectly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.\nExperiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD\nand Eyecandies datasets.

However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,\nmost notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel\ndistinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art\nreconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone\nautomatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches\nbased on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic\nreconstructions in the sparse-view setting.

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u6210\u5206\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u53d1\u578b\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5355\u76ee\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u8868\u8fbe\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
