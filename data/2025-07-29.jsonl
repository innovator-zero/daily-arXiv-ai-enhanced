This underrepresentation is revealed in\nthis study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark\ndifferences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the\nconventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS\ntrajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for\nindividuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal\nembeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to\ncapture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent\nbiases in conventional transportation datasets.

This\nabsence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale\nhydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for\naccurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.\nGiven this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and\nreliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because\nharsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity\nfluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable\nenergy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial\nIntelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available\nmeteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),\nwhich predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen\ninfrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational\ndecision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate\nperformance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk\nintelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical\noperational benchmarks."}

They are often organized\nusing key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation\nview, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized\nsymbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite\nadvances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing\nremains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we\nintroduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings\nemploying a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts\nto enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is\ncapable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these\nto extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired\nstructural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and\nevaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural\ndrawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly\nreducing the workload compared to current working process associated with\nmanual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of\nengineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way."}

Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Although some attempts address this by designing more\nsophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on\nlabeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we\npropose a novel unsupervised framework, \"Aggregation-aware Multilayer\nPerceptron\" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting\naggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight\napproach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction\nmethod that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a\nsingle-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby\nimproving the capacity and applicability of the model.

In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

These components work\nsynergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a\nmulti-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image\ncolor information.

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest.

Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal\nMulti-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB\ndata with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,\nsegmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate\ninformation-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in\nLLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at\nhttps://github.com/albrateanu/ModalFormer."}

In this paper semantic segmentation has\nbeen performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled\non the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more\nchallenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on\nunstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this\npaper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models\nhave been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean\nIntersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and\nSegNet.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To\nmitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase\napproximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned\ndata traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from\n\"pseudo-convergence\", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but\nstill preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification\nand generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach\nmaintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack\naccuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full\nretraining from scratch."}

Such data fusion methods for distributed\nquantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a\nlinear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural\nnetworks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The\nnetwork training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data\nusually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse\nbut more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation\ndata to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step\ninvolves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic\nerrors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of\nthe entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer\nperceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established\nmethod based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical\nsolutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides\nsolutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight\nmechanical design, structural sizing, and certification.

Its numerical stability can be\nimproved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows\nand columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how\naccurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,\nthus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early\ntermination.

This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental\nHierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework\nthat incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated\nclusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online\ndivisive-agglomerative clustering based on \\textit{Jaccard} similarity and a\nglobal tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \\textit{Bernoulli} process\nto guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates\ndrift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic\nrestructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23\nreal-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global\nbaselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\\%, and 12 local\nbaselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and\nADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\\%, establishing its robustness for\nonline multi-label classification."}

First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct."}

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency.

Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.

Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes.

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios.
