This underrepresentation is revealed in\nthis study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark\ndifferences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the\nconventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS\ntrajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for\nindividuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal\nembeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to\ncapture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent\nbiases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the\ngenerated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from\nLos Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics).

However,\nautomated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from\nthe inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of\nlivers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,\nwe present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder\nNetwork (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet\nleverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive\nencoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating\nchannel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A\nTransformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual\nrelationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale\nfeature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.\nMorphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct\nboundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding\nprecise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed\non two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb.

However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors\ncan cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent\n(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to\naddress three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning\nframeworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)\ninherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in\nannotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide\nthe agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.\nUsing the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can\ndynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.\nSpecifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model\ndistribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula\nrelated to the degeneracy factor.

The skin sensors employed in this study\npossess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple\ncontact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is\nanticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions\nexhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot\nmotion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by\naltering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this\npaper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing\nrecurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success\nof this framework.

Secondly, it is essential to\nmount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the\nactivation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of\nmeasuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation\nwith other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated\nby the robot's movements during deployment.

To address this\nlimitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario\ngeneration. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to\ncreate, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding\nexpertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as\nScenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports\na broader user base.

In automated mode, the framework can randomly\nsample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,\nallowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets.

To learn effectively, the agent must learn\nto differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and\nminimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters\nassociated with the relevant signals.\n  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to\nassign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the\nstructure of the problem.

Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both\nRGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their\nperformance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To\naddress this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that\nsynthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key\ninsight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow\nmaps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly\ncorrelated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and\nthen convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural\ncues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs\ninto image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available\nfor network training.

However, the roles of existing\ndecoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still\nunderexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number\n(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of\nthese fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between\ntwo attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention\n(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages.

To address\ninter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained\nincreasing attention.

To overcome this challenge, we\nexplore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib\nstructures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone\nsurface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related\nsignals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic\nnoise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile\npoint cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human\npalpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,\nthe sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a\ndenser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an\nimage-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping\nfor individual patients.

Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery\ntrajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and\nresilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral\ncontrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and\nhighly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional\nflood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides\nthe temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial\nmulti-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and\nbare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between\nspectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that\n\\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\\mathbf{14\\%}$,\nreduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$\nprecision of $\\mathbf{86\\%}$, while processing videos $ \\mathbf{9.6\\times} $\nfaster than the most accurate baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edfLava\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SQL\u8303\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "Lava\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLava\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Lava\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address\nthese limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only\ntransformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,\nbypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this\ndecoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and\nthe glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the\ntextual dependencies in the glosses.

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either\ninstance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene\nunderstanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we\npropose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as\nrepresentation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.\n3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of\nGaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing\na flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to\nconstruct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based\nLocalization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize\ncoarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)\nfuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of\ninterest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians\ninto multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing\non sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while\noffering comprehensive scene perception.

Variations in LiDAR types and\ndynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene\nconsistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure\ndetection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging\nframework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,\ndynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A\nvoxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify\nand reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal\nmodule is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved\nstatic local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are\nconducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a\ncentralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during\nmap merging.

Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our\nexperiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain\nto the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In\nthis work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain\nmultimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive\nTarget-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.\nSpecifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal\nvisual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely\nvisual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words\nidentification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative\ncontext words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.\n(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack\nachieves a new SOTA performance.

In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms.

While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)\ndetection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited\nattention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.\nThis work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to\npredict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time\nefficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for\npattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first\nAI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the\naccuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.\nWe particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,\nrespectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear\npattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern\ndeminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the\nBayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a\nBayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,\nRestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing\npattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the\naverage share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time\nthan the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines.

A critical challenge is the\nagent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its\nobjectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for\nreactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to\ncreate queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer\nentities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of\nreasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for\nnormal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved\nin particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts.

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories.

However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are\nusually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have\nbeen widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their\nsuperior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the\nreal-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear\nself-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this\nissue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for\nits adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\nparticularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to\ncombine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate\ngeneration of segmentation masks.

It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios.

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt\ngeneration network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which\nfocuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.\nSpecifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is\ndesigned to extract player-related multimodal embeddings.

Additionally, a visual\ncontext learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context\ninformation. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the\nmultimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the\ngeneration of descriptions with player identities.

To this end, we\nrevisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better\ngeneralization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We\nintroduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and\ndemonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We\nincorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed\ntraining objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to\ncollaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that\ncounteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the\nDistributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF\noutperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better\ngeneralization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient\naveraging, while significantly reducing communication overhead.

To tackle this problem, we propose a combined\nBayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under\na unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the\nhyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple\nevaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each\narm using the Bayesian optimization.

However, recent\nstudies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious\ncorrelations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a\nsimple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We\nquantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the\ncovariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results\nsystemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features\nfed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while\navoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular\nadvantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization\nterms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in\npractice.

A,\n185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling\ndata as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods\nhave proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it\nadditionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these\nbottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a\nbalance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical\nstability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly\nseparated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a\ncomputationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the\nDGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We\nimplement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of\nDGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while\nrequiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable\nalternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal\nhuman intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric\ninformation, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as\nsparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these\nmethods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic\ngranularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal\nautolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the\nsemantic richness of camera images.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce\nSparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction\nthat dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without\nrequiring additional training.

Through leveraging LLM-based prior\nknowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image\nrepresentations, including both global category representation and the\npatch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel\nmulti-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate\nmultiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant\nretrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property\ndescriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token\nlearning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate\nthat our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative\nclass-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "BCT-CLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u540d\u79f0\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08MPG\uff09\u3001LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5c5e\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BCT-CLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration.

This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception.

We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference.

The main processing path of this framework\nintegrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the\nConvolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained\nrepresentation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features\nthrough a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature\nfusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy\ndistribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention\nmapping.

To ensure smoothness and correct color\nordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap\nrepresentation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.\nWe evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset\nand a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --\ncolormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to\nvisualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color\npalettes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece2D\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u989c\u8272\u56fe\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e002D\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e3a\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u548c\u989c\u8272\u987a\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cVIS30K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5e26\u6709\u989c\u8272\u56fe\u4f8b\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions.

In this paper, we first identify two critical\ndeficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation\nbias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of\nsupervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak\nconsistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and\nprototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework.

We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner.

Extensive experiments on\nvarious RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves\neffective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but\nalso exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing\nmodalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "RingMo-Agent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u4e14\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "RingMo-Agent\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RS-VL3M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRingMo-Agent\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RingMo-Agent\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a\ndistilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more\nefficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with\nUnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase\nin the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and\nself-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes.

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,\nwhich uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough\ndescription of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style\nattributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional\nQBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the\ndocument images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.\nExperiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our\nhypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document\nimage retrieval.

Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from\nthe lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity\nreference image randomly selected from the same video.

Variability in\nfactors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle\ntypes, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)\nleads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a\nnovel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images\nand their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our\nkey contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge\ntransfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to\nmitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.\nExtensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent\nperformance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain\ndata, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation\nmethods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than\n50%, respectively.

In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further\npropose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive\nlearning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.\nThis design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption\ninformation while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related\nexpressions.

However, the\nproprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a\nsignificant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nGPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus\ncontaining more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source\nimage, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging\nthe versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular\nimage-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our\nmethodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality\nand instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve\nsemantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune\nadvanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are\nexciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive\nperformance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on\nGEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger\ninstruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.\nThese scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and\nsubstantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models.
