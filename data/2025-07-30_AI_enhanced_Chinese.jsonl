This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach\ninspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice\nand Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall\n(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we\ntermed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the\nmodel's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test\nTFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading\nregularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR\nperforms significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split\nCIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's\n7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,\nwe analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that\nwhile TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay\nvolume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude\nthat TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of\nintegrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TFC-SR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u523b\u610f\u7ec3\u4e60\u548c\u95f4\u9694\u91cd\u590d\u7b49\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u5bf9\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTFC-SR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u56de\u5fc6\u63a2\u9488\uff08Active Recall Probe\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fc7\u53bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Split MNIST\u548cSplit CIFAR-100\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTFC-SR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Split CIFAR-100\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523013.17%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4e3a7.40%\u3002", "conclusion": "TFC-SR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,\ntransforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes\nwithin sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile\nsensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials\nor designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material\nfabrication process.

Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two\ncategories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies\ntoo well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which\ncan suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to\ncouple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate\nobjectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit\ntheir expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically\nsolvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly\naligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated\non two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI\nsubtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,\nhyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,\nnon-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a\nmore clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of\nrobustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and\nscanner/age variations in MRI.

Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based\nexplorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust\nenvironmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D\nenvironments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological\nexplorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the\nenvironment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of\nlearning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we\nincrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based\ninstance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a\nfinite state machine.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local\nConnectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive\nglobal and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,\nwe propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn\nglobal segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.\nThis enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while\nmaintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight\nDual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation\nquality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on\nboth 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy\nand continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism.

The multiplicity of\ninverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of\nauxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most\nwidely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that\ninherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the\ncomputation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all\njoint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant\nmanipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We\nfocus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE\nformulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE\nintegrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in\notherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by\none degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse\nmultiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation\nfrom the latent BEV grid.

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we\ndevise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select\nreliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of\nunlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,\nincluding two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and\npancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a\nchallenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features\ncomplicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches.

Specifically, we integrate a\nneural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed\nneural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential\nequations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal\nrepresentation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and\nsymbolic physical constraints.

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts.

This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy.

To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning.

The dataset suffers from egregious\ndata leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws\nthat invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491\ninactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more\nrepeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).\nCritically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test\ncases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.\nStructural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of\nquery ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9.

Direct preference\noptimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by\naligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies\ntypically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on\nstatic supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to\nsuperficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional\nrigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant\nvisual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a\ntoken-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max\noptimization problem.

Among\nthese approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free\nnature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing\ntest-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with\nabundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying\nthese methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while\ndirectly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper\npersonalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we\npropose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to\nstore embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to\nstore class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each\nclient retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's\ncoordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both\nembedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution\nclients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients.

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a\npromising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,\nexploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural\ninformation.

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments.

We demonstrate that our\ngeneric DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms\nestablished benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while\nrequiring minimal parameter tuning.

We propose a unified taxonomy of\nprompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,\ngrounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals\nthat every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output\nvalidation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by\nhighlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease\nwith which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5de7\u5999\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ed5\u8fc7LLM\u548cT2I\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0cLLM\u548cT2I\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u8d8a\u72f1\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u7531\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u8f7b\u677e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u53d9\u4e8b\u5347\u7ea7\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f2a\u88c5\u3001\u6697\u793a\u94fe\u3001\u865a\u6784\u5192\u5145\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u5982\u4f55\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba1\u6838\u9636\u6bb5\u5747\u53ef\u88ab\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6613\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6613\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Accurately identifying the referent requires\nmultimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,\nand scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively\nleverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the\nreferent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally\naligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a\nsingle line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one\nmodel learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the\nwrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap\nrepresentation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong\nsupervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.\nTo combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing\nEnsemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.\nAdditionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task\nto further enhance referent localization.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often\nrequires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.\nThese limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such\nmethods.

Electrocardiograms\n(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.\nThese are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is\ntime-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area\nhas focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent\ndeep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most\nECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to\nclassify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method\nwas the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science\nChallenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual\nnoise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform\npatterns.

Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through\nautoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such\nas low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex\ninstructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely\nattributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information\nloss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this\nchallenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training\nimage generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with\nautoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate\nartifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete\nautoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image\nand language generation.
