Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics\nfailures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise\nsoftware reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical\nfailures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches\nfor PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and\nfocusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.\nThis paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing\nphysics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions\naddressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of\ndetection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.\nOur contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;\n(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,\nprompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable\ninsights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches.

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have\nrarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained\nquantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for\nmultiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in\nImage Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,\nContent, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains\n40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we\ndevelop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various\ndimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I\nand I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to\ngenerate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among\nmodel-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for\neach type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's\ndimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to\nenhance overall performance.

While soft everting robots have\nbeen widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move\nand deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous\nwork focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation\ncapabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads\nin hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under\ndebris, would represent a significant capability in many applications.

Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future\nwork involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and\noptimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training\nhyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08NF\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u573a\u666f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff08PDF\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u53c2\u6570PDF\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u9650\u5236\u6216\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0cNF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08NF\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u7ef4PDF\u3002", "result": "NF\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08KDE\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "NF\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This setup is more flexible and practical than\nconventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks\ndesigned for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique\ncomplexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and\ndiversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored\nspecifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service\nrobots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and\n46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.\nParticipants performed various human actions in diverse environments at\ndistances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,\nsimulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights\ndue to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to\nadvance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we\npropose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long\ndistances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic\nEllipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human\nactions.

Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to\nestimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered\nweb data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation\nfor data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka\nannealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to\nspecific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka\nmicro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing\nruns of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a\nkey limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data\nscaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across\ncompute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically\nanalyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling\ncurves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can\ninform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition\nmethods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and\navailable compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a\npre-trained model with 7 billion parameters.

The\nobjective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based\ncross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different\nclustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new\ncross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class\nstratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both\nbalanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing\ncross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.\nThe technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification\noutperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though\nit did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,\ntraditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing\nlower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for\nperformance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of\ndifferent clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as\nsuperior.

In contrast, our proposed\nmethod leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based\ngenerative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate\nsegmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling\nmultiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose\npixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This\nsampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,\noffering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive\nsegmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper\ninsights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures.

To address these issue, we propose\nSpectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that\nleverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather\nimage restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge\nfeatures using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via\nSingular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to\neffectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features\nare integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions\nbased on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,\nwe introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather\nremoval and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.\nWe also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel\nattention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise\nrelationships and spatial dependencies.

To ensure the\nreliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to\ndevelop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping\nand face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address\nthese challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates\nthe video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity\nvectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive\ndetection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to\nprocessing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to\nbe genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the\nregistered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that\nemploying a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both\ndetection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our\nexperimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face\nswapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various\nforms of unseen image degradation.

Differentially private stochastic\ngradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a\npronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,\ndegrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been\nproposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control\nknobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization\nlandscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy\nbudget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay\nwithin privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP\noptimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep\nreinforcement learning (RL).

First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches\nand text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized\nfeatures; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and\nglobal conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's\nmulti-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia\nto release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs\nare provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves\nstate-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized\nmetrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its\nunprecedented level of design customization.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOTS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u8349\u56fe\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u901a\u8fc7\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f20\u8fbe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "LOTS\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u5f15\u5bfc\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "LOTS\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "LOTS\u4e3a\u65f6\u5c1a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches.

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we\nintroduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an\niterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence\nlower bound.

Specifically, we\nincorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;\nthrough iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the\ninternal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical\nevaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach\nreconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned\nmodels. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to\n7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on\ntrojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction\nfor reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong\nprior assumptions about triggers.

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic\nto mesh resolution.

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality.

To extend the\nboundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose\nOmnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset\ncontaining 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS\nstands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions\nthat flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on\nunderstanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the\ninclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,\nwe introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the\nchallenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of\naudiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and\nperform reasoning-based segmentation.
