This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses.

DEA introduces two fully learnable directional\nparameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides\nactor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble\ndisagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the\ndirection of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA\nto adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting\naggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate\nDEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from\ninteractive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static\nensemble strategies."}

To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding\nchain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale\nemotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.\nSimultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to\nguide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the\ndiversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce\nthe emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the\nfusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional\ngeneration guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint\ntraining allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the\nunderstanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to\nselect high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained\nmodel, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these\ngeneration-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding\ncapacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.\nThe code for the proposed method is available at\nhttps://github.com/JiuTian-VL/UniEmo."}

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

To\novercome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared\ndataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex\nScenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k\nhigh-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a\nsignificant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex\nscenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to\nincorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise\nevaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance\nanalysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed\ndataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex\nenvironments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only\n35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410\ndataset.

In this\npaper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and\nintroduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).\nWe propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed\n3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D\ntasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with\ngeometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse\nscenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for\nmore efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set\nsettings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and\nachieve new state-of-the-art results.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches.

To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce\nSUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic\nimages based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33\nbird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific\nconcept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied\nDiffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where\nnoise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the\ncorrect bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel\nbenchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,\ncontributing to the development of more robust methods.

Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D\nobjects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation\nquality compared to existing methods.

We demonstrate that\nwhile optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually\nwith targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image\ncaptioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized\naudio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and\nincoherent.
