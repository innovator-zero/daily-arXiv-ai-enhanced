To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate\nsystematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare\nearth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially\nheterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree\nconversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\\deg}C average\nchange in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further\nreveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover\nproportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,\nfine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling\nscenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSM-UTCI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u57ce\u5e02\u70ed\u5e94\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6237\u5916\u70ed\u5e94\u529b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGSM-UTCI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5730\u8868\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6c14\u8c61\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FiLM\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4bUTCI\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230R2 0.9151\u548cMAE 0.41\u00b0C\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u7f29\u77ed\u81f35\u5206\u949f\u5185\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d39\u57ce\u7eff\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u6e29\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GSM-UTCI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based\ncomputation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations\non K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and\nfull-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier\ndetection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and\nsmallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.\n  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,\n7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the\nA100 GPU and Atom, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "KLLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7K-Means\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "KLLM\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u5904\u7406K-Means\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Orizuru\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cKLLM\u76f8\u6bd4A100 GPU\u548cAtom\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b09.67x\u548c7.03x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347229.50x\u548c150.21x\u3002", "conclusion": "KLLM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for\npredefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in\nharnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily\non the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and\nrefinement.

Recent\nrobotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to\nincrease data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse\nmorphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified\ntraining challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics\nDiffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data\nto enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale\negocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations\nprovide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and\ncan benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,\nand (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action\nencoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B\nparameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.\nExtensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,\nsingle-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and\nrobustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from\nscratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving\nsignificant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in\nsimulation and real-world experiments, respectively.

Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band.

While deep learning-based detection\nmethods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the\ninadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for\ndiverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for\nsmall-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and\ncomputational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for\nefficient, real-time detection in practical applications.

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has\nemerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of\nindividual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,\nthis approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the\nnecessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training\nsamples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and\nscenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the\ndifficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that\nmemorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link\nbetween memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This\nconnection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of\nincremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in\nunlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on\nmore efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned\ncognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence\nApproximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from\nthe incremental perspective.

While traditional\nnumerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise\naccuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,\nwhich is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder.

Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to\nconnect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and\nthe last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions.

Furthermore, we introduce\nlatent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate\nthe state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This\ndesign substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the\nslow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate\nthat FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment\ndetection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%\non OLS).", "AI": {"tldr": "FASTopoWM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5feb\u901f-\u6162\u901f\u8f66\u9053\u6bb5\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u9053\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f66\u9053\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFASTopoWM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u6162\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u548cBEV\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenLane-V2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f66\u9053\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08mAP 37.4%\uff09\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\uff08OLS 46.3%\uff09\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FASTopoWM\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u9053\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This challenge arises due to variations in imaging\nconditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical\ndeployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images\ntypically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with\ndomain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique\ncharacteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.\n  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework\ntailored for medical image segmentation.

Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction\nselector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate\ndomain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.\nFurthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively\napplied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation\nperformance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the\noriginal predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the\nreliability of the segmentation.\n  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our\nframework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,\nachieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse\nclinical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8bed\u4e49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,\nthe traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,\nresulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional\nconvolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution\nclasses; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small\ntargets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract\nmulti-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage\nframework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For\ntraffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable\nvision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to\nspecifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For\ntraffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal\nContrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL).

While extensively\nresearched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models\nused on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains\nunderexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on\nconvolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge\nenvironments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and\ndepthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and\naccommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to\ncompare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT\nmethods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in\nmind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions.

Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)\nmodels, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging\ndigital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these\ntalkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these\nissues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest\nAGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent\nT2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After\nexcluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset\ncontains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the\nAGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for\nsubjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in\nterms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of\nexisting AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the\nfirst frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed.

Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have\nshown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free\ncompression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision\nand language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in\nLVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer\npruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find\nthat non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps\npose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL\ntokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only\nachieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also\nexhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and\nhighly compatible.

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches.

To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically.

However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust\nreasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data\nand the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we\npropose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of\n3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with\nCoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine\nbased on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.\nMoreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning\ntraining process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward\nfunctions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format\nreward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.\nFurthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively\nchooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%\nacross various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing\nreasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing\nliterature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating\nannotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.\nThe results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and\nfatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,\nand the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not\nusing internal factors.

Most 3D\ndata simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to\ncapture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning\nan implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,\nbut progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work\nexplores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called\nStable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator.

In this\npaper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and\nintroduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).\nWe propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed\n3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D\ntasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with\ngeometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse\nscenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for\nmore efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set\nsettings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and\nachieve new state-of-the-art results.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space\nmodel called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame\nsequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on\nspatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial\nfeatures for efficient and accurate VCOD.

Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps.

Project Page:\n  https://imnotprepared.github.io/research/25_DSR/", "summary": "We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view\nvideos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of\ncalibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are\nprohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.\nIn contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a\nbike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene\ncoverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that\ndense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view\nsetup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,\nwe carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to\nproduce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive\nexperiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method\nachieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when\nrendering novel views.

Project page: https://gvfdiffusion.github.io/", "summary": "In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that\ncreates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D\ndiffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and\nthe high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and\nmotion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS\nVariation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and\ntheir temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,\nand compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.\nBuilding upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation\nField diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on\ninput videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D\nobjects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation\nquality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable\ngeneralization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on\nsynthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.\nProject page: https://gvfdiffusion.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u60013D\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff08GS\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864D\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a54D\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c3D\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u800c\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Objaverse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u753b3D\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
