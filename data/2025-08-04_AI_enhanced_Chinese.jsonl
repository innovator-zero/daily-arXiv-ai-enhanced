To this end,\nhere we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two\nspatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to\ndevelop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which\nenforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared\nto both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved\nrobustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)\ngreater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)\nstronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations\npositioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in\norientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,\nindicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational\ngeometry of the network.

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

We present\nthe Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as\nRAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot\ngripper while removing the gripper and the background.

This paper proposes a\nnovel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control\nmodel that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with\nthe idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only\nstrengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach\nconsists of three parts.

Then we decouple the\nwhole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a\nlower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP\nmethod in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the\nbalance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize\nthe robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy.

Here we define structured graph \"lineages\" (ordered\nby level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number\nof graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)\nbipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in\nmultigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using\nprolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures\nbetween graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of \"graded\ngraphs\" can be defined, and using it low-cost \"skeletal\" variants of standard\nalgebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,\ndisjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence\nhierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar\nbut not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard\ncounterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can\napproach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on\ngraded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of\nmultiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers\n(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining \"skeletal\"\nfunctions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and\n(hierarchical) graph lineages.

Existing\ninterpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often\nrequire or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant\nlimitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like\nbackdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.\n  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and\ncontrolling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,\nthereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the\nunknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the\nweight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to\nnewly acquired behaviors.

These systems aim\nto reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain\ndegrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising\napproach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying\ndata collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,\nhowever, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity\nrestoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained\nscenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on\nmanually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an\nimitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling\nobject grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the\nHannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and\nhuman-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single\ndiffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist\norientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates\nsuccessful grasps across diverse objects and conditions.

In this paper, we\nassume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage\nframework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise\nwithout model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor\n(kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good\nperformance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated\nby the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper,\nfollowing a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by\nreliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be\nachieved by introducing geometry information.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.

Under the setting of online convex optimization, several\nalgorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.\nHowever, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only\nhandle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,\nwhich hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,\nwhich automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially\nconcave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary\nor changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual\nadaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and\naggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a\nsecond-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further\nincorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing\nenvironments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies\n(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to\nachieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able\nto minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions\nsimultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.\nMoreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,\nand develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of\ncomposite functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5355\u4e00\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7761\u7720\u4e13\u5bb6\u6280\u672f\u6355\u6349\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u79cd\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u8f6e\u6b21\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5728\u7ebf\u590d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

But, similarly to other forms,\ntabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious\nperformance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the\nmost effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the\nunder-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed\nGAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the\nreal data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,\nthe class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical\nvariables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less\neffective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a\nconditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,\nctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input\nsamples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a\nnovel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes\nboth cluster and class mis-predictions.

Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in\nhandling complex tasks with limited data availability.

Our approach features three key innovations: (1)\ndecomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products,\nenabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier\nspectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency\ncapture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to\nquantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems\nincluding Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and\nNavier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of\nmagnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\\%\nand training time by 60\\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective\nsolution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving.

This issue limits the\nquality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of\nautoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key\ninnovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a\ntraining-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the\nlatent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter\nlatent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an\naugmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training\nobjectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence.

The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects.

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones.

Our multi-regional\ninpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions\nwithin a diffusion model.

However, most existing GDA methods rely\non the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world\nscenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely\nimpairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain\nshifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels.

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,\ndetecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across\ntimepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS\nscore. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics\nclinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and\nBIRADS scores.

However, these methods struggle when dynamic\nobjects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose\nestimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a\ncommonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects\nand occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional\nuncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the\nuncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty\nmust be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify\nunreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end\napproach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame\nuncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework.

To address this\nissue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch\ndefense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object\ndetectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial\npatch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive\nanalyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against\nnaturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly\nbelieved high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can\nbe used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average\nprecision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch\ndetection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)\nAdaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with\ncomplex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.\nWe hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch\nattacks/defenses and advancing their design.

We conclude\nthat reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates\nstandardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address\ndata heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u6807\u8bb0\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u8bb0\u76843D\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528KPConv\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5206\u7ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7IoU\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u51e0\u4f55\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u697c\u68af\u3001\u7a97\u6237\uff09\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}
