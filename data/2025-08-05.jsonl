While data-driven findings in AI\noffer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many\nare difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is\nthe uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science\nlife cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for\nthis uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework\nfor veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to\naddressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated\nand streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with\nguided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS\nframework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the\nuncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data\ncleaning stage."}

They pre-train feedforward models on\nraw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of\nevents. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training\nframework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is\nwell-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long\nevent sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling\nparadigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to\naccumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic\ninformation about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and\nreduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to\nreason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nstate-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection.

During training,\nactions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using\npreference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the\npreferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive\nnavigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to\nalign with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,\nwe deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline\nlearned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a\nmodel-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward\nas an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both\nlearning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments\non a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained\nwith HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not\npresent in the training data.

HHN splits sequences into timestamped\nsegments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured\nvia hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node\nheterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution\nto extract high-order dependencies.

At its core,\nMORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected\nomics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful\ncross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to\nhistopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,\nseamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables\nany-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred\nfrom any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large\npan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a\npromising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.\nThe code is available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/MORPHEUS"}

To address these two issues, this paper\nintroduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge\ngraph as a representation of the world state.

In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the\nresults indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,\nhighlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry\ntasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct\ndatasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational\nframework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better\nunderstand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships.

Such manipulation requires both\neffectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and\nefficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.\nExisting approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods\nrelying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering\nstructural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust\nmanipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through\nreactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces\nTacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated\nobject manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous\napproaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals\nrequiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources\nof local kinematic information.

To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature\nmap sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of\nkey sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention\ncomputation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to\nsimulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.\nFinally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines\nit with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.\nThrough visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO\n2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is\ndemonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both\ninference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is\n5x that of MobileViT-X."}

Secondly, we present an \"inverse\nprompt\" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,\ninverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a\nnovel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs\nby marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial\ndimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of\nregistering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,\nas a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and\ntarget registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration\noutperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based\nDDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with\nweakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data."}

We benchmark on DistilBERT\nand Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,\nARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an\n840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a\n5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a\n3-8\\% speed overhead.

To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt.

Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead.

We construct realistic\ncrosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed\nsurveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting\npedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial\nconditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing\nnormal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or\naltered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while\nsimple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,\nparticularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade\npedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nadversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real\npedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections.

To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be\nused to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.\nThis degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely\non real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is\ninfluenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,\nsuggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response\nto these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called\nPrecision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera\ncaptures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits\nthem to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for\nsafety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax."}

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of\nnatural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a\nwider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount\nof data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,\nwe present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few\ndemonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides\nobject-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the\nobject, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an\ninstance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image\ncrops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target\nobjects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on\nboth simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned\nwith a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates\nzero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios."}

However,\nthese approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the\nclinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to\nmake diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or\n``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these\nnuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for\nhandling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the\nproblem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important\nissue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better\nincorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image\nanalysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of\nclinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert\nuncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which\nsignificantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art\napproaches."}

The source code and model weights will be\n  publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer", "summary": "Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are\nsuitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with\ncomplex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training\ndata-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration\nchallenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems\ntailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose\nQuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for\nquadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of\nquadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,\nproviding a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively\ncapture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during\nquadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts\ncontrollable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and\nprovides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video\ngeneration under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller\n(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter\ncontrol through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in\nwide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream\narchitecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail\nenhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.\nWe further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training\ndata for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the\nperformance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

We performed the first\nlarge-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain\nMRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes\nverifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal\nsources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical\nlesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals\nsystematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM\nconsistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest\nincompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate\nthat these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design\nprinciples tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for\nneuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,\nwhich makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently\naccurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this\ndomain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation\nand validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior\nneuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and\nprovide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging."}
