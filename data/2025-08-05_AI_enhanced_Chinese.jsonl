While data-driven findings in AI\noffer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many\nare difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is\nthe uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science\nlife cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for\nthis uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework\nfor veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to\naddressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated\nand streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with\nguided use of generative AI.

The results indicate that nearly\nall articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key\ndimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the\ndataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers\nshare a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the\npublications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no\nsignificant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to\npublications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the\nneed for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training\nfor researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote\ntransparency and reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5b66\u79d1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u62ab\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u6587\u7ae0\u56e0\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\uff0c72%\u672a\u8bf4\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ec5\u4e24\u7bc7\u5171\u4eab\u4ee3\u7801\uff08\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u7bc7\u94fe\u63a5\u5931\u6548\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6307\u5357\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u57f9\u8bad\u4ee5\u53ca\u671f\u520a\u548c\u4f1a\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

Model-based\napproaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects\nunder contact constraints.

Prior methods retrieve\ndata using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best\ndemonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in\nvisual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a\nsubset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental\ndemonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene\nlayouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We\npresent COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation\nlearning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of\nrelevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.\nCOLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to\nsubsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,\nappearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained\non each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations.

One of their prominent applications\nin traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky\ndriving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows\nand static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -\nlimiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world\ndriving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics.

Code:\n  https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT", "summary": "In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient\nexecution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile\nmodels-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical\ntasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and\nmedical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical\nimaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing\nlightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly\npurposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a\nparameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This\ndesign exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being\nlighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we\nintroduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively\nbalances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of\nmedical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer\nbottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with\ndownsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced\ncomputational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering\ndiverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen\ndatasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and\ngeneralization solution for mobile medical image analysis.

However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive\ninformation, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world\nwhere data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification\n(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting\nunauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its\ndiversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely\nchallenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied\non oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of\nsecurity. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model\nfirst learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet\nidentifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an\nout-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary.

Instead, agents\ncommunicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high\nscalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs\nduring inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,\nwe introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration\nand body rates.

HALO learns a reward model from offline data,\nleveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training,\nactions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using\npreference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the\npreferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive\nnavigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to\nalign with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,\nwe deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline\nlearned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a\nmodel-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward\nas an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both\nlearning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments\non a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained\nwith HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not\npresent in the training data.

Audiovisual data, as a\nrepresentative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order\nand diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is\nessential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal\ncorrelations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality\nindependently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal\ndependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural\nrelationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph\nnetwork (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a\nsegmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped\nsegments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph.

However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically\nrelies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain\nin practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and\nperforms poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather\nconditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse\nweather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model\narchitecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is\nachieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of\nclear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.\nSpecifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential\nMechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to\nachieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind\narbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed\nto shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence\nto prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded\nRegularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed\nregularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather\ngeneralization.

However, BC faces significant\nchallenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with\ndifferent camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades\ndespite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to\noverfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure,\nlimiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via\nAction Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral\nrepresentations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.\nCLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with\nsimilarity-weighted positive pairs.

While existing data-driven methods have\ndemonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich\ndomain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further\nadvancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for\ndownstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains\nunderexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain\nknowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge\nGraph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to\nconstruct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent\ndiverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding\nnetwork to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the\nOKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and\nthe complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned\nknowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM\nto model SST patterns for accurate prediction.

For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't\nabout the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent\ncomplementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic\nfeature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, \"Complementary Feature\nDomains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning,\" presents a mathematically\nquantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating\nthat optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic\ninformation-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e09\u79cd\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Hybrid 1\uff08\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u9891\u57df\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cHybrid 2\uff08\u989d\u5916\u52a0\u5165\u9891\u57df\uff09\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This inward focus results, in part, from the\ncomplexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile\nlaboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the\nVariable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and\nreveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In\nthis work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better\nrobot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular\nrobots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,\nadaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from\nsimple two-dimensional robot assemblies.

To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D\nobject affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance\ngrounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).\nPrevious attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to\ninconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In\naddition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas\ndepicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and\noperate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances\nsignificantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D\nrepresentation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the\ndependency between grounding and classification tasks.

In this work, we identify a subtler\nfailure mode that arises \\textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all\nagents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of\ntrajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint\ndata distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.\nThis \\textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces\ninaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In\nthis paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through\ncoordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of\npolicy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive\naction sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error.

In this paper,\nwe propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by\nlearning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer\ntask.

For language and vision models, the emergent ability\nto perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly\nuseful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.\nUnfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not\nnaturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the\nright finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible\nto inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining\nfor in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a\nsmall number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task.

However, as a compact and\nminimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many\nrepetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in\nambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D\nstructural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual\npre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual\nimages. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower\nFLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.\nIn particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering\nconstraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room\nimages. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of\nthe observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the\nscene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc\nalgorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite\nvisual FLoc.

One key challenge\nhere is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not\nexplicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,\na neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects\nfrom a few training examples and a structured natural-language task\nspecification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract\nspatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate\nrepresentation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)\npredicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the\ngrounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ninduce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.\nThis program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.\nFor (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture\nprimitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object\nposes based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning\nthree distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing\nitems on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom.

Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering.

The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria.

The adaptive\nlearning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well\nas in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter\nand the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of\nthe implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go\narbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with\nthe true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion\nplanning performance over time.

This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic\nrepresentations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a\nceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced\nframework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image\nclustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal\nSemantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.\nIn the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining\nconsistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster\nassignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to\nalign with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process\nis bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers\nand a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In\nthe second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The\nwell-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label\ngenerator.

Despite\nthe emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing\nsituation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse\nthan traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation\n(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a\npartial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach\nto obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation\nbranch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label\nPropagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP\nbranch.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training\ndata-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration\nchallenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems\ntailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose\nQuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for\nquadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of\nquadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,\nproviding a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively\ncapture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during\nquadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts\ncontrollable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and\nprovides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video\ngeneration under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller\n(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter\ncontrol through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in\nwide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream\narchitecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail\nenhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.\nWe further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training\ndata for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the\nperformance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we\nintroduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength\nbased on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with\nprompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving\nbenign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and\nT2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),\nwhile preserving high benign fidelity.

This influx of data presents opportunities\nfor cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts\nwhile also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope\nwith this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by\njointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their\noriginal data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability\ndifferences and educational context differences between different\ngroups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of\nmodels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware\nfederated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models\nbuilt upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,\npreserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students\non each client.

To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing\nmethods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring\ntechniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view\nstructure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle\nin handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we\ninstead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view\nSemantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations.

While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models\nfocus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market\nliquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we\nintroduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio\n(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a\nclearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing\nthe accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning\nmodels, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,\nusing historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and\nevaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the\nliquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with\nand without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed\nthe others.

However, in clinical settings without manual\nannotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models\nlacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we\npropose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring\nground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two\ncomplementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty\nmaps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and\npredicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark\nsegmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using\nMonte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify\nuncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,\nmutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D\nskin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation\nwith segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25\nand Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming\nprevious segmentation quality assessment methods.

At inference time, a decoding\nalgorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.\nExperiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method\nsurpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while\nexhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on\nunseen synthetic graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684ESPP\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8fb9\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "ESPP\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u6210\u672c\u73af\u65f6\u662fNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8fb9\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u8d1f\u6210\u672c\u73af\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u8fb9\u6982\u7387\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728100\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u62d3\u6251\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3ESPP\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise\narchitecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages\nKAN's adaptive capabilities.

However, existing adaptation methods are\ndesigned by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.\nInspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code\ngeneration, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation\n(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation\nalgorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as\nthe key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage\nLLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential\nmanner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search\nspace through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability\nand efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,\nweb based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective\nautomatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nalgorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous\nmanually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification\nsetting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in\nrecognition accuracy.

With the progress of\nvision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),\ntheir promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong\ngeneralizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in\nCLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.\nDuring backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without\nconsidering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks\nthat disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while\ntext-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited\nplasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP.

Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy\neffectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused\nby domain shifts.

The former, applied to each modality\nalone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone\nby self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different\nmodalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to\nfacilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed\npixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared\nparameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow\nbetween the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following\nmodality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused\ninformation flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates\nmodality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such\ndesigns, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking\nperformance with merely \\textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters.

However, in real clinical scenarios,\ndue to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face\nthe issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the\nfeatures of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with\nresampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or\nunderfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we\npropose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis\n(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that\ncombines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal\ncomplementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually\nadapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class\ndistribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model\nto progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.\nExtensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various\nmetrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data.

Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level\nprediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while\noverlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction\nstage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap\nand suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown\npromise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds\nupon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.\nThis inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and\ninterdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and\ndrastically increases training costs.

This creates a robust,\nautomated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an\nenvironment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU\nenergy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of\nunder 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay\nProduct (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework\ncan significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of\nexisting LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGFT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316GPU\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "method": "AGFT\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aAGFT\u8282\u770144.3%\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0cEDP\u4f18\u5316\u8fbe40.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "AGFT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically rely on strong\nprompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or\nimpractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they\noften perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape\nevolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,\nmost existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric\ninterpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are\ninferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end\nVElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit\ncontour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial\nlevel set function from image features and the point input, which then\nprogressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a\nshape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network.

However, their application to semantic segmentation is\nhindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as\nsegmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM\npre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation\nscenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task.

In this study, we developed a unique\nmulti-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian\ndairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,\nincluding instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity\nseamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by\ngeometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The\ndetection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow\ndataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an\nupgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for\ninstance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.\nEven with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman\nfilter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for\nobject tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT\nRealtime.

When approaching a work zone, large\ntrucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures\ncaused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of\nlarge truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated\nwith merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging\nbased on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into\na mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is\ncritical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a\nminimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process.

The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower\nconflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and\nTime Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.\nFurthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can\nperform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete\nstop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly\nobserved with the baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7LSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u5361\u8f66\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u51b2\u7a81\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u5361\u8f66\u56e0\u4f53\u79ef\u5927\u548c\u76f2\u533a\u591a\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5408\u5e76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u5e76\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u300150%\u548c85%\u5206\u4f4d\u95f4\u9694\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "LSTM\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eTET\u548cTIT\u503c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5361\u8f66\u52a8\u6001\u5408\u5e76\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u6b62\u3002", "conclusion": "LSTM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u5361\u8f66\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u5408\u5e76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on\nCIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior\nto downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training\npipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DBOM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e2d\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u53ca\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4e2d\u548c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "DBOM\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5e93\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u7f00\u8c03\u4f18\u89e3\u8026\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cGTSRB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDBOM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DBOM\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

We present a novel defence method against\ntargeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called\nLinear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as\nclustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious\nnodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a\nlinear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.\nThis method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear\ncombinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out\nredundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established\ndefence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks\nfrom both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments\nconfirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application\nsettings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated\nlearning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to\nbaseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for\nmalicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it\npreserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and\n0.5.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt.

To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified\nhierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive\nassessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by\ndual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation\nenvironments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,\nheterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast\nsystem) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into\nstandardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control\nabstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level\nactuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs\non physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

Services like\nClearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a\nlarge amount of online content associated with that person. This not only\nenables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as\nsocial media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their\nconsent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a\nuser-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such\nretrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial\nsignatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically\ndeformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of\nany facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing.

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

This paper proposes the\nFlexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for\nneural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance\ndegradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,\nwhich is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,\nFAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model\nperformance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures\ndifferences between unimportant units and those that cause performance\ndegradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to\nautomatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more\nefficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.\nAnother advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without\npost-pruning fine-tuning.

However, current RLVR methods\ntypically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO).

However, DNNs typically rely on large\ndatasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making\nthe training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have\nbeen proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and\ndataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating\nrepresentative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two\nsignificant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate\nthe quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive\nbias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training\nimages require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,\nleading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by\nthe nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a\nDNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the\ngeneralization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory\ncomputing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images\nneed to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR\nenergy consumption.

While recent solutions have\nshown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to\nmaintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare\nremoval. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages\nthe efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while\nmaintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we\ndesign a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations\nthrough varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space\nmodels that simultaneously preserves local details.

After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is\nderived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from\nparallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that\nare neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token\nsequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing\ncosts in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency\nand effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that\nFree-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\\times$ to 8$\\times$ longer input\nframes without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant\nresponses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing\ndedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef", "AI": {"tldr": "Free-MoRef\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Video-MLLMs\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u7c92\u5ea6\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFree-MoRef\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFree-MoRef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf92\u500d\u81f38\u500d\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u5e27\u7684\u5168\u9762\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891MLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "Free-MoRef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing\nnon-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,\nlayer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt\nto scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical\nbottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further\nlimits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning\npolicies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning\nFramework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design\ndependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports\nreal-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable\nto static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and\nreal-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can\nevaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative\noptimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies.

The\ncontent of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and\nconvolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve\nthe corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient\noptimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty\nparameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection\nmay result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a\nnovel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,\nwhich does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,\nand has faster convergence speed.

This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two\ndistinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and\ntheir associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a\nuser's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully\naddress both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data\nremoval or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work\nintroduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution\nto these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy\ntailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,\nit uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,\nwhich is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any\nremaining data traces among affected clients.

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to\nimprove their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a\ncontinual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model\nadaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden\nof existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme\nto store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory\nconsumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and\nfostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental\nresults on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based\nand CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized\nmodel adaptation.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the\nDecoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing\ngeometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting\nprocess. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming\nprior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both\nlatency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%.

Existing research shows that\npre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.\nHowever, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may\ninfluence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.\nIn particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely\nacknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been\nsystematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address\nthis gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed\nusing computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve\ncross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of\na foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across\nmultiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets\ntailored to specific medical modalities.

Although\naudio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired\naudio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion\npose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address\nthese issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs\nan interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into\nstructured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically\ngrounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive\nviseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the\nmodel to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed\nfrom enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention.

Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation.

Existing approaches typically\ninput the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,\nexpecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.\nHowever, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to\ngeneralize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to\nhighly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data.

Additionally, monocular depth\nestimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its\nsurroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy.

However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance\nsystems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we\ninvestigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a\npretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic\ncrosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed\nsurveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting\npedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial\nconditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing\nnormal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or\naltered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker.

Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is\ninfluenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,\nsuggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response\nto these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called\nPrecision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera\ncaptures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits\nthem to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for\nsafety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The\nsystem dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather\nand lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing\nbandwidth usage.

In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet\nstrong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data\ncuration for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to\nvarying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement\nLearning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.\nAcross extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six\nmedical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly\noutperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,\ncounter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning\ndata provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal\nimage-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on\ntext-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA\nbenchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,\nscaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary\nGPT-4o.
