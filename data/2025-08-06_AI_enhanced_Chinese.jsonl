However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions.

Due to the impracticality of large-scale\nreal-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most\nstudies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity\nraw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce\nrealistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV\nscenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale\nefficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic\nLiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from\nmicroscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives\n(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the\nspatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index).

Accepted to the ICCV 2025 Workshop on\n  Vision-based Industrial InspectiON (VISION)", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available.

We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic\nprofile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual\ncharacteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a\nuser-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task\nwith a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties\nfrom an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response\n(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our\nmodel enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material\nconfigurations defined dynamically at inference time.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications.

Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations.

BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE).

TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy.

The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.

Astronautical Congress (IAC-24), Milan, Italy,\n  Oct. 2024", "summary": "The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical\nchallenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the\nshape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,\nsuch as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,\nwhereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost\nof more demanding computational resources which might not be available on\nspace-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames.

Extensive experiments on the\nMVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in\nsegmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for\npixel-level anomaly synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "SARD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5224\u522b\u6027\u63a9\u6a21\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSARD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u6563\uff08RCD\uff09\u548c\u5224\u522b\u6027\u63a9\u6a21\u6307\u5bfc\uff08DMG\uff09\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u548cBTAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSARD\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "SARD\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u63a9\u6a21\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps.

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation.

Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a\nmulti-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action\nflows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate\naction estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes.

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct\nthe egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two\nperspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge\nOrthogonalization.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic\ndata, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches\nindividually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial\nprecision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented\nintermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more\nstable model adaptation to the target domain.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch.

Previous research\nhas identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision\nand natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering\nperformance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,\nit remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular\ndata tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world\napplications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular\ndata, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks\nusing five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier\nfindings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,\nwhere improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for\ntraditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the\nperception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of\nfairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that\napplies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged\ngroups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without\nnegatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study\nhighlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without\nzero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4ee5\u96f6\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u96f6\u548c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u62c9\u5e73\u6548\u5e94\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u907f\u514d\u96f6\u548c\u6743\u8861\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516b\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u572844\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1ML\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u96f6\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65e0\u96f6\u548c\u6743\u8861\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

Traditional numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting\nperformance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving\ncomplicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric\nphysics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial\nintelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous\nUnited States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical\nsatellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational\noverhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows\nSolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating\n24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer\nresolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the\nCONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly\nreduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%\nin reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively\ncaptures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the\nfirst-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy.

However, despite\ntheir practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with\ndifferent stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step\nregimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and\nanalyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely\nsensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative\nstrength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is\nintrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and\ncauses exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method\nis lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible\nwith standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image\n(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables\nup to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,\nrobustness, and semantic alignment.

However, it still faces the following\nchallenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and\ndiverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to\nunseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category\ninformation, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic\nsubspace.

Existing demoireing methods primarily\nrely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical\nchallenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real\ntextures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while\nremoving moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera\nframework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus\n(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one\ndefocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We\nuse the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,\nso as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise\ndemoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to\naddress any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and\ndefocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the\ndemoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional\ntraining loss.

In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space.

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation.

We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization.

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language\nmodel can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying\nthe topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its\nown questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity.

Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the\nsegment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image\nmeasures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a\nprompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for\nmeme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared\nvisual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that\nrequires more sophisticated matching techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8d8a\u6a21\u677f\u5339\u914d\u7684Meme\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u975e\u6a21\u677fMeme\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Meme\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6a21\u677fMeme\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5173\u8054\u7f51\u7edcMeme\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49Meme\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u677fMeme\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u6a21\u677fMeme\u9700\u5206\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "Meme\u5339\u914d\u9700\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u6a21\u677fMeme\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

First, we\nestablish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical\nsimulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to\nstrong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven\nneural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.\nMetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment\n(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and\nOptics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by\nlearning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)\ndistributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided\ndistillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also\nachieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcMetaScope\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMetaScope\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5149\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\uff08OIA\uff09\u548c\u8272\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff08OCC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "MetaScope\u5728\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaScope\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u900f\u955c\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to\nscale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In\nthis paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate\nnoise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the\nlimitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also\nintroduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100\nhigh-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,\neach lasting over one minute.

While recent\nadvances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action\nrecognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points\nto track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a\nnovel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational\ntokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling\nstrategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and\nsemantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that\ncaptures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented\nDisplacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action\npatterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with\nsemantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action\nrecognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),\nKinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.
