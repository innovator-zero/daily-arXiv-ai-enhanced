Despite its advantages,\ndeveloping VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to\nthe time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging\ninstructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs."}

These errors are\nparticularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are\nmeasured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods.

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for\nimages with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods\nqualitatively and quantitatively."}

Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a\ntrajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating\nstochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit\nassignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a\nnoise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to\nthe intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning\nduring high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later\nphases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization\nthat respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image\nbenchmarks."}

COR presents significant\nchallenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify\narbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically\nsimilar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct\nCOR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval\ntriplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also\npresent CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region\nencoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive\nlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms\nexisting models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and\neffective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for\nfine-grained multi-modal retrieval research."}

To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition.
