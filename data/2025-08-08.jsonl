To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot."}

We present optimal\nplanning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic\nmerging regulation (HCMR).

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms."}

To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details.

Accurate and robust segmentation\nmodels are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision\nmaking across diverse imaging modalities.

To address these\nissues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables\nmultimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method\nintegrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module\nthat harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local\ntraining. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset\nand a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was\ninitially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its\nperformance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT\ndata were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data\nscenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test\ncases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.\nIn the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized\nperformance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a\n10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong\ncross-modality generalization under privacy constraints."}

However, real-world applications face significant\nocclusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection\nfeatures from both the regression and classification branches of an object\ndetector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the\nfeature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative\nKalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,\nintegrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.\nBy combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed\nmethod offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded\nenvironments where occlusions are prevalent."}

In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that\nleverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize\nknowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on\nprogressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which\ncan be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger\ndataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively.

We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of\npedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to\ndistribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

At its core, GE-Base is\na large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the\nspatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in\na structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent\nrepresentations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,\nflow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference\nacross diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable\nevaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural\nsimulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.\nThe platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite\nmeasuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action\nalignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable\nand practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied\nintelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly."}
