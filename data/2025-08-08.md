### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual是一种基于Retinex理论的新型框架，用于超高清图像恢复任务，通过两个互补子网络（SAMBA和FIA）分别处理反射和光照问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频域转换）在超高清图像恢复中存在信息丢失或局部退化处理不足的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: RetinexDual结合了Scale-Attentive maMBA（SAMBA）和Frequency Illumination Adaptor（FIA），分别处理反射和光照问题，利用粗到细机制和频域全局上下文。

Result: 在去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光增强任务中，RetinexDual在质量和定量指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过双分支设计和组件协同，有效解决了超高清图像恢复中的关键问题，展示了其优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENTRep是ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge，专注于ENT内窥镜分析的细粒度分类与检索任务，支持双语临床监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共基准在ENT内窥镜分析中缺乏对分类和病例检索的支持，尤其是视觉和文本描述的检索。

Method: 引入ENTRep数据集，包含专家标注的图像和双语描述，定义三个基准任务并标准化提交协议。

Result: 报告了顶级团队的表现，并提供了深入讨论。

Conclusion: ENTRep填补了ENT内窥镜分析领域的空白，为临床实践提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级、无参数的框架，通过多教师蒸馏统一自监督视觉Transformer的知识，提升紧凑学生网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法通常独立预训练，忽略了互补性，导致模型过大，难以在资源受限环境中部署。

Method: CoMAD通过非对称掩码、线性适配器和联合共识门控，从多个教师模型中蒸馏知识，训练学生网络。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，CoMAD的ViT-Tiny达到75.4% Top-1准确率，密集预测任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: CoMAD在紧凑自监督蒸馏中确立了新的SOTA，展示了多教师蒸馏的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR提出了一种基于注意力扩散模型的无重建实时异常检测方法，解决了传统重建方法的计算成本高、重建不准确和噪声选择困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散模型的异常检测方法存在计算成本高、重建不准确和噪声选择困难的问题，RADAR旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: RADAR直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，避免了重建过程，提高了检测精度和计算效率。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR在准确性、精确度、召回率和F1分数上均优于现有方法，F1分数分别提高了7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种高效且准确的异常检测方法，适用于实时应用，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用事件相机和深度学习技术开发低成本、高精度的眼动追踪算法，CNN_LSTM模型达到81%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高速眼动追踪的高成本问题，提升VR/AR设备的用户体验。

Method: 采用CNN_LSTM模型处理事件相机的输入数据，预测眼中心位置。

Result: 模型准确率约为81%。

Conclusion: 未来工作将聚焦于LRP技术，进一步提升模型可解释性和性能。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN模型结合Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks和Lucas多项式激活函数，通过小波变换和空间投影层实现高效且准确的3D人体运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: 使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕捉关节依赖关系，KAN层结合Lucas多项式进行高效函数逼近。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: LuKAN在精度和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在细粒度视觉线索识别和复杂推理能力的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估MLLMs的视觉能力时存在不足，无法充分测试模型对细微视觉线索的识别和复杂推理能力。

Method: VER-Bench包含374个精心设计的问题，涵盖多种推理类型，每个问题附带结构化证据（视觉线索和相关推理）。

Result: VER-Bench揭示了当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM框架通过多模态查询和双流注意力机制，提升了遮挡和细粒度定位问题下的检测精度与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based检测器在遮挡、细粒度定位和计算效率方面存在不足。

Method: 引入三种查询（外观、位置、随机学习查询）和双流交叉注意力模块，分别优化语义和空间特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，AP和召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了视频级标注中的标签噪声对仇恨视频检测的影响，通过精细标注和时间戳分析揭示了语义重叠和模型决策边界的改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线多媒体内容的快速增长加剧了仇恨言论的传播，现有方法依赖粗糙的视频级标注，忽略了仇恨内容的时间粒度，导致标签噪声。

Method: 使用HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集，通过时间戳修剪仇恨视频片段，分析仇恨与非仇恨内容的分布和特征。

Result: 实验表明时间戳噪声改变模型决策边界并降低分类置信度，凸显仇恨言论的上下文依赖性和时间连续性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间感知模型和基准的必要性，以提高仇恨视频检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA是一种测试时自适应框架，通过动态调整模型以适应每个测试视频的特性，提升视频高光检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频高光检测方法通用性不足，无法适应不同测试视频的独特特性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，结合主任务和辅助任务（跨模态幻觉）进行联合优化，并在测试时通过辅助任务动态调整模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和三种先进模型上的实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了高光检测性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过测试时自适应有效解决了通用性问题，提升了高光检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于透视图像训练的单目深度估计器（FMDEs）扩展到鱼眼图像，通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs在鱼眼图像上因相机参数变化导致深度估计错误，需解决分布偏移问题。

Method: 引入校准令牌作为轻量适配机制，调整潜在嵌入以对齐分布，利用自监督学习。

Result: 在室内外场景中，使用单一令牌集显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效扩展FMDEs至鱼眼图像，无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索新方法在ImageNet数据集上的性能表现，并分析未达到100%准确率的原因。

Method: 使用[5]中的新方法训练前馈神经网络。

Result: 模型在ImageNet 2012数据集上达到98.3%的准确率和99.69%的Top-1率，平均每批次完美分类285.9个标签。

Conclusion: 模型性能优异，但未达到100%准确率的原因可能是数据集中的双标签问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM通过整合掩码图像建模（MIM）到现有VLM流程中，提升条件提示学习的泛化能力，减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法（如CoOp和CoCoOp）在适应新任务时容易过拟合已知类别，泛化能力不足。

Method: ProMIM采用掩码策略生成实例条件提示，增强特征鲁棒性，且不改变原有架构。

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM在零样本和小样本分类任务中显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉-语言应用提供了一种轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TRKT的方法，通过关系感知知识挖掘和双流融合模块，解决了弱监督动态场景图生成中外部检测器的问题，并在Action Genome数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督动态场景图生成方法依赖外部物体检测器，但在动态、关系感知场景中表现不佳，导致定位不准确和低置信度提案。

Method: TRKT包含两部分：1) 关系感知知识挖掘，通过类别特定注意力图和帧间注意力增强策略挖掘关系与运动感知知识；2) 双流融合模块，将注意力图与外部检测结合以优化定位和置信度。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，TRKT实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT通过知识增强和融合策略，有效提升了弱监督动态场景图生成的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自监督学习方法对领域偏移的鲁棒性不确定，尤其在生物医学影像中，批次效应可能掩盖真实生物信号。

Method: AdvDINO在DINOv2架构中引入梯度反转层，学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在非小细胞肺癌的多重免疫荧光图像中，AdvDINO减少了幻灯片特异性偏差，发现了具有预后意义的表型簇，并提升了生存预测。

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学影像，还可推广到其他领域，如放射学、遥感和自动驾驶。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Method: 构建查询数据的类原型，利用稀疏标注指导分割，引入层次化原型消歧机制和密集CRF优化标签分配。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过人机交互动态优化，显著提升了开世界点云语义分割的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法中高斯权重均等，易导致过拟合，尤其在稀疏视图场景下。

Method: 提出基于学习不确定性的自适应高斯加权，结合软可微丢弃正则化。

Result: 在稀疏视图3D合成中表现优异，PSNR提升3.27%（MipNeRF 360数据集）。

Conclusion: 自适应加权和不确定性学习显著提升3DGS在稀疏视图下的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano上运行YOLOv11，结果显示更高的mAP和召回率。

Conclusion: 扩展的自由度改善了质量/成本权衡，提升了性能。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Motivation: 传统扩散图像压缩存在解码延迟高和保真度差的缺点，SODEC旨在通过单步解码和保真度引导模块解决这些问题。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE模型生成信息丰富的潜在表示，并用单步解码替代迭代去噪过程，同时引入保真度引导模块和速率退火训练策略。

Result: SODEC在率失真感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，实现了高效且高质量的图像压缩。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Result: 在16个数据集上评估，模型在分布外场景中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，无需依赖大规模训练。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Result: 在多种实验设置下，性能提升高达9%，计算效率提升9倍。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了模态差距问题，显著提升了跨域适应性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Motivation: 探索早期视觉皮层如何快速学习全局图像上下文，并模拟大脑中的快速学习机制。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer (ViT)自编码器，结合Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)实现快速权重。

Result: 发现熟悉性训练能增强早期层对全局上下文的敏感性，并扩展自注意力范围。

Conclusion: 快速权重架构为研究大脑中的快速全局上下文学习提供了可行计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优性能，显著提升遮挡和细微差异处理能力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID有效解决了遮挡和细微差异问题，同时保持标准场景的竞争力。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

Method: 采用压缩视觉技术，存储视频编码而非原始数据，并通过在线训练视频压缩器。提出刷新视频编码的方案，避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模数据集上，CRAM方法在内存占用显著减少的情况下，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CRAM通过压缩和刷新视频编码，有效解决了视频持续学习中的内存和遗忘问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Conclusion: MCDRL通过因果驱动方法有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Conclusion: skin-SOAP能有效减轻临床负担，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

Result: SCSSIM对非构图失真具有高度不变性，并能准确反映构图失真的变化。

Conclusion: SCSSIM在结构评估方面优于现有方法，是开发生成模型的有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Result: 在MEVID等基准测试中，性能显著提升（如Rank-1准确率提升13.0%）。

Conclusion: HAMoBE通过模仿人类感知机制和动态调整专家贡献，有效提升了视频行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Result: 实验表明Spot-IT在复杂布局中提取精确细节时显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了多模态大语言模型在细粒度文档理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

TL;DR: DualMat是一种双路径扩散框架，用于在复杂光照条件下从单张图像估计基于物理的渲染（PBR）材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在估计PBR材料时难以同时处理复杂光照和高分辨率输入，DualMat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过两个潜在空间（RGB和材料专用）进行双路径估计，结合特征蒸馏和整流流技术提升效率和一致性。

Result: 在Objaverse和真实数据上表现优异，比现有方法在反照率估计和金属粗糙度预测上分别提升28%和39%。

Conclusion: DualMat在PBR材料估计中实现了最先进的性能，并适用于高分辨率和多视图输入。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS提出了一种两阶段框架，通过解耦类别感知检测和类别无关分割，解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSS方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习干扰和次优的保留-可塑性平衡。

Method: DecoupleCSS分为两阶段：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器生成位置感知提示；第二阶段利用SAM模型生成精确分割掩码。

Result: 该方法在多种挑战性任务中实现了最先进的性能，平衡了保留和适应性。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦设计有效提升了持续语义分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像着色任务具有高度不适定性，传统回归方法忽略了颜色预测的多模态特性，因此需要更先进的方法。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但强调了方法的改进和比较。

Conclusion: 通过分类和对抗学习可以更有效地解决图像着色问题，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN和扩散模型方法依赖额外组件或损失函数，可能引入误差，导致迁移效果不佳。FLUX-Makeup旨在消除这些限制。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，使用源图像作为条件输入，并引入轻量级RefLoRAInjector解耦参考路径，同时设计了高效的数据生成流程。

Result: 实验表明，FLUX-Makeup在多样场景中表现出色，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup通过简化框架和高效数据生成，实现了高保真和身份一致的化妆迁移，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs在自监督预训练中表现出色，但其预训练背景多样且不透明，导致潜在偏差，影响下游应用的泛化性和透明度。

Method: AdaFusion通过压缩和对齐来自不同模型的瓦片级特征，并利用轻量级注意力机制根据组织表型上下文自适应融合这些特征。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够桥接异构PFMs，实现性能提升和模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和视频长度限制的问题，需要一种能够精确控制主题身份和运动的方法。

Method: 采用in-context LoRA微调策略，在token级别注入主题外观以保持身份，同时在通道级别条件化姿态信息以控制运动。通过交错片段生成方法和共享KV缓存机制实现长视频的无缝拼接。

Result: 在仅33小时视频数据集上训练，PoseGen在身份保真度、姿态准确性和生成无限长度视频方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen通过创新的微调和生成策略，实现了长视频的高质量生成，解决了身份漂移和长度限制的核心挑战。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty）是一种新型的Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning（FSCIL）方法，通过在不同阶段策略性地整合边缘惩罚，解决了基类与新类之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本高，导致增量学习中训练数据不足，性能下降。现有方法难以平衡基类区分性和新类泛化性。

Method: 提出SMP方法，包括基任务学习的MIAM机制（训练两组低秩适配器）和增量任务的MPCC策略（通过边缘惩罚校准分类器）。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中达到最优性能，平衡了基类和新类。

Conclusion: SMP通过边缘惩罚策略有效提升了FSCIL的性能和平衡性。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习在病理图像分类中因处理大量图像块导致的高推理成本问题。

Method: 采用动态多实例网络和双分支轻量级实例预筛选网络，结合自蒸馏和非对称蒸馏训练。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，AHDMIL在分类性能和推理速度上均优于现有方法，如Camelyon16数据集准确率提升5.3%，推理速度加快1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL通过高效筛选和分类机制，显著提升了病理图像分类的性能和效率。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有RIS和REC方法，并在GRES基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过多潜在表达和互补视觉细节的结合，显著提升了视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Result: 在有限数据场景下，FedGIN比无GIN的FL方法提升12-18%的3D Dice分数；在完整数据场景下，性能接近集中式训练，跨模态泛化能力显著。

Conclusion: FedGIN在多模态医学图像分割中表现出色，尤其在隐私保护和数据稀缺条件下，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Conclusion: 提出的方法首次实现了端到端的旋转等变性，显著提升了图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: X-MoGen通过统一框架和形态一致性模块，成功解决了跨物种运动生成的挑战。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Method: PhysPatch联合优化补丁位置、形状和内容，引入语义掩码初始化、SVD局部对齐损失和势场掩码细化。

Result: PhysPatch在多种MLLM上显著优于现有方法，并在实际场景中实现可行部署。

Conclusion: PhysPatch为MLLM对抗攻击提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轨迹片段增强的多目标跟踪方法（MTT），通过短时空关联生成鲁棒轨迹片段，并利用多线索进行长期关联，解决了未见类别目标跟踪的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，未见类别的目标常因低置信度检测、弱运动与外观约束及长期遮挡等问题，挑战现有跟踪方法。

Method: MTT方法将灵活的轨迹片段生成与多轨迹片段关联框架结合，先自适应聚类检测结果生成鲁棒轨迹片段，再通过位置和外观等多线索估计最佳轨迹片段分区。

Result: 在通用多目标跟踪基准测试中，MTT表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: MTT框架有效解决了未见类别目标的跟踪问题，提升了长期关联的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Result: 在基准数据集上，SPA++显著优于现有方法，表现出更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SPA++通过谱对齐和一致性正则化，有效解决了域适应中的判别性与可转移性权衡问题。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Method: 构建SPIE数据集，将光谱先验编码为文本属性，并设计多尺度特征聚合、令牌上下文压缩和多光谱视觉预训练等策略。

Result: 在五个公共多光谱数据集上，SPEX在提取典型土地覆盖类别（如植被、建筑物和水体）时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPEX不仅性能优越，还能生成预测的文本解释，增强了可解释性和用户友好性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher通过大规模多域数据预训练，提出了一种通用的内窥镜图像匹配方法，解决了视觉条件困难和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像中的密集特征匹配对机器人辅助任务至关重要，但视觉条件困难和标注数据稀缺是主要挑战。

Method: 采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强对应学习；构建Endo-Mix6多域数据集，采用渐进多目标训练策略。

Result: 在零样本实验中，EndoMatcher在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上分别提高了140.69%和201.43%的内点匹配数，并在Gastro-Matching数据集上提高了9.40%的MDPA。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在挑战性内窥镜条件下实现了密集且准确的匹配，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法简单且性能下降明显，需要更高效的剪枝策略。

Method: 提出重要性映射和渐进式剪枝模块，结合视觉信息流优化剪枝策略。

Result: 剪枝90%视觉令牌，减少89% KV-Cache内存，推理速度提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt在高效剪枝的同时保持性能，适用于多种LMMs。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中因域差异导致的性能下降问题，同时避免数据隐私和传输成本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了跨域少样本分割性能，且无需源域数据支持。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了推理生成策略的有效性，并发布了新数据集TNLLT。

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack框架显著提升了视觉语言跟踪的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Result: 模型能准确分割高度非凸、不规则的气泡结构。

Conclusion: 现代视觉基础模型在复杂气泡分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen是一种基于扩散模型的框架，用于从任意视角生成可控相机图像，无需额外传感器或深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中任意视角图像生成缺乏真实数据，导致高保真生成模型训练困难。

Method: 引入FAVS和CVC-SSL：FAVS通过分层匹配策略实现几何对应，CVC-SSL通过自监督学习强制跨视角一致性。

Result: 框架仅需多相机图像及其位姿即可训练，支持多种车辆配置的任意视角生成。

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen首次实现了多车辆配置下的可控任意视角相机图像生成。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies

trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding

latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial

Conclusion: 区域感知对比预训练对医学图像理解至关重要，RegionMed-CLIP为多模态医学图像分析提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Result: 仅需Feature-3DGS 5%的高斯数量即可构建具有竞争力的3D特征场。

Conclusion: CF3方法在保持几何细节的同时，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following

TL;DR: SGDFuse利用SAM生成的语义掩码作为显式先验，通过条件扩散模型实现高保真和语义感知的红外与可见光图像融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏对场景的深层语义理解，导致关键目标丢失，且融合过程可能引入伪影和细节损失。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：先初步融合多模态特征，再结合SAM的语义掩码驱动扩散模型进行粗到细的去噪生成。

Result: SGDFuse在主观和客观评估中均达到最先进性能，且对下游任务适应性强。

Conclusion: SGDFuse为图像融合的核心挑战提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Motivation: 4D LiDAR在动态户外环境中有潜力，但缺乏高质量标注和适合的MLLM架构。

Method: 提出B4DL基准测试、数据生成管道和直接处理4D LiDAR的MLLM模型。

Result: 提供了统一的时空推理解决方案，包括渲染的4D LiDAR视频和数据集。

Conclusion: B4DL填补了4D LiDAR在MLLM中的空白，为动态环境理解提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），用于增强遥感图像中的边缘细节和全局结构建模，显著提高了变化检测的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以捕捉细微变化区域。频率域（尤其是小波域）特征建模可以放大频率分量的细粒度差异，增强边缘变化的感知。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频分量，分别建模局部细节和全局结构。高频分支设计了双频特征增强模块（DFFE）和频域交互差异模块（FDID）；低频分支利用Transformer捕获全局语义关系，并通过渐进上下文差异模块（PCDM）精化变化区域。最后融合高低频特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF显著减轻了边缘模糊问题，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过小波域的双频编码和特征融合，有效统一了局部敏感性和全局判别能力，为遥感图像变化检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPAT草图分析依赖心理学家经验且耗时，需要自动化工具支持大规模评估。

Method: 结合视觉和语义信息，利用LLM进行抑郁评估，提供自动化分析环境。

Result: 实验结果显示，VS-LLM方法比心理学家评估方法提升了17.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于PPAT草图元素识别的心理状态评估研究提供了新思路，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: CoCAViT通过创新的注意力机制和架构设计，显著提升了小型模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，同时保持了高效的计算性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG通过引入结构化多模态知识，有效提升了知识密集型VQA任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型预训练视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现出色，但微调通常会丧失其自然语言查询和零样本能力。

Method: 通过文本反转学习新的或改进现有的标记，仅需少量示例即可检测新对象，同时保持原始模型权重冻结。

Result: 该方法在多种实验中表现优于基线方法，且计算成本显著低于全模型微调。

Conclusion: 文本反转方法有效扩展了VLM的词汇表，同时保留了其原始能力，适用于开放词汇目标检测。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS使用高斯函数作为基元，其低通特性限制了高频细节的表示，且导致冗余基元和效率问题。

Method: 提出3D Gabor基元，结合多方向3D频率响应，开发CUDA光栅化器和频率自适应机制。

Result: 实验显示3DGabSplat在渲染质量和效率上优于3DGS，PSNR提升1.35 dB，同时减少基元数量和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat是一种高效且高质量的3D渲染方法，可无缝集成到现有3DGS框架中。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法多基于单张图像生成报告，忽略了临床背景和先验图像，无法捕捉诊断意图或疾病进展。PriorRG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 先验引导的对比预训练，利用临床背景指导时空特征提取；2. 先验感知的粗到细解码，逐步整合先验知识与视觉编码器隐藏状态。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和MIMIC-ABN数据集上，PriorRG表现优于现有方法，BLEU-4和F1分数分别提升3.6%和3.8%，BLEU-1提升5.9%。

Conclusion: PriorRG通过模拟临床工作流和整合先验知识，显著提升了胸部X光报告的临床准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有跨视图定位方法仅输出单一相机位姿，缺乏冗余观测，难以评估定位可靠性。

Method: Slice-Loc将查询图像切片，估计每个切片的3自由度位姿，通过几何刚性公式过滤错误位姿，并利用NFA模型量化定位可靠性。

Result: 在DReSS数据集上，Slice-Loc将平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过冗余观测和错误过滤，显著提升了跨视图定位的精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过结合解剖知识和深度学习，显著提升了CT报告生成的性能。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 可变形注意力能有效捕捉WSIs和ROIs中的复杂空间结构。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

Motivation: 解决现有Masked Generative Transformers在组合性文本到图像生成中属性绑定和文本-图像对齐的不足。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，利用注意力图指导解掩码过程，优先处理明确表示对象的标记。

Result: 在多个基准和指标上，UNCAGE在定量和定性评估中均表现提升，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: UNCAGE有效提升了组合性文本到图像生成的保真度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制在检测和修正投毒图像时面临挑战，可能影响数据效用和系统可靠性。

Method: 利用多数投票机制和多个先进视觉语言模型检测投毒图像，并通过校准噪声修正。

Result: 实验表明，TrueBiometric能100%准确检测并修正投毒图像，且不影响干净图像的准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric提供了一种更实用、准确和有效的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度优化的对抗性伪装框架，通过梯度校准和去相关方法，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理对抗伪装在安全关键领域（如自动驾驶）中构成重大威胁，现有方法在多变物理环境中效果不佳。

Method: 引入梯度校准策略和梯度去相关方法，优化多角度和距离下的梯度更新。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在攻击成功率上平均提高了13.46%（距离）和11.03%（角度）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有技术，并突显了更鲁棒系统设计的必要性。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothSA改进Slot Attention，通过预热查询和差异化处理视频帧，提升对象中心学习的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Slot Attention在图像或视频首帧冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息，以及非首帧查询处理同质化的问题。

Method: 1. 预热冷启动查询；2. 差异化处理视频帧（首帧用完整迭代，非首帧用单次迭代）。

Result: 在对象发现、识别和下游任务中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过平滑迭代和递归优化了Slot Attention的性能。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一阶显著性图无法捕捉跨模态交互的复杂性，需要更高效且灵活的解释方法。

Method: 利用加权Banzhaf交互指数，提出FIxLIP方法，并扩展了评估指标到二阶交互解释。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP表现优于一阶方法，并能有效比较不同模型。

Conclusion: FIxLIP不仅提供高质量解释，还能用于模型比较，展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Flow Matching（FM）的无监督异常检测和定位新范式，通过时间反转FM（rFM）和Worst Transport（WT）插值路径解决传统方法的局限性，并在MVTec数据集上实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于流的方法在模型表达能力上存在局限性，需要一种更高效的无监督异常检测方法。

Method: 提出时间反转FM（rFM）和Worst Transport（WT）插值路径，增强对样本轨迹的动态控制。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了最优性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持，并展示了其在大规模复杂数据上的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Motivation: 垂体肿瘤手术中解剖结构分割可预警风险区域，但缺乏标注数据集。

Method: 构建PAS数据集，采用数据增强和特征融合模块F2PASeg。

Result: F2PASeg能实时稳定分割关键结构。

Conclusion: F2PASeg为垂体手术规划提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Motivation: 填补对抗攻击评估的空白，探究压缩模型对攻击的抵抗能力。

Method: 构建白盒和自适应攻击，评估多种压缩模型的抗攻击能力。

Result: 高真实感重建的压缩模型抗攻击能力更强，低真实感模型易被攻破。

Conclusion: 高真实感重建提供固有鲁棒性，未来攻击需克服真实感挑战。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图缺乏一致性，预训练基础模型难以处理其多样化的形状和风格。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND定义的类别，并通过少样本微调适应新类别。

Conclusion: OND知识提示有效提升历史地图分割性能，SMOL-MapSeg表现优越。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言中效果不佳，缺乏多模态信息和文化基础，无法满足用户需求。

Result: 在MELLA上微调后，八种语言的MLLM性能普遍提升，生成更丰富的描述。

Conclusion: MELLA通过增强文化知识和语言能力，有效提升了低资源语言MLLM的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

Conclusion: AutoIAD通过迭代优化和领域知识库，提供了高效、高质量的工业异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Motivation: 当前形状描述符缺乏手性信息，无法区分左右对称部分，而手性信息在形状分析中普遍存在。

Result: 在左右解缠、形状匹配和部分分割等任务中验证了特征的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的手性特征提取方法具有实用价值，能显著提升形状分析任务的表现。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法依赖物体模板或假设完全可见，实际场景中因视角固定和遮挡导致重建不准确。

Method: 结合新颖视图合成扩散模型和可见接触约束，优化重建过程。

Result: MagicHOI显著优于现有方法，扩散先验有效正则化未观测区域。

Conclusion: 扩散模型先验能有效提升手-物体重建质量，尤其在视角受限场景。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动建模，该方法显著提升了遮挡场景下的行人跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Motivation: 现有方法在输入空间注入高斯噪声会降低图像质量，而特征空间噪声注入能保持图像保真度并提供鲁棒性保证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未认证时减少99.5%推理时间，认证时减少20.6%，且主观质量评分相关性提升达30.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像质量的同时显著提升计算效率和鲁棒性，适用于多种IQA场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad

fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构剪枝方法忽视参数间的相互联系，导致性能下降。

Method: 引入Jacobian Criterion评估参数重要性，提出Equivalent Pruning机制通过自编码器保留原始连接的影响。

Result: Jacobian Criterion在保持模型性能上优于现有方法，Equivalent Pruning有效减少微调后的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架通过考虑参数间联系和保留剪枝连接的影响，显著提升了结构剪枝的效果。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

TL;DR: SSTGNN是一种轻量级的空间-频谱-时序图神经网络框架，用于检测AI生成和篡改视频，性能优越且参数少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法因依赖孤立的空间、时序或频谱信息而难以泛化到多种篡改类型，且通常需要大模型。

Method: SSTGNN将视频表示为结构化图，结合可学习频谱滤波器和时序差分建模，捕捉篡改痕迹。

Result: 在多样基准数据集上，SSTGNN在域内和跨域设置中表现优越，且对未见篡改具有强鲁棒性，参数减少42.4倍。

Conclusion: SSTGNN是一种高效、轻量且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线视频内容的爆炸式增长，人工审核不安全视频的需求已超出人类能力，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过引入专业标注的多模态多语言数据集，对比分析了Gemini、GPT和Llama等MLLMs在品牌安全分类中的表现。

Result: MLLMs在品牌安全分类中表现出色，但仍有局限性，论文详细讨论了其失败案例。

Conclusion: MLLMs在内容审核领域具有潜力，但需进一步研究以提升其准确性和成本效益。

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Action Discovery的新方法，用于解决部分标注数据集中模糊动作和未标注动作的识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经科学等领域，部分动作（已知动作）有标注，而其他动作（未知动作）未标注，导致数据集不完整。

Method: 采用两步法：1) GGSM模块模仿已知动作的粒度识别时间区间；2) UASA模块基于嵌入相似性为未知动作分配语义类别。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly数据集上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Action Discovery有效解决了部分标注数据集中的动作识别问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）对高质量、多样化和可扩展数据的需求日益增长，但大规模真实数据收集成本高且耗时，限制了应用发展。

Method: 通过MLLM-Collector收集多模态输入资产及其描述，利用MLLM-Generator和MLLM-Optimizer构建3D布局并进行语义优化，最后用MLLM-Planner生成时间连贯的未来帧。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction作为一种可扩展且高效的数据引擎，具有推动生成智能发展的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART框架通过自适应模块增强VLP模型，结合LLM知识提升开放词汇多标签识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖关系建模上的不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含ARM和ATM模块，分别优化类内定位和类间关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DART有效整合LLM知识，提升开放词汇多标签识别能力。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: WeTok tokenizer通过分组无查找量化和生成解码技术，在视觉生成任务中实现了更高的压缩比和重建保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间存在不足，WeTok旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）技术，分别解决内存计算限制和视觉细节重建问题。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok实现了最低的零样本rFID（0.12），并在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中显著优于现有方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Motivation: 评估图像-文本相关性是衡量生成AI响应质量的关键，但现有方法难以处理多样化的文本格式和场景定义。

Method: 采用LLaVA架构，结合任务指令和多模态上下文样本，构建二元相关性数据集。

Result: 实验验证了LLaVA-RE框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为二元图像-文本相关性评估提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链方法在视觉语言推理任务中表现不佳，主要由于视觉状态转换建模能力有限或架构碎片化导致的视觉轨迹不连贯。

Method: Uni-CoT采用两级推理范式：宏观级用于任务规划，微观级用于子任务执行，并结合交错图像-文本监督和多任务目标进行训练。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS等基准测试中，Uni-CoT表现出SOTA性能和强泛化能力，且仅需8块A100 GPU即可高效完成实验。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一个高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Motivation: 现有3D内容质量评估方法主要依赖图像指标且仅关注对象级，难以捕捉空间一致性、材料真实性和局部细节。

Method: 提出Hi3DEval框架，结合对象级和部分级评估，扩展材料真实性评估；构建Hi3DBench数据集和多代理标注流程；提出基于混合3D表示的自动评分系统。

Result: 实验表明，Hi3DEval在建模3D特性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于现有图像指标。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval为3D生成内容提供了可扩展的评估方法，替代人工评估。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 测试时缩放和强化学习在GUI定位中潜力巨大，为高效鲁棒的GUI代理提供新路径。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要针对显著、孤立对象，限制了真实场景的泛化能力，MOSEv2旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含5,024个视频、701,976个高质量掩码的数据集，涵盖200类10,074个对象，引入复杂场景和多样化挑战。

Result: 20种VOS方法和9种跟踪方法在MOSEv2上性能显著下降，显示当前方法在真实场景中的局限性。

Conclusion: MOSEv2为真实场景下的VOS研究提供了新基准，凸显现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

Result: GAP在不同复杂度的点云上（合成、真实扫描、大规模场景）均表现出色。

Conclusion: GAP成功实现了从点云到高斯的转换，具有高保真和几何准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer是一种可取消的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸和合成代码的潜在空间来保护隐私，同时保持识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸匿名化方法无法满足生物特征模板保护的需求（如可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性），因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，并通过多目标损失函数优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FaceAnonyMixer在商业API上实现了超过11%的识别准确率提升，同时提供更强的隐私保护。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer能够生成高质量的可取消人脸图像，无需修改现有的人脸识别系统即可直接匹配，平衡了隐私保护和识别准确性。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable

### [102] [NAEx: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Explaining Network Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04731)
*Shruti Saxena,Arijit Khan,Joydeep Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAEx是一个即插即用的模型无关框架，用于解释网络对齐模型的决策，通过识别关键子图和特征来增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络对齐模型的可解释性有限，难以理解对齐决策，影响在高风险领域的信任建立。

Method: NAEx通过可学习的边和特征掩码联合参数化图结构和特征空间，并引入优化目标确保解释忠实于原始预测且能比较网络间的结构和特征相似性。

Result: NAEx在基准数据集上展示了高效性和有效性，并与四种代表性网络对齐模型集成。

Conclusion: NAEx为网络对齐模型提供了可解释性，解决了跨网络依赖性问题，适用于未见数据。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

TL;DR: LumiGen是一个基于LVLM的迭代框架，通过智能提示解析和视觉反馈优化，显著提升了T2I模型在细粒度控制和语义一致性上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型在处理复杂指令、细粒度控制和语义一致性方面存在不足，而LVLM在跨模态理解和指令跟随方面表现出色。

Method: LumiGen包含智能提示解析与增强模块（IPPA）和迭代视觉反馈与优化模块（IVFR），通过闭环反馈机制优化图像生成。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I基准测试中，LumiGen以3.08的平均分数优于现有方法，尤其在文本渲染和姿态表达方面表现突出。

Conclusion: LVLM的集成显著提升了T2I模型的可控性和生成质量，验证了LumiGen框架的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于集群感知的分层联邦聚合框架，用于解决边缘设备上扩散模型的计算和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在边缘设备上计算资源受限，且云解决方案存在隐私和效率问题。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）进行本地微调，通过集群化和分层联邦聚合实现个性化内容生成。

Result: 框架在加速收敛的同时，保持了多用户个性化AIGC服务的可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘约束下的高效、个性化内容生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大型多模态模型（LMMM）的少样本学习（FSL）方法，通过多模态数据集M3FD和框架M3F，显著提升了FSL模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学、环境科学等领域，样本稀缺且数据收集成本高，传统FSL方法效果有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 构建了多模态数据集M3FD，并开发了M3F框架，通过预训练和微调LMMM来提升FSL性能。

Result: M3F在多种任务类型中优于传统元学习方法，为数据稀缺领域提供了可行的FSL解决方案。

Conclusion: M3FD和M3F为科学领域中的FSL应用提供了统一且可扩展的工具，降低了LMMM的使用门槛。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol通过属性引导的强化学习框架提升分子属性预测性能，优于传统方法和先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在分子属性预测中依赖人工提示和冗长推理的问题。

Method: 采用属性引导的强化学习框架，结合格式、计数和合理性奖励。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于监督微调模型和先进模型。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol能有效提取相关分子属性，提升预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

TL;DR: PA-RNet是一种针对多模态时间序列预测的鲁棒框架，通过扰动感知模块和跨模态注意力机制有效处理文本噪声，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态时间序列数据（尤其是文本模态）常受干扰，现有方法忽视文本数据的固有扰动，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PA-RNet，包含扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，分离噪声并保留语义信息。

Result: 理论证明PA-RNet的Lipschitz连续性，实验显示其在多领域和时间设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet通过系统处理文本噪声，显著提升多模态时间序列预测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ是一种无需训练的混合精度量化框架，通过测量层间信息流变化来优化位宽分配，显著提升搜索效率和模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算昂贵的搜索算法或局部敏感度代理（如Hessian），无法捕捉量化误差的全局影响。

Method: 通过单次前向传播量化各层并测量后续层互信息变化，将位宽分配建模为整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在ImageNet上，MobileNetV2和ResNet18的精度提升1%，压缩率分别达14X和10.66X。

Conclusion: InfoQ在搜索效率和模型性能上优于现有方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL-based DTRs在临床决策中的工程复杂性和安全性问题，探索LLMs的潜力。

Method: 在模拟1型糖尿病环境中，比较开源LLMs与小型RL代理的零样本推理性能。

Result: LLMs在稳定患者中表现优异，但存在算术幻觉等问题。

Conclusion: 建议结合LLMs与结构化生理模型，通过提示工程和验证实现安全决策支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

TL;DR: EPOPR框架通过结合不确定性感知的维修时长预测和强化学习，提出了一种公平且高效的电力恢复策略，显著减少了停电时间和社区间的不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电力恢复决策基于请求量，导致弱势社区因请求较少而面临更长的停电时间，存在不公平问题。

Method: 设计了EPOPR框架，包括Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression和Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL，以平衡效率和公平。

Result: 实验显示，EPOPR平均减少停电时间3.60%，降低社区间不公平14.19%。

Conclusion: EPOPR有效解决了电力恢复中的效率和公平问题，为未来类似系统提供了参考。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐方法难以处理非静态数据流，而持续学习方法通常需要集中数据访问，无法满足联邦学习的隐私约束。

Method: F3CRec框架包含客户端自适应重放记忆和服务器端项目时间均值，平衡知识保留与适应。

Result: 实验表明F3CRec在联邦环境中长期保持推荐质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F3CRec成功整合联邦学习与持续学习，为动态数据下的隐私保护推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

Motivation: 现有网约车系统多关注效率而忽视乘客和司机体验，HCRide旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: 采用Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic)算法，包含多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络。

Result: 在深圳和纽约的真实数据中，HCRide将系统效率、公平性和司机偏好分别提升2.02%、5.39%和10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide成功实现了效率与用户体验的平衡，验证了人本设计在网约车系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: 在六个真实世界基准测试中，模型在准确性和生成效率上均优于自回归和基于扩散的基线。

Conclusion: 提出的流匹配框架为长时标记事件序列建模提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

TL;DR: Agnostics是一种语言无关的后训练流程，通过行为验证和RLVR技术，显著提升了低资源编程语言的代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源编程语言上表现不佳的问题，避免为每种语言单独开发数据集和测试工具。

Method: 使用LLM重写单元测试数据集为I/O格式，提供配置指导验证器编译和运行目标语言，并应用RLVR技术。

Result: 在五种低资源语言上显著提升模型性能，部分模型达到或超越更大规模模型的水平，并创下新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Agnostics简化了多语言RL后训练流程，通过开源数据集和工具，使低资源语言的代码生成更加高效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: HNO是一种新型神经算子架构，通过希尔伯特变换增强信号处理能力，解决FNO的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNO在频域卷积中表现优异，但受限于傅里叶变换的周期性假设，且缺乏对相位和瞬时幅度的显式建模。

Method: HNO通过希尔伯特变换将输入信号映射为解析表示，显式提取瞬时幅度和相位信息，再进行谱卷积。

Result: HNO有望更有效地建模因果、相位敏感和非平稳系统的算子。

Conclusion: HNO结合信号处理理论，为神经算子提供了新的设计思路，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

Motivation: 研究是否可以直接在概率测度上实现动态，以扩展对神经网络的理解和应用。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型和Wasserstein梯度流理论，推导出概率测度的训练动态，并引入GM层。

Result: GM层在简单分类任务中表现与传统网络相当，且行为显著不同。

Conclusion: GM层为神经网络架构提供了新的可能性，展示了与传统层不同的动态行为。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

Conclusion: 该方法为表面臭氧偏差建模提供了有效工具，支持政策决策和公共健康措施，同时强调了土地利用信息的重要性。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于提升城市尺度臭氧偏差的科学理解，为环境政策改进提供支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的水位预测对生态系统管理至关重要，但现有深度学习模型在跨领域泛化和适应性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出RAF框架，利用外部历史数据档案检索相似水文事件，结合相似性和互信息方法进行预测。

Result: 在Everglades真实数据上的实验表明，RAF显著提高了水位预测的准确性。

Conclusion: RAF展示了在环境水文中的潜力，为生态系统管理中的自适应AI方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 当前新生儿癫痫检测模型的评估方法存在不一致性和偏差，导致模型可比性和可解释性不足，且缺乏严格的验证。

Method: 使用真实和合成的癫痫标注数据，评估了标准性能指标、共识策略和人类专家水平等效测试，考虑了类别不平衡、评分者间一致性和评分者数量等因素。

Result: Matthews和Pearson相关系数在类别不平衡下表现优于AUC；共识类型对评分者数量和一致性水平敏感；多评分者图灵测试（使用Fleiss k）最能捕捉专家级AI性能。

Conclusion: 建议报告至少一个平衡指标、敏感性、特异性、PPV和NPV、多评分者图灵测试结果（使用Fleiss k），并在独立验证集上进行评估，以全面评估AI方法。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Method: 提出了选择敏感性（ΔQ）的数学框架，量化了适应效果与结果一致性之间的权衡，并通过在MultiNLI语料库上的实验验证了理论关系。

Result: 实验表明，高适应性策略（如基于梯度的选择）性能优越但可复制性差，而低适应性策略可复制性较好（失败率低于7%）。源域预训练可显著降低失败率（高达30%）。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了性能与可复制性权衡的指导原则，并强调了现代迁移学习系统中可复制性设计的重要性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于Transformer的模型在仇恨言论检测中的应用，使用MetaHate数据集评估了BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA等模型，其中微调后的ELECTRA表现最佳（F1分数：0.8980）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在社交媒体上广泛存在，对社会、心理和身体造成严重影响，需要开发高效的自动化检测方法。

Method: 使用MetaHate数据集（包含36个数据集和120万个样本），评估了BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA等Transformer模型。

Result: 微调后的ELECTRA模型表现最佳，F1分数为0.8980。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，但仍面临讽刺、隐晦语言和标签噪声等挑战。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded

Motivation: 由于现实应用复杂性增加，分布偏移和数据不平衡等问题凸显，但缺乏统一的评估平台，因此开发了ALScope。

Method: ALScope整合了10个CV和NLP数据集及21种DAL算法，支持灵活配置实验因素，如OOD样本比例和类别不平衡比例。

Result: 实验表明DAL算法性能因领域和任务设置而异，非标准场景下算法有待改进，部分算法性能好但耗时较长。

Conclusion: ALScope为DAL研究提供了统一评估平台，揭示了算法在不同场景下的表现差异和改进空间。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Conclusion: ASkDAgger通过平衡查询频率与失败率，显著提升了模仿学习的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

TL;DR: SEA框架通过分解集成误差为个体性能和多样性两部分，提供更精确的调整能力，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集成学习方法（如Bagging和Boosting）缺乏对准确性与多样性权衡的精确控制，NCL虽有改进但理论界限松散。

Method: 提出SEA框架，将集成误差分解为个体性能项和多样性项，引入可调参数以精细控制。

Result: 实验表明SEA在回归和分类任务中均优于基线方法，调整范围更广且多样性变化更一致。

Conclusion: SEA提供了更灵活的调整能力和更优的性能，理论界限更紧，适用于精细调优。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式方法精度和泛化能力不足，深度学习方法计算成本高且解释性差，TrajEvo旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优异，尤其在OOD场景中超越现有方法。

Conclusion: TrajEvo为快速、可解释且泛化能力强的轨迹预测启发式设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

TL;DR: 本文设计了两种压缩去中心化算法，分别用于解决不同场景下的非凸随机优化问题，结合动量技术和消息压缩技术，实现了快速收敛和低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中动量加速和压缩通信已被使用，但理论上证明它们在去中心化算法中的组合有效性仍具挑战性，需同时控制共识误差、压缩误差和动量梯度偏差。

Method: 针对梯度有界场景，提出压缩去中心化自适应方法；针对数据异构且梯度无界场景，提出压缩去中心化重球法，结合梯度跟踪技术。

Result: 两种方法均达到最优收敛速率，可实现线性加速，并在特定误差容忍范围内采用与拓扑无关的算法参数。实验显示在DNN和Transformer训练中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为去中心化非凸随机优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，阻碍了临床应用的推广。

Method: MENDR采用离散小波包变换分解EEG信号，并通过黎曼流形变换器学习对称正定矩阵嵌入。

Result: MENDR在多个临床任务中接近最先进性能，且参数更少，支持信号重建和几何可视化。

Conclusion: MENDR为高效、可解释且临床适用的EEG分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

Conclusion: RCUKF在复杂系统中表现出色，尤其在数据驱动模型可能失效的高维或混沌场景中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中易受虚假相关性影响，导致模型依赖统计捷径而非真实因果关系，影响泛化。

Method: 构建多关系图捕捉模态内和模态间依赖，通过注意力机制分离因果特征与捷径特征，应用后门调整动态结合特征。

Result: 在多个标准数据集和OOD测试集上验证了模型能有效抑制偏差并提升性能。

Conclusion: MMCI通过因果干预解决了多模态情感分析中的虚假相关性问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

Method: R-Zero通过Challenger生成任务，Solver解决任务，两者共同进化，形成自我改进的课程。

Result: R-Zero显著提升了LLM的推理能力，例如在数学推理和通用推理基准上分别提升了6.49和7.54分。

Conclusion: R-Zero为超越人类智能的AI系统提供了一种无需人工干预的自主进化路径。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，SPaRFT在多个推理基准测试中达到或超越现有方法，同时减少100倍样本需求。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精心设计的性能驱动训练课程能以最少资源解锁LLM的强大推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Motivation: AR系统在提升任务表现的同时可能导致认知隧道效应，降低情境意识，尤其在安全关键场景（如心肺复苏）中需平衡虚拟指导与对突发事件的警觉。

Method: 开发AR应用提供实时CPR反馈，通过用户研究模拟突发事件，收集SA指标（观察、问卷、眼动数据），并设计FixGraphPool模型分析眼动图结构。

Result: 高SA水平与更大的眼跳幅度/速度、更少的虚拟内容注视相关；FixGraphPool模型（83%准确率）优于传统方法，有效捕捉时空注意力模式。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪可有效建模AR中的SA，为设计兼顾安全性与情境意识的AR系统提供依据，FixGraphPool展示了时空数据处理优势。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Motivation: 预训练权重是现代深度学习的基石，但如何获取包含更多知识的权重仍是一个关键问题。

Result: 实验表明KNOW预测优于传统微调和简单权重预测，显著提升下游任务表现。

Conclusion: 研究为重新解释遗忘动态以推动知识转移提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Result: 在多种节点和图分类、回归任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 联合学习能量函数和切向流对图神经网络有效。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Result: 实验表明，Integrated Influence在数据归因和错误标签识别任务中比现有方法更可靠。

Conclusion: Integrated Influence通过基线方法和退化过程，提供了更全面和灵活的数据归因解释。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了冷启动问题，提升了偏好学习的样本效率和适用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

Conclusion: 通过多视角弱监督信号的互补整合，显著提升了弱监督学习的性能，为有限标注数据场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard上达到86.02%准确率，比标准GRPO提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法在代码预训练模型上表现突出，结构化语言生成能力为强化学习提供了优势。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to

*Thinh Nguyen,Trung Phan,Binh T. Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HFedATM是一种新的分层联邦学习方法，通过卷积滤波器对齐和正则化聚合解决域偏移问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层联邦学习（HFL）存在域偏移问题，影响模型在未见目标域的表现，而现有联邦域泛化（FedDG）方法未充分整合到HFL中。

Method: 提出HFedATM方法，通过滤波器最优传输对齐和收缩感知正则化均值聚合，分层对齐和合并模型。

Result: 实验表明HFedATM在多数据集上显著优于现有FedDG基线，且保持计算和通信效率。

Conclusion: HFedATM通过理论分析和实验验证，实现了更紧的泛化误差界和稳定训练，为分层联邦学习中的域偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

TL;DR: 深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间中表现出超收敛现象，逼近精度超越传统数值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为神经网络在偏微分方程（PDE）中的应用提供统一的理论基础，填补误差估计理论的空白。

Method: 分析深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间中的逼近能力，使用常用激活函数。

Result: 在W^{m,p}-范数下，逼近误差优于有限元和谱方法等传统数值方法。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络在PDE弱解逼近中具有显著优势，为科学计算提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSEO框架通过优化后处理堆叠集成，提升AutoML性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CASH方法在集成阶段采用固定策略，无法适应任务特性。

Method: 通过二元二次规划选择基础模型，并引入多层堆叠机制。

Result: 在80个数据集上，PSEO平均测试排名最佳（2.96）。

Conclusion: PSEO显著优于现有AutoML系统和集成学习方法。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

Conclusion: 领域驱动的RL指标为复杂系统的模型评估提供了有效工具，尤其在疾病建模等实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法假设客户端静态参与，不适用于动态客户端加入的现实场景。

Method: 基于中央超网络生成个性化模型，使用批特定掩码保护知识，并采用数据回放策略促进知识迁移。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上优于现有方法，实现了稳定性和适应性。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在动态环境中表现优异，兼顾了性能稳定性和资源效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

TL;DR: S$^2$M-Former是一种新型的尖峰对称混合框架，用于解决听觉注意力检测（AAD）中的能量效率问题，通过生物启发的架构和轻量级设计实现高性能和低功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG-based AAD缺乏能够充分利用互补EEG特征且满足能量效率限制的协同框架。

Method: 提出S$^2$M-Former，采用尖峰驱动的对称架构和轻量级1D token序列，减少参数和能耗。

Result: 在三个AAD基准测试中表现优异，参数减少14.7倍，能耗降低5.8倍，性能超越现有SNN基线。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former是一种高效、低功耗的AAD解决方案，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时通常忽略对齐质量与计算成本之间的平衡，HIA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤，减少推理调用。

Result: 在HelpSteer和ComPRed数据集上，HIA在相同推理预算下优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: HIA在低推理预算下仍有效，为可扩展的个性化LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS

the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,

outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

Method: PITI-DeepONet学习时间导数算子，结合经典时间步进方案，并通过残差监测评估预测质量。

Result: 在多个基准问题上，PITI-DeepONet显著降低了误差（如热方程误差减少84%）。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet为复杂时间依赖PDE的长期可靠积分提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Method: 提出Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR)框架，通过单调性约束学习和多任务蒸馏整合竞价信号，并采用异步近线推理实现实时更新。

Result: 在阿里巴巴展示广告平台上的实验显示，BAR使平台收入增加4.32%，正向操作广告的展示量提升22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR有效解决了多阶段不一致问题，显著提升了广告系统的性能。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Conclusion: 该方法为实时ROP预测提供了可靠解决方案，具有显著的工程应用价值。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

Motivation: 现有倾向得分加权方法（如IPW）在处理高方差倾向得分时不稳定，影响选择偏差处理和治疗效果估计。

Method: 提出Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)，利用去混杂因子构建稳定权重，优先选择低混杂样本。

Result: 实验表明DFW在协变量平衡和治疗效果估计上优于IPW和CBPS。

Conclusion: DFW通过稳定权重和更好的协变量平衡，有效提升了治疗效果估计的准确性。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的联邦学习框架LIGHTYEAR，通过本地验证集计算一致性分数，选择个性化更新集合并进行聚合，提升了在异构和对抗条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习的集中式架构存在单点故障、个性化不足和对异构数据适应性差的问题，需要一种更灵活的去中心化方法。

Method: 采用P2P拓扑结构，每个客户端通过本地验证集计算更新的一致性分数，选择个性化更新集合并加入正则化项进行聚合。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在客户端性能上优于集中式基准和现有P2P方法，尤其在异构和对抗条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR框架通过去中心化和个性化更新选择，显著提升了联邦学习在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

TL;DR: Cross-LoRA是一种无需数据的框架，用于在不同基础模型间迁移LoRA模块，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PEFT方法（如LoRA）与基础模型架构紧密耦合，限制了其在异构预训练大模型中的适用性。

Method: Cross-LoRA包含LoRA-Align（通过SVD和线性变换对齐子空间）和LoRA-Shift（将源LoRA权重投影到目标模型空间）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Cross-LoRA相对基础模型提升高达5.26%，性能接近直接训练的LoRA适配器。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA是一种高效、轻量级的跨模型LoRA迁移方法，适用于异构LLMs。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE)方法，通过分解和共享基础矩阵实现模型压缩，显著减少了参数数量且精度损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE压缩方法在压缩率较低时仍会导致较大的精度损失（7-14%），因此需要一种更高效的压缩方法。

Method: 将每个专家的权重矩阵分解为W=AB，其中A为专家独有，B通过共享基础矩阵线性组合表示，并通过最小化重构误差学习分解。

Result: MoBE在Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507、DeepSeek-V3-0324和Kimi-K2-Instruct等模型上实现了24%-30%的参数减少，精度损失仅为1%-2%。

Conclusion: MoBE是一种高效的MoE压缩方法，显著降低了参数数量且保持了高精度。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋叶绿素浓度是生态系统健康和碳循环强度的重要指标，准确预测对赤潮预警和生态响应至关重要。

Method: 使用LSTM-RF混合模型，结合多源海洋数据（温度、盐度、溶解氧等），并采用标准化处理和滑动窗口方法。

Result: LSTM-RF模型在测试集上的R²为0.5386，MSE为0.005806，MAE为0.057147，显著优于单独使用LSTM或RF。

Conclusion: 该模型为海洋生态变量的高频预测提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

TL;DR: FlowState是一种新型时间序列基础模型，通过状态空间模型编码器和函数基解码器解决了现有模型的泛化、适应性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在泛化、适应性和计算效率方面存在不足，FlowState旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用状态空间模型编码器和函数基解码器，支持连续时间建模和动态时间尺度调整。

Result: FlowState在GIFT-ZS和Chronos-ZS基准测试中表现最佳，且模型更小、数据需求更低。

Conclusion: FlowState通过创新设计和高效预训练策略，成为时间序列预测的先进解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调无法捕捉用户隐含反馈信号（如停留时间、情感极性等），需要更有效的方法来对齐用户偏好。

Method: 使用RLHF方法，通过奖励模型和近端策略优化（PPO）来最大化用户隐含反馈信号，优化LLM生成的推荐。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在推荐准确性、连贯性和用户满意度上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 隐含信号对齐可以高效实现可扩展和用户自适应的对话推荐系统设计。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to

Motivation: 深度学习模型的计算瓶颈促使研究者探索如何高效调度批量大小和学习率以平衡效率和收敛性。

Method: 基于随机一阶预言机（SFO）复杂度理论，推导了批量大小和学习率的最优增长调度策略。

Result: 通过实验验证了理论推导的调度策略能有效减少梯度评估次数，提升训练效率。

Conclusion: 研究为大规模批量训练提供了理论和实践指导，优化了深度学习的训练效率。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Motivation: 研究发现SGD的收敛行为对批大小和学习率设置高度敏感，因此需要一种自适应策略来优化这些参数。

Method: 通过观察训练过程中全梯度范数的衰减，动态调整批大小和学习率。

Result: 实验表明，基于该策略的自适应联合调度器比现有调度器具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 自适应调度策略能有效加速SGD的收敛，尤其是在深度神经网络中。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

Conclusion: USP通过协同优化三个关键方面，显著提升了半监督持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

Motivation: 传统CAT方法在训练前需预定义高质量数据组，易出错且效率低。

Method: OCAT冻结大部分模型参数，仅微调少量语料相关参数。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，分别提升3.6和1.8 chrF。

Conclusion: OCAT轻量、抗过拟合，且效果优于其他先进微调技术。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

Result: 算法在奖励分布明确时表现与潜在老虎机相当，在奖励尺度不同时更优。

Conclusion: 放宽假设的方法在实际应用中更具灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

<details>

Motivation: 现代RL后训练方法在同一GPU集群上串行切换推理和训练任务，违反了SPMD假设，导致效率低下。

Method: Echo引入两种轻量同步协议：顺序拉取模式和异步推送-拉取模式，分别优化统计效率和硬件利用率。

Result: 在分布式集群上训练多个RL任务，Echo在收敛速度和最终奖励上与基线相当，同时将轨迹生成卸载到边缘硬件。

Conclusion: Echo证明利用分散异构资源可以实现数据中心级性能的大规模RL训练。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种高效的后门防御机制，尤其在少量干净样本情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Result: 通过实验比较了SGD和Adam优化器在有/无累积自适应机制下的表现，并与最新方法进行了对比。

Conclusion: 本文阐明了自适应学习率策略的实际优势及其适用场景。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NegBio-VAE通过负二项分布改进VAE，更准确地模拟神经活动的离散性和过分散性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和Poisson-VAE无法准确模拟神经活动的变异性，尤其是均值和方差的刚性约束限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 引入负二项分布，开发两种ELBO优化方案和两种可微分重参数化策略，扩展VAE框架。

Result: 实验表明，NegBio-VAE在重建保真度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模过分散性对模拟神经活动至关重要，NegBio-VAE为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

*Jiansheng Rao,Jiayi Li,Zhizhi Gong,Soummya Kar,Haoxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CR-FMOL是一种新的联邦多目标学习框架，通过偏好锥约束确保客户端公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FedAvg在联邦学习中忽视少数客户端公平性的问题。

Method: 使用锥约束的Pareto-MTL子问题，结合FMGDA/FSMGDA步骤。

Result: 在非IID数据上提升客户端公平性，后期性能接近FedAvg。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL是首个实现客户端Pareto最优的联邦MOO框架。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的因果优化方法GCPO，通过引入结构因果模型和因果奖励调整，显著提升了大型语言模型在专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GRPO忽略了候选回答之间的语义交互，导致优化效果受限。

Method: 提出结构因果模型（SCM）揭示隐藏依赖关系，并基于因果分析设计GCPO方法，包括因果奖励调整和KL正则化。

Result: GCPO在多个推理基准测试中表现优于GRPO等现有方法。

Conclusion: GCPO通过整合因果结构，有效提升了语言模型在专业任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: MLES是一种新型的程序化策略发现方法，结合多模态大语言模型和进化搜索，旨在解决深度强化学习在控制任务中性能高但解释性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在控制任务中表现出色，但缺乏解释性，影响信任和实际部署。MLES旨在同时提升性能和解释性。

Method: MLES利用多模态大语言模型生成策略，并通过进化机制自动优化策略，结合视觉反馈驱动的行为分析以识别失败模式并改进策略。

Result: 实验表明，MLES在两种控制任务中与PPO性能相当，同时提供透明的控制逻辑和可追溯的设计过程。

Conclusion: MLES克服了预定义领域特定语言的限制，支持知识迁移和重用，是下一代可解释控制策略发现的有力候选。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

Motivation: 研究竞争风险被错误分类为截尾数据的问题，及其对生存估计和算法公平性的影响。

Result: 实证分析表明，忽略竞争风险会放大现有差异，尤其影响高风险个体。

Conclusion: 生存模型必须考虑竞争风险以提高准确性、减少差异，并支持更好的决策。

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新的安全感知MCTS方法（CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS），以解决传统MCTS在极端高风险场景下缺乏尾部风险控制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS仅基于期望回报决策，无法有效控制高风险尾部风险，可能导致严重后果。现有方法缺乏对极端风险的严格保障。

Method: 1. CVaR-MCTS：嵌入条件风险价值（CVaR）以控制最坏(1-α)%场景的期望损失。2. W-MCTS：引入Wasserstein模糊集解决尾部风险估计偏差。

Result: 实验证明，两种方法在多种模拟环境中优于基线，实现了稳健的尾部风险保障，同时提高了奖励和稳定性。

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS通过严格尾部风险控制和偏差校正，显著提升了MCTS在高风险场景下的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因多尺度时间动态和真实数据不规则性存在局限性，需更准确的能源时间序列预测方法。

Method: 提出EnergyPatchTST，包含多尺度特征提取、蒙特卡洛概率预测、未来变量集成路径及预训练-微调策略。

Result: 实验显示预测误差降低7-12%，并提供可靠不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST为能源领域时间序列预测提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

Motivation: 神经网络内部表示的形成机制尚不明确，研究任务难度如何影响其表示拓扑和鲁棒性，有助于理解模型行为并指导实际应用。

Method: 使用五种探针方法（剪枝、二值化、噪声注入、符号翻转和二分图随机化）分析MLP在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上的表现。

Result: 发现二值化权重对困难任务模型性能影响显著，而简单任务模型鲁棒性强；噪声注入可能提升性能；符号结构对保持高精度至关重要。

Conclusion: 符号二分图拓扑在表示学习中起关键作用，研究结果为模型压缩和可解释性提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

Motivation: 当前AI系统评估常依赖真实标签，但获取成本高。研究旨在开发无需真实标签的评估机制，利用游戏抵抗性确保评估质量。

Method: 通过数据处理不等式证明f-互信息是唯一游戏抵抗机制，并比较不同信息度量（如总变差距离）的样本复杂度。

Result: 在10个领域（如翻译、同行评审）中，信息论机制能完美区分忠实与策略性代理，且对抗操纵鲁棒性比现有方法高10-100倍。

Conclusion: f-互信息机制在特定压缩比（10:1）下表现最佳，为AI系统评估提供了高效且鲁棒的新方法。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的死亡率预测任务中，该方法优于现有模型，提高了性能和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 利用临床存在信息可提升预测模型的性能和可迁移性，尤其在部署到新环境时。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

Conclusion: MoMA为多模态EHR数据的临床预测提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架自动识别关键视图组合，为多视图聚类提供高效且无参数的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

Motivation: 概率电路（PCs）在数据有限时容易过拟合，通常是由于收敛到尖锐的优化点导致泛化能力差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能引导PCs收敛到更平坦的优化点，显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: Hessian-based正则化是一种有效的方法，能够改善PCs的训练效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

TL;DR: Fairy±i提出了一种新的2位量化框架，通过提升全精度模型的精度上限，并在复数域中实现高效量化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT研究仅关注最小化量化误差，未尝试突破全精度模型的精度上限。

Method: 利用复数域的表征优势，将权重映射到四次单位根{±1, ±i}，实现无乘法推理。

Result: Fairy±i在PPL和下游任务中超越现有2位量化方法的精度上限，同时保持存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为极低比特约束下构建高精度实用LLM开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Result: LLMs结合迭代学习能生成可解释且相当准确的程序，性能接近最先进ML方法，且训练样本需求显著减少。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成计算机表型方面具有潜力，可支持临床决策，尤其在资源有限的情况下。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种扩展PyKEEN框架的方法，集成了多种高级负采样策略，以提升知识图谱嵌入模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱嵌入方法在缺乏负样本时需要人工生成，但大多数库仅支持基本策略，限制了性能提升。

Method: 开发了一个PyKEEN框架的扩展，集成了静态和动态负采样策略，保持与现有工作流的兼容性。

Result: 通过实证研究展示了扩展对链接预测任务性能的提升，并提供了设计更有效策略的见解。

Conclusion: 该扩展不仅增强了PyKEEN的功能，还简化了嵌入方法的开发和定制。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Conclusion: 一毒假设为后门攻击的最小毒样本需求提供了理论支持，并揭示了攻击者在有限背景知识下的潜在威胁。

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Motivation: 当前强化学习管道存在优势崩溃和滚动静默问题，导致梯度更新不理想，影响长期学习效率。

Method: 提出Shuffle-R1框架，包括成对轨迹采样和基于优势的轨迹重组，以优化梯度信号和批次组成。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Shuffle-R1表现优于现有强化学习基线，且开销极小。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的调整对提升MLLM中强化学习训练效率至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究机器人通过主动分享事件反应对人类感知其情感影响的效果，发现200ms延迟对小型非人形机器人最有效，100ms延迟则让人感觉对机器人影响最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器人如何在社交场景中通过主动分享反应来增强人类对其情感影响的感知。

Method: 设计了两个实验：一个隔离反应元素，另一个测试不同反应延迟时间，分别有84和110名参与者。

Result: 机器人主动分享反应显著提升情感影响感知；200ms延迟最有效，100ms延迟让人感觉对机器人影响最大。

Conclusion: 机器人反应时间对人类感知有显著影响，200ms适用于一般场景，100ms适用于强调人类影响的场景。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

Motivation: 传统机器人控制依赖精确模型和预定义动作，难以适应复杂现实场景，而人类通过直觉和物理理解高效决策。

Method: 提出Memory Graph记录任务交互场景，设计Intuitive Perceptor提取物理关系和功能。

Result: 机器人能在新场景中推断适当交互行为，无需重复指令。

Conclusion: INTENTION框架提升了机器人在多样化场景中的自主操作能力。

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

Motivation: 解决多机器人在已知环境中同时覆盖线性特征和区域时的路径规划问题，兼顾服务与探索两种功能角色的高效协作。

Method: 采用层次循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合莫尔斯理论分析流形附着过程，并通过边序列反向传播生成最优路径。

Result: HCMR算法在路径长度上至少提升10.0%，任务时间平均减少16.9%，且确保无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下具有最优性，显著优于现有规划方法。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

Result: 实验显示HDDPG在成功率和平均奖励上分别提升至少56.59%和519.03。

Conclusion: HDDPG有效解决了DDPG的局限性，显著提升了迷宫导航任务的性能。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动优化感知和利用记忆解决歧义，显著提升了复杂环境中的视觉语言接地能力，且无需标注数据或模型微调。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

Result: 研究发现不同捷径方法在不同场景下表现各异，组合策略能显著提升性能与运行时间的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为多机器人臂运动规划提供了实用的捷径方法选择和组合策略，优化了轨迹质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

Abstract: Robot teleoperation (RTo) has emerged as a viable alternative to local
control, particularly when human intervention is still necessary. This research
aims to study the distance effect on user perception in RTo, exploring the
potential of teleoperated robots for older adult care. We propose an evaluation
of non-expert users' perception of long-distance RTo, examining how their
perception changes before and after interaction, as well as comparing it to
that of locally operated robots. We have designed a specific protocol
consisting of multiple questionnaires, along with a dedicated software
architecture using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Unity. The results
revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote
robot conditions, suggesting that robots may be a viable alternative to
traditional local control.

TL;DR: Chemist Eye是一个分布式安全监控系统，用于提升自动驾驶实验室（SDL）的安全性和情境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶实验室中，机器人和自动化设备的引入增加了安全复杂性，尤其是火灾和PPE合规性问题。

Method: 系统整合了RGB、深度和红外摄像头，通过视觉语言模型（VLM）进行决策，实时监控并响应安全隐患。

Result: 在真实SDL环境中测试，Chemist Eye对安全隐患的识别和决策性能分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye能有效提升SDL的安全性，适用于实时监控和应急响应。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

Motivation: 解决机器人服装操作中因高维度、复杂动态和类别内变化导致的泛化难题。

Method: 提出FCBV-Net，基于3D点云，利用预训练的几何特征预测双动作值，下游可训练组件学习任务策略。

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net在未见过的服装上效率下降仅11.5%，最终覆盖率达89%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 解耦几何理解与双动作值学习能显著提升类别级泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

Conclusion: TAVP通过任务感知的视觉表示学习，显著提升了机器人操作的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,
including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the

child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义行为序列或行为树，缺乏灵活性。GhostShell旨在通过LLM实现实时、动态的行为编程。

Method: 采用流式XML函数令牌解析器、动态函数接口映射器和多通道调度器，支持同步和异步函数调用。

Result: 在34个真实任务中，GhostShell达到0.85的行为正确率，响应速度提升66倍，且在多模态任务中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: GhostShell为机器人行为编程提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于复杂任务场景。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: GF-VLA通过信息论场景表示和语言融合，显著提升了机器人从人类视频中学习复杂任务的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Result: 在72次交互实验中，机器人成功学习并泛化到新物理上下文。

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架能有效指导机器人行为适应，并具备泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 探讨机器人如何在高强度冲突中通过情感表达缓解人类的敌意。

Method: 使用定制的情感机器人和105名参与者模拟冲突情境，测试五种表达方式的效果。

Result: 所有表达方式均能有效缓解冲突，运动方式表现显著不同，参与者对机器人受影响程度的感知相似。

Conclusion: 缓解高强度冲突更需机器人具备社会情境意识和适当反应能力，而非特定表达方式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

Result: 实验表明推理时间大幅减少，性能与全步去噪扩散策略相当。

Conclusion: 新方法为预训练扩散模型提供了高效推理方案，特别适用于资源密集型大模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Conclusion: CleanUpBench连接了低级技能评估和全场景测试，为日常环境中的具身智能提供了可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Abstract: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for
robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and
simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is
a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the
spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in
a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent
representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,
flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference
across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable
evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural
simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.
The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite
measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action
alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable
and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied
intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.
