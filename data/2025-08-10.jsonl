To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot."}

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo.

To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data\nscarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first\nmulti-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to\ngeneralize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.\nExtensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases\nthe number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder\ndatasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching\nDirection Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,\nachieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/Beryl2000/EndoMatcher."}

However, real-world applications face significant\nocclusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection\nfeatures from both the regression and classification branches of an object\ndetector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the\nfeature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative\nKalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,\nintegrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.\nBy combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed\nmethod offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded\nenvironments where occlusions are prevalent."}

As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation\nlimitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough\nwith more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from\nprior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise\nvariable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of\nvisual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct\nvisual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on\nmainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet\n50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.\nFLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression\nmodel achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,\noutperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.\nCode and models are available: https://github.com/zhuangshaobin/WeTok."}

Furthermore, we also provide\ntheoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound\nof graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently\noutperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and\nadaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios."}

In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that\nleverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize\nknowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on\nprogressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which\ncan be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger\ndataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively.

In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

At its core, GE-Base is\na large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the\nspatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in\na structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent\nrepresentations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,\nflow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference\nacross diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable\nevaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural\nsimulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.\nThe platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite\nmeasuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action\nalignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable\nand practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied\nintelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly."}
