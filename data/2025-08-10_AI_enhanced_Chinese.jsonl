To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u662f\u5426\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0200ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u975e\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c100ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5219\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u89c9\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u4e00\u7ec4\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7ec4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0884\u4eba\u548c110\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\uff1b200ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c100ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c200ms\u548c100ms\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08HDDPG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u3001\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u56e0\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u56f0\u96be\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "HDDPG\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728ROS\u548cGazebo\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHDDPG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1156.59%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u52a0\u81f3\u5c11519.03\u3002", "conclusion": "HDDPG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DDPG\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Teacher embeddings are\naligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,\nthen fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by\ncombining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement.

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRADAR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main\ntypes: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep\nreasoning (e.g., \"what is in the image?\"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,\nwhich concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle\nclues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning.

In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained\napproach.

Despite being\ntrained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate\nshift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)\nparameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the\ndistribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of\nperspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without\nretraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens\nas a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for\nalignment.

IAS 2023", "summary": "This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate\nbehavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the\nphysical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It\nconsists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that\nlearns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As\nphysical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured\nphysical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize\nbetween behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior\nin line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it\ninteracts with.

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios.

Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur.

The defusing of\nthe situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the\nconflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a\ncustom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test\nparticipants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can\nsuccessfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of\nthe confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement\nmodality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test\nparticipants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the\nrobot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities.

However, this method\nhas some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier\ntransform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond\nphase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information\nto learn an effective network. We introduce the \\textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator\n(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by\nincorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by\nfirst mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert\ntransform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information\nexplicit features for the learning process.

A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to\nmimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to\ndevelop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,\nsuch systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the\nability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky\ncontrol systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for\ndesigning and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing\ndistributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines\n3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight\nactuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We\ndeveloped LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby\nachieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,\nwhich in turn results in global deformation of the robot.

However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive\ndecoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting\nfrom over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose\nSODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in\nimage compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step\nrefinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained\nVAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the\niterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve\nfidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is\nfaithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing\ntraining strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.\nExtensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance.

Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but\nlimited data, leading to significant performance degradation in\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated\nexceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale\ntraining, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion\nmodels is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth\ncompletion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain\nremarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a\ndepth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and\nsemantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth\ninformation into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation\napproach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse\ndepth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local\nconsistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable\ncorrection module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real\ndepth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution\ndatasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets.

Recently, pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance\nby leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning\nvision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain\ngaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which\nis known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence\nof modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to\nsuboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified\nmodality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and\nmodality-invariant components. During training, different modality components\nare disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.\nAt test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined\nto maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level\nmodality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize\nsamples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones.

In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect.

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice.

This\nwould allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of\ndeployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to\nbiological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,\nwhich reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the\nreason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of\nvideo, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at\nodds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we\npropose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead\nof raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling\nbuffer.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This\ndecomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss\nfunction, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,\nthus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its\nvariants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more\nconsistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical\nbounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical\nexperiments.

This process yields a targeted,\nself-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.\nEmpirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across\ndifferent backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on\nmath-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Zero\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff08Challenger\u548cSolver\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "R-Zero\u901a\u8fc7Challenger\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cSolver\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "R-Zero\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.49\u548c7.54\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Zero\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, these auxiliary components tend to\nintroduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,\nidentity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the\nneed for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly\nleverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer\nperformance.

Accurate and robust segmentation\nmodels are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision\nmaking across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in\nimage characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of\ngeneralizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.\nThis model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for\nmodality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major\nchallenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT\nvs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these\nissues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables\nmultimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method\nintegrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module\nthat harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local\ntraining. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset\nand a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was\ninitially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its\nperformance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT\ndata were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data\nscenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test\ncases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.\nIn the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized\nperformance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a\n10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong\ncross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedGIN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5272\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedGIN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GIN\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cFedGIN\u6bd4\u65e0GIN\u7684FL\u63d0\u534712-18% Dice\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u534730%\uff08MRI\uff09\u548c10%\uff08CT\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FedGIN\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure.

Furthermore, we also provide\ntheoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound\nof graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently\noutperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and\nadaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPA++\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u90bb\u5c45\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u57df\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u5224\u522b\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8c31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u90bb\u5c45\u611f\u77e5\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SPA++\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "VFlowOpt\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u526a\u679d90%\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1189% KV-Cache\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "VFlowOpt\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cLMMs\u3002"}}

Existing works\neither directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify\nusing attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some\nresearchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in\nthe target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into\nthe model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large\nmodels, which further limits their overall performance. To address the\naforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based\nvision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a\npre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\nand reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and\nlanguage generation.

FAVS\nemploys a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse\ngeometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained\nalignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies\nhigh-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,\nCVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs\nthe original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a\ndiffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision\nfrom extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and\ntheir associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional\nsensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method\ncapable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple\nvehicle configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Arbiviewgen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFAVS\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u56fe\u62fc\u63a5\uff09\u548cCVC-SSL\uff08\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u9700\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u4f4d\u59ff\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "Arbiviewgen\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53ef\u63a7\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5DFW\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IPW\uff09\u56e0\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u800c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u6df7\u6dc6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDFW\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eIPW\u548cCBPS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DFW\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

The standardised treatment and sliding window\napproach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an\ninnovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological\nvariables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u548cRF\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6d77\u6d0b\u53f6\u7eff\u7d20\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u6d0b\u53f6\u7eff\u7d20\u6d53\u5ea6\u662f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u78b3\u5faa\u73af\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8d64\u6f6e\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u751f\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LSTM-RF\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6d77\u6d0b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u76d0\u5ea6\u3001\u6eb6\u89e3\u6c27\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "LSTM-RF\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aR^2\u4e3a0.5386\uff0cMSE\u4e3a0.005806\uff0cMAE\u4e3a0.057147\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u548cRF\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which\nrequire training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns\nat each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input\nscale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved\nefficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves\nrobustness and accelerates training.

To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor\nSplatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with\nmultiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation\nsupervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a\nfilter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to\nenhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,\nto achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is\ndeveloped to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components\ncharacterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a\nfrequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of\nprimitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless\nintegration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality\nof novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat\noutperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.\nRemarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously\nreduced number of primitives and memory consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "3DGabSplat\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D Gabor\u7684\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u54113D\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f4e\u901a\u7279\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u57fa\u5143\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D Gabor\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9891\u73873D Gabor\u6838\u5f62\u6210\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1CUDA\u5149\u6805\u5316\u5668\u548c\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c3DGabSplat\u5728PSNR\u4e0a\u6bd43DGS\u63d0\u53471.35 dB\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "3DGabSplat\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e3DGS\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning.

However, most CVL methods\noutput only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant\nobservations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess\nlocalization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.\nTo tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an\na-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering\nout mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m\nto under 3\\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean\nlocalization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from\n$\\mathbf{3.42^{\\circ}}$ to $\\mathbf{1.24^{\\circ}}$, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods.

While mainstream\napproaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to\ncapture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet\nmost rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial\npositions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack\nspecificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.\nIn this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for\npathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based\non patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its\nneighbors via attention-weighted edges.

While chirality has been extensively\nstudied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point\nclouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex\ndescriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body\ntransformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and\nright symmetric parts.

However, real-world applications face significant\nocclusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection\nfeatures from both the regression and classification branches of an object\ndetector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the\nfeature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative\nKalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,\nintegrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.\nBy combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed\nmethod offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded\nenvironments where occlusions are prevalent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u8eab\u6846\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5934\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2\nintroduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent\nobject disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller\nobjects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,\nrain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot\nsequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,\nreflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20\nrepresentative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent\nperformance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%\non MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar\ndeclines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These\nresults highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS\nmethods still struggle under real-world complexities.

Project page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/GAP", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving\nfast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and\neasily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point\nclouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on\nobscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template\nprotection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We\npropose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages\nthe latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize\nprivacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to\nirreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code\nderived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through\na carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric\nrequirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable\nfaces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring\nany modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nFaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing\nsignificantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on\ncommercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods.
