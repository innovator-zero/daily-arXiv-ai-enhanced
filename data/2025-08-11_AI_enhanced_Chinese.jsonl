However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

We establish a theoretical\nexistence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit\nchaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and\nthe Kolmogorov flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684nudging\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684nudging\u9879\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684nudging\u9879\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eKazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lorenz 96\u6a21\u578b\u3001Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cKolmogorov\u6d41\u7b49\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcnudging\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,\nefficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces\nInertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually\nmeaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU\nsequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs.

For high-level tasks such as classification, a\nfrozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal\nsupervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a\nhybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE\nembeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both\nskull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited\nconditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our\nframework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its\nsuitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MRI\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Masked Autoencoder (MAE)\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u961f\u5217\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u5934\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784MAE-FUnet\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM.

Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises\nbetween fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the\ndual signal.

To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal\nfirst and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.\nJointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with\nheteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures.

Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series.

Among them, the Swin\nTransformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale\nrepresentations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.\nHowever, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high\ncomputational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense\nprediction in videos.

We\nintroduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,\nfine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal\ncoherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,\nTCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining\nfine-grained details while significantly reducing computation.

Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse\nrange of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,\nand split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,\naccelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated\nchips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile\npocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in\nrecent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map\ncontinuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the\nreconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as\npixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully\ndesigned neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and\nlighting effects.

In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two\nphases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic\nprediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly\ncollected features significantly improve prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u810f\u9aa4\u505c\u540e\u660f\u8ff7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u810f\u9aa4\u505c\u540e\u660f\u8ff7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9ICU\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Fine and Gray\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u57282278\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u82cf\u9192\u3001\u64a4\u9664\u751f\u547d\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7b49\u7ade\u4e89\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u6536\u96c6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts.

State-of-the-art\nmethods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally\nimportant. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on\nreaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,\nthe learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching.

In\nthis paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account\nfor mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced\npolicies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies\nemulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task\ndemonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets\n(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human\noversight.

In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation.

To this end, we propose a simple and effective\ntechnique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to\nmany federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise\nvia randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of\nclients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased\nprivacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect\nassignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms\nresults in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "RR-Cluster\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1/\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRR-Cluster\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002", "result": "RR-Cluster\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9690\u79c1/\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RR-Cluster\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\u3002"}}

Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but\ntypically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to\ndistinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe\nthat, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D\ntexture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling\nstronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing.

Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "VQAThinker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VQA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cdVQA\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4ec5\u9700\u5206\u6570\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027VQA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired\nneural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data\nprocessing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on\nvarious tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a\nsequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves\nperformance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature.

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks.

However, instruction-based editing,\nparticularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,\nhindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a\nunified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We\npropose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.\nThis offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models\nare more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better\nvideo editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and\naligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data\nsynthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data\nsynthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and\nbackgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,\nbackground changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of\naccurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE\non extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing\ntypes and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,\ncollage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative\ndrop in performance.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets.

Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods\nrely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated\ndatasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,\nlimiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent\nstudies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level\nannotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches\noften depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process\ninefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on\ndiffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and\nCIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data\ndistribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on\nlarge-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even\nunder limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding\nmechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between\nIML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead.

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions.

In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task.

The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps.

These experts are guided by a\ntemporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal\nconsistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach\nencourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by\nfocusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The\npredictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a\nmixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse\nanomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a\n91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on\nXD-Violence and MSAD datasets.

The underlying assumption for the\nsegmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be\nsummarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are\nsmooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is\na region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally\nproposed by Chan and Vese in \\cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image\ndata terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.\nGoldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \\cite{gold:bre} so\nthat their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman\nmethod to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation.

The method alternates between\nsupervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that\nleverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather\nthan generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that\ncombines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier\nwith temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling\nreliable label estimation for unlabeled data.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

Nevertheless,\ngenerative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input\nimage do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be\ninferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar\nrelighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images.
