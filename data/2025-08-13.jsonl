Successfully\nperforming these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying\nphysics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during\nexecution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high\ndegree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,\nwhich makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical\nworkarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,\nneither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true\nrobotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising\ntrajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching\nmodel abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including\nconstraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of\nmotion of the articulated rigid body model.

We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor\nmodels, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the\nlocalized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also\npresent experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of\nlarger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up."}

While existing feature\nprojection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this\nissue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our\nexploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to\nhandle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at\npreserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects\nfine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and\ncross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical\nglobal-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network\n(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical\nfeature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)\nmodule is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns\nto dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers\nand a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing\nhigh-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these\nmulti-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which\nflexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation\nfeatures, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."}

The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images.

Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens\nstructure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that\nour ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across\ndifferent deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method\nsurpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction\nin lens structure segmentation under U-Net.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at\nhttps://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED."}

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability\nunder strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under\nstricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.\nWhile ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle\nwith stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is\nformed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,\ncapturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor\nfor knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed\nperiodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task\nconsistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation\nmechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a\nresult, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining\npreviously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and\nplasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that\nour method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models\nacross various memory budgets."}
