Successfully\nperforming these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying\nphysics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during\nexecution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high\ndegree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,\nwhich makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical\nworkarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,\nneither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true\nrobotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising\ntrajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching\nmodel abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including\nconstraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of\nmotion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and\ncontrol methods is given, followed by implementation details including model\nabstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller.

To overcome\nthe communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication, has been extensively explored in the research community.\nAlthough researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model\nconvergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost\nalong with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance.

These devices, often powered by energy-efficient\nmicrocontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep\nlearning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation\nof IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

The proposed method is devised to achieve\nhigh-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.\nConcretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the\ncoarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction\nhorizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture\ndetailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized\nrefinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained\nspatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable\ninformation. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an\nonline learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and\npromptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage.

In this approach, each clause - a\nlogical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is\ndisqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict.

The proposed\nfuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory\nfootprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the\nIMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a\n50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine.

Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system\nand perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the\npossibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything\nanywhere.

Although DETR-based methods have\nrecently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still\nsuffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit\nsemantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework\nthat incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through\ntransformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is\n\\textbf{ACTOR} (\\textbf{A}ction-aware \\textbf{C}ross-modal\n\\textbf{T}ransf\\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly\nattends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant\nfeatures.

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction.

The inherently\nlow contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images\nseverely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.\nExisting methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical\ninterpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware\ndeformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages\nsynchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical\nprior to constrain the registration.

Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the\nperceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution\nscreen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that\nthe existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are\nlimited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding\ndynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed\nLIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different\ncompression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective\nopinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the\nvalue of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that\ndetect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.\nAmong these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)\nvideo quality evaluator which we call CBAND.

However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring\nthe recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form\ndescription. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases.

Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face.

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

However, existing methods, whether\ntraining-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining\nsubject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame\ninteraction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field\nmakes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the\nsubject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby\nhindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout\nconditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively\nfacilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens\nthe consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise\ncontrol over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.\nBuilding on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable\nStorytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout\nconditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout\nannotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1\nmillion 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300\nhours of cartoon videos.

To investigate this, we developed a\nrobust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by\nsystematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective\nprompt engineering techniques.

However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language.

To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.
