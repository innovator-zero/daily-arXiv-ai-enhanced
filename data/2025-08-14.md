TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于检测针对女性的仇恨内容，包括三个模块，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的仇恨内容较多，现有方法难以有效检测，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态框架，包含注意力模块、图特征重构模块和内容特征学习模块，结合文本和图像信息。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，宏F1平均提升10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效检测针对女性的仇恨内容，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升了不同架构和参数规模的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，而现有VLMs的性能不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段使用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强异常感知；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现从感知到解释的飞跃。

Result: 在7个VLMs上显著提升，平均准确率最高提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型超越GPT-4.1和Claude-Sonnet-4。

Conclusion: IAD-R1展示了在工业异常检测中的有效性和优越性，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [3] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新型的神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合了视觉语言模型和粒子滤波推理，显著提高了检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AR的普及，认知攻击通过操纵AR内容影响用户感知，现有方法在语义推理和可解释性上存在局限。

Method: CADAR融合多模态视觉语言输入，生成符号感知图，结合先验知识和时间相关性，利用粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 在扩展的AR认知攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确率提高了10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在AR认知攻击检测中展现出高效性和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [4] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将敏感视觉数据转换为隐私保护的文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护机制（如模糊或加密）不足，导致隐私与数据效用之间的权衡问题。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，优化文本生成以实现语义准确性和隐私保护。

Result: 在CFP-FP数据集上，RL-MoE将重放攻击成功率降至9.4%，同时生成比基线方法更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动了更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

### [5] [Synthetic Data Generation for Emotional Depth Faces: Optimizing Conditional DCGANs via Genetic Algorithms in the Latent Space and Stabilizing Training with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09188)
*Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi,S. Younes Mirinezhad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN和知识蒸馏的合成深度人脸生成框架，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提升多样性和质量，并在分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算中高质量、多样化深度面部数据集的缺乏问题。

Method: 使用优化的GAN和知识蒸馏（EMA教师模型）生成合成深度人脸，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提取多种特征进行分类。

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，分类准确率达94%和96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成和分类任务中均优于现有技术，为情感计算提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Δ-AttnMask的数据高效框架，通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码评估样本质量，仅需20%数据即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）需要多模态数据，但数据选择方法研究不足，现有方法难以同时满足规模和质量要求。

Method: 利用注意力掩码计算隐藏状态损失差异（Δ），联合评估图像-文本对质量，无需额外标签或训练。

Result: 在多个VLM和数据集上，仅用20%数据即可加速训练5倍，且总体准确率提升10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask是一种模型无关、数据无关的高效框架，适用于多模态和架构。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法通常不适用于仅含单一类别（中性表情）的目标数据，且图像生成方法不稳定且计算量大。

Method: 在潜在空间中预训练翻译器，通过优化表情一致性和风格感知目标，保留表情信息，并在中性目标数据上适应翻译器。

Result: PFT避免了面部表情生成的复杂性和噪声，生成优化的分类嵌入，无需图像合成，计算开销低。

Conclusion: PFT是一种高效的方法，适用于仅含中性表情的目标数据，提升了面部表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动漫行业中从草图生成全彩绘的高成本瓶颈问题。

Method: 评估了神经风格迁移、C-GAN和CycleGAN等模型。

Result: C-GAN能生成接近人类创作的高质量高分辨率图像。

Conclusion: C-GAN是解决动漫草图着色问题的最有效模型。

Abstract: The process of generating fully colorized drawings from sketches is a large,
usually costly bottleneck in the manga and anime industry. In this study, we
examine multiple models for image-to-image translation between anime characters
and their sketches, including Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN. By
assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most
effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images
close to those created by humans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MME-Emotion是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情感知觉和推理能力，包含6000多个视频片段和任务特定的问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感基准测试在MLLMs的泛化能力和情感触发因素推理能力方面存在不足，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出MME-Emotion基准测试，包含多样化的场景和任务，采用混合指标和多智能体系统框架进行评估。

Result: 评估20个先进MLLMs，发现其情感知觉能力不足，最佳模型识别分数仅为39.3%，推理分数为56.0%。

Conclusion: MME-Emotion可作为未来提升MLLMs情感知觉能力的基础工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

### [10] [Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09218)
*Zuoou Li,Weitong Zhang,Jingyuan Wang,Shuyuan Zhang,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz,Mengyun Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种四轴评估框架和递归重写策略BSD，用于更准确地评估和提升多模态大语言模型对抗提示的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估标准可能高估了对抗提示的成功率，许多被标记为成功的响应实际上是良性的、模糊的或与恶意目标无关。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入主题性、输入OOD强度、输出危害性、输出拒绝率），并开发递归重写策略BSD。

Result: BSD在13个商业和开源MLLM中表现优异，攻击成功率提高67%，危害性提升21%。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前多模态安全系统中未被充分认识的弱点，BSD策略显著提升了对抗提示的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手写数学表达式识别（HMER）领域数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据引擎，生成复杂且一致的LaTeX序列，构建Tex80M数据集，并通过混合训练Tex80M和小规模HME数据集训练TexTeller模型。

Result: TexTeller在几乎所有基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过大规模数据集和混合训练方法，显著提升了HMER性能，并公开模型、数据集和代码以推动领域发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDAGS提出了一种基于梯度方向感知的自适应密度控制框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过度重建和过度密集问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在复杂场景中存在过度重建和过度密集问题，导致内存开销增加和渲染质量下降。

Method: 通过梯度一致性比率（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，实现梯度方向感知的密度控制。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS通过优化高斯利用，有效解决了过度重建和过度密集问题，构建了紧凑的场景表示。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

TL;DR: FineState-Bench是首个用于评估GUI代理细粒度控制能力的标准，通过多平台任务基准和视觉诊断工具VDA，揭示了当前模型在细粒度交互上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理评估框架过于关注粗粒度任务完成，忽视了细粒度控制能力的重要性。

Method: 提出FineState-Bench框架，包含2257个任务基准和四阶段评估指标，并开发了VDA工具进行视觉定位能力分析。

Result: 实验显示，最先进模型在细粒度交互上的准确率仅为32.8%，理想视觉定位可提升性能14.9%。

Conclusion: 当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基础视觉定位能力，FineState-Bench为未来研究提供了开源基准和诊断工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对盲人和低视力用户在使用视觉助手时可能无意中泄露隐私的问题，现有方法过于粗糙，影响可用性。

Method: 结合细粒度分割和数据驱动的风险评分机制，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上测试，FiGPriv保留26%的图像内容，提升VLM响应能力11%，识别能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和功能性。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

*Dongwoo Kang,Akhil Perincherry,Zachary Coalson,Aiden Gabriel,Stefan Lee,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型输入自适应导航方法，通过三种算法提升视觉与语言导航模型的效率，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量时会导致性能显著下降，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入三种自适应算法：选择性处理全景视图、基于重要性的自适应阈值和缓存机制。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少超过2倍，性能未显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了模型效率，适用于计算资源有限的实际场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is
publicly available at

TL;DR: SegDAC是一种基于分割的视觉强化学习方法，通过结合SAM和YOLO-World实现对象中心分解和语义标注，显著提升了视觉泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习面临高维输入和噪声奖励的挑战，现有大感知模型与RL的集成效果不明确。

Method: SegDAC利用SAM进行对象中心分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，并采用新型Transformer架构动态学习关注哪些片段。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上表现优异，最难任务性能翻倍，样本效率匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分解和动态片段选择，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

TL;DR: Lung-DDPM+是一种改进的生成模型，用于高效生成高质量的肺部CT图像，显著提升了采样效率和临床适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺癌诊断中存在效率低和解剖学不精确的问题，限制了其临床应用。

Method: 提出Lung-DDPM+，一种基于结节语义布局的DDPM模型，通过肺部DPM-solver加速，专注于病灶区域。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上，Lung-DDPM+实现了8倍FLOPs减少、6.8倍GPU内存降低和14倍采样加速，同时保持样本质量。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛医学影像应用的潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Result: 在意大利手语的大规模MultiMeDaLIS数据集上实现了99.44%的测试准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成能够为复杂多模态手势识别任务提供鲁棒且准确的框架。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续手语识别面临签名者差异和未见句子结构的挑战，传统方法效果不佳。

Method: 使用签名者不变Conformer和多尺度融合Transformer分别处理签名者独立性和未见句子任务。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，Conformer和Transformer分别降低WER至13.07%和47.78%，在SignEval 2025挑战赛中表现优异。

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计显著提升性能，为后续研究奠定新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

TL;DR: IMA++数据集研究了皮肤病变分割中的标注者间差异，发现恶性病变与标注一致性显著相关，并利用多任务学习提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割存在标注者内和标注者间的差异，尤其是边界模糊的病变（如恶性皮肤病变），研究这些差异对分割性能的影响。

Method: 构建IMA++数据集，分析标注者、恶性程度、工具和技能对分割一致性的影响，并利用多任务学习将一致性作为软特征。

Result: 恶性病变与标注一致性显著相关（p<0.001），多任务学习使平衡准确率平均提升4.2%。

Conclusion: 标注一致性可作为临床特征提升分割模型性能，IMA++数据集为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式骨骼姿势和启发式跨身份调整，无法高效捕捉多粒度运动细节。X-UniMotion旨在通过隐式潜在表示解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种自监督端到端框架，联合学习运动编码器和潜在表示，结合DiT视频生成模型，并通过空间/颜色增强及合成3D渲染实现运动-身份解耦。

Result: 实验表明，X-UniMotion在运动保真度和身份保持方面优于现有方法，能生成高度表达的动画。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion通过隐式潜在表示和自监督学习，实现了高效且高保真的跨身份全身运动迁移。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Method: DenoDet V2通过设计的注意力架构在变换域解构和调制特征，利用振幅和相位信息的互补性进行互调。

Result: 在多个SAR数据集上表现优异，SARDet-100K数据集上比V1提升0.8%，模型复杂度减半。

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制和互调机制，实现了SAR目标检测的显著进步。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

Abstract: Drones operating in complex environments face a significant threat from thin
obstacles, such as steel wires and kite strings at the submillimeter level,
which are notoriously difficult for conventional sensors like RGB cameras,
LiDAR, and depth cameras to detect. This paper introduces SkyShield, an
event-driven, end-to-end framework designed for the perception of submillimeter
scale obstacles. Drawing upon the unique features that thin obstacles present
in the event stream, our method employs a lightweight U-Net architecture and an
innovative Dice-Contour Regularization Loss to ensure precise detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our event-based approach achieves mean F1
Score of 0.7088 with a low latency of 21.2 ms, making it ideal for deployment

Conclusion: 系统可行，适合家庭级公民科学鸟类监测。

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard
bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads
short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Method: 利用LLM推断的空间先验作为二维高斯场注入目标地图，将丰富的上下文知识蒸馏到流模型中。

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成流框架和LLM先验的结合，显著提升了对象导航任务的性能。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在天气扰动（如雨、雾）下性能显著下降，主要受限于对有限天气类别的依赖以及场景-天气特征解耦不足。

Method: 提出Training-free Weather Reasoning机制和动态门控多模态框架，通过文本嵌入自适应调整视觉特征权重，并结合跨模态目标优化。

Result: 在多样天气条件下，Recall@1提升显著，夜间条件下+13.37%，雾雪条件下+18.69%。

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态门控机制，有效解决了天气扰动下的地理定位问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Conclusion: 提出的信息优化框架能有效减少假阳性检测，并通过神经网络分割加速算法，适用于真实世界数据。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NeRF的新型测试时优化（TTO）方法，用于长期3D点跟踪，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长期点跟踪中难以保持运动一致性或仅限于2D运动，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用可逆神经辐射场（InvNeRF）架构参数化函数，结合多尺度HexPlanes和高效像素采样算法，实现2D和3D跟踪。

Result: 在2D点跟踪中，平均精度提升近50%；在3D点跟踪中首次超越前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术场景中表现出色，结合了可变形NeRF的优势，为点跟踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时建模动作语义和空间上下文，需填补这一空白。

Method: PaIR-Net包含CPAM、PGCS和IIM三个模块，分别处理接触相关身体部位识别、像素级接触分割和全局关系整合。

Result: PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，各模块有效性通过消融实验验证。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了动作语义与空间上下文联合建模问题，并提供了新数据集和高效框架。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT)方法，通过运动提示生成和组适配器优化大预训练模型，显著提升微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别因样本稀缺和模型难以捕捉细微面部动作而受限，需改进大预训练模型以适应此任务。

Method: 引入运动提示生成（运动放大和高斯标记化）和组适配器，优化模型对细微动作的捕捉能力。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上，MPT表现优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MPT为微表情识别提供了一种创新且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: TRACE框架通过将3D点建模为刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，无需人工标签即可建模复杂动态3D场景的运动物理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理模型或标签，难以学习复杂运动物理。TRACE旨在无需标签的情况下建模3D场景的几何、外观和物理信息。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，显式估计物理参数。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上表现优异，尤其在未来帧外推任务中。还能通过聚类物理参数轻松分割对象或部分。

Conclusion: TRACE无需标签即可建模复杂动态3D场景，性能优越且具有分割潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的检索增强超分辨率（RASR）方法，通过自动检索相关高分辨率参考图像，解决了传统RefSR依赖手动配对的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法依赖手动配对的参考图像，限制了实际应用。RASR旨在通过自动检索参考图像提升实用性和灵活性。

Method: 提出RASRNet，结合语义检索器和扩散生成器，从数据库中检索语义相关参考图像并生成高质量图像。

Result: 在RASR-Flickr30数据集上，RASRNet比SISR基线提升0.38 dB PSNR和-0.0131 LPIPS，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是缩小RefSR研究与实际应用差距的有前景方向。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，具有出色的泛化能力，能在未见数据集上单次前向传播重建表面。

Conclusion: RayletDF是一种高效且泛化能力强的3D表面重建方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Conclusion: HyperKD展示了知识蒸馏框架在高光谱遥感分析中的潜力，为地理空间应用提供了有效的基础模型迁移方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Result: 实验证明 Animate-X++ 在通用动画图像上的优越性和有效性，并引入 A2Bench 基准进行评估。

Conclusion: Animate-X++ 解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了动画的通用性和真实性。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉定位任务中表现出色，但其安全性问题，尤其是后门攻击，尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用文本条件U-Net将攻击目标的语义信息嵌入原始图像，并通过重构损失确保攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 在InternVL-2.5-8B上ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上表现良好。

Conclusion: IAG攻击方法具有鲁棒性和可迁移性，为视觉语言模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the

Conclusion: CitySeg通过多模态和分层策略显著提升了城市规模点云分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

TL;DR: FTNet是一种无需训练的少样本深度伪造检测方法，通过利用少量样本显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法在未知样本上表现不佳，但现实中这些样本仍可用于分析，因此应将其视为少样本任务。

Method: 提出FTNet，仅需一个伪造样本作为参考，无需训练或参数更新，通过比较测试样本与已知样本的相似性进行分类。

Result: 在29种生成模型的测试中，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新SoTA。

Conclusion: 利用失败样本可以显著提升少样本深度伪造检测性能，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态混合面部专家（MoFE）方法和LFA数据集，解决了视频生成中身份保持和大面部角度覆盖不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在大面部角度下难以保持身份一致性，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 引入MoFE动态整合三种专家特征，并开发了包含Face Constraints和Identity Consistency的数据处理流程。

Result: 在LFA基准测试中，方法在面部相似性、FID和CLIP语义对齐上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效提升了视频生成中身份保持和大面部角度处理能力。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

Result: 在多种图像生成器生成的AIIs上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过异常检测和无监督学习，实现了对未见生成模型的泛化检测。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

TL;DR: GazeLT是一种结合放射科医生视觉注意力的方法，用于改进长尾疾病分类，通过整合和解构视觉搜索过程的时间动态，显著提升了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射科医生的视觉注意力模式包含细粒度和粗粒度的疾病信息，且注意力随时间变化，这对改进深度学习框架的自动化图像解读至关重要。此外，专家不仅关注主要疾病模式，还会注意到次要或偶然发现（长尾类），这些信息对分类有帮助。

Method: GazeLT通过整合和解构视觉搜索过程的时间动态，利用放射科医生的眼动数据来改进长尾疾病分类。

Result: 在NIH-CXR-LT和MIMIC-CXR-LT数据集上，GazeLT比最佳长尾损失方法提升了4.1%，比基于视觉注意力的基线方法提升了21.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: GazeLT通过有效利用放射科医生的视觉注意力动态，显著提升了长尾疾病分类的性能，为自动化医学图像解读提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

TL;DR: SkySplat是一种自监督框架，通过将RPC模型集成到通用3DGS流程中，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因与RPC模型不兼容和泛化能力有限，无法有效处理稀疏卫星图像。

Method: 提出SkySplat框架，结合CSCM模块和多视角一致性策略，仅需RGB图像和相对高度监督。

Result: 在DFC19数据集上，MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，速度提升86倍。

Conclusion: SkySplat在稀疏卫星图像重建中表现出色，具有高效性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: Video-EM框架通过模拟人类情景记忆，解决了Video-LLMs在长视频理解中的关键帧冗余和时空关系缺失问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将长视频简化为静态关键帧匹配，忽略了时空关系和场景连续性，导致信息冗余和准确性下降。

Method: Video-EM将关键帧建模为时序事件，结合空间关系和动态时序，利用LLMs的链式思维迭代筛选最小但信息丰富的记忆子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，且使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆建模和高效推理，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义感知重建误差（SARE）的新方法，用于检测扩散模型生成的假图像，尤其在面对未见过的生成模型时表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法在面对未见过的生成模型时性能下降，因为它们依赖模型特定的伪影。假图像与描述文本的相似性高于真实图像，这一现象启发了新方法。

Method: 通过计算图像与其描述文本引导重建之间的语义差异（SARE），量化语义变化，作为检测特征。

Result: 在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准测试中，SARE方法表现出强大的泛化能力，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SARE方法通过捕捉假图像的语义特性，实现了对多样化生成模型的鲁棒检测。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖图表示和语言模型编码器，但忽略了关键的几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。

Result: CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现出色，实现了准确性与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何信息增强和动态半径策略，显著提升了分子对接的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在手语生成中表现出色，为未来研究提供了高质量数据集。

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

Conclusion: SOIBench可作为标准化评估平台推动语义认知跟踪研究，为跟踪领域提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Motivation: ViT的自注意力机制缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构化任务中表现不佳。现有方法使用固定距离度量的空间衰减，无法适应多样化的视觉场景。

Method: 提出了SDT，引入Context-Aware Gating (CAG)机制，动态生成数据依赖的空间衰减，结合空间邻近性和内容相关性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SDT为ViT的空间注意力增强提供了新范式，证明了数据依赖空间衰减的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合显著提升了压缩感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search

COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$

demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

Method: 提出IVF-AStereo网络，分两阶段：先通过聚合拼接体积优化相关体积，再融合两者以增强细节。

Result: 在非对称场景下表现优异，对分辨率和颜色退化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 实验证明该方法有效解决了非对称立体匹配问题。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

*Fengyi Wu,Yifei Dong,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Yilong Dai,Guangyu Chen,Hang Wang,Qi Dai,Alexander G. Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoViG是一种新任务，通过视觉预测和指令生成生成导航指令，仅依赖原始视觉数据，适应性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构化输入，GoViG仅用原始视觉数据，提升对未知和非结构化环境的适应性。

Method: 任务分解为视觉预测和指令生成，通过自回归多模态大语言模型整合，引入两种多模态推理策略。

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优异，BLEU-4和CIDEr分数显著提升，跨域泛化能力强。

Conclusion: GoViG在生成精确导航指令方面优于现有方法，适应性和泛化能力突出。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Motivation: 探索一种紧凑、可解释且高效的虹膜识别方法，以替代深度学习，适用于数据有限或需要解释性的场景。

Method: 将虹膜图像分块，计算每块的Betti0、Betti1及其比值，形成特征矩阵，结合逻辑回归等分类器进行识别。

Result: 逻辑回归准确率达97.78%，优于CNN（96.44%）和其他特征模型，且方差低。

Conclusion: 首次将数字同调理论用于虹膜识别，方法高效、可解释，适用于多种领域，尤其适合安全关键场景。

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多曝光校正方法在处理单一曝光图像时，难以应对光照、环境和天气等因素导致的类内变异性。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优于现有算法，验证了方法的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: WEC-DG方法在复杂成像条件下具有更好的适应性和性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成模型在临床效果和可解释性方面表现不佳，尤其是对病变属性的描述。

Result: 在两项基准测试中优于专家和通用模型，并展示了通过准确匹配问答诊断和图像的可解释性。

Conclusion: CoD框架显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和可解释性，为临床工作提供了高效支持。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控T2I模型在保留空间结构和捕捉细粒度条件（如物体姿态和场景布局）方面表现不佳。

Method: 通过外观反馈和生成反馈递归优化中间潜在表示，更好地反映外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，DRF能生成高质量、语义一致且结构一致的图像，支持跨类别的结构-外观融合。

Conclusion: DRF系统有效提升了可控T2I模型的性能，无需额外训练，适用于复杂场景生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is

Conclusion: SHALE为幻觉问题提供了细粒度评估工具，揭示了模型的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN 为 IDH 突变预测提供了一种更可靠且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上实现了高保真渲染，并首次支持实时外观编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head在重建质量和编辑灵活性上均表现出色，为头像建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

TL;DR: FaME是一种无需训练且高效推理的方法，通过识别低质量生成图像并利用其采样轨迹作为负引导，提升生成图像的感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类到图像生成中虽FID得分高，但常生成扭曲或低质量图像，尤其是某些类别。FID仅评估全局分布对齐，忽略个体样本的感知质量。

Method: FaME利用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成，存储其采样轨迹，作为负引导以避免未来采样进入低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，FaME在不影响FID的情况下，显著提升了视觉质量。

Conclusion: FaME是一种有效提升生成图像感知质量的方法，并有望扩展到文本到图像生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 纯相机方法在自动驾驶的BEV地图分割任务中表现不如LiDAR-Camera融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法通过模仿教师模型架构增加学生模型复杂度，导致推理成本上升。

Method: 引入轻量级教师助理网络，结合教师和学生的BEV表示，创建共享潜在空间作为中间表示，并使用Young不等式推导蒸馏损失。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BridgeTA比纯相机基线提高了4.2% mIoU，比其他最先进的KD方法提升高达45%。

Conclusion: BridgeTA通过教师助理网络和理论推导的蒸馏损失，有效提升了纯相机模型的性能，同时保持推理成本不变。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在稀疏视图CBCT中高效且可扩展，适用于临床。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Motivation: 现有高精度模型在手部几何与图像外观的对齐上仍不完美，纹理对齐可能是一个未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 设计了一个纹理模块，将像素观测嵌入UV纹理空间，并引入密集对齐损失，结合可微分渲染和已知拓扑的3D手部网格模型。

Conclusion: 纹理对齐可以作为有效的监督信号，显著提升手部重建的性能。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

TL;DR: Preacher是一个将论文转化为结构化视频摘要的代理系统，通过分解、总结和重构论文内容，生成高质量的视频摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型受限于上下文窗口、视频时长、风格多样性和领域知识表示不足，Preacher旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用自上而下的方法分解论文，结合自下而上的视频生成，使用渐进式思维链（P-CoT）进行迭代规划。

Result: 在五个研究领域成功生成了高质量的视频摘要，展示了超越现有模型的性能。

Conclusion: Preacher为论文到视频的转换提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,
well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models
demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid
video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to
represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce
Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

TL;DR: 提出了一种多对比融合模块（MCFM），用于提升胎儿躯干平面超声图像的识别性能，显著提高了分类准确性和临床可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像的低对比度和模糊纹理细节限制了胎儿解剖结构的精细识别，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 通过MCFM模块在神经网络底层处理原始超声数据，利用多对比注意力权重增强特征建模，同时保持低参数量。

Result: 在胎儿躯干平面数据集上验证，MCFM显著提升了识别性能，且模型复杂度增加极小。

Conclusion: MCFM通过多对比融合改善了特征表示，支持更准确和一致的临床诊断，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM模型依赖精确提示和忽略医学专家知识的局限性。

Method: 提出专家诊断报告引导的提示生成模块和跨序列注意力模块。

Result: 在三个独立临床中心验证了PG-SAM的先进性能和临床适用性。

Conclusion: PG-SAM通过结合专家知识，提升了真实临床环境中的分割效果。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Motivation: NLOS成像中信号弱且易受噪声影响，需结合物理过程确保准确重建。

Method: 采用噪声估计模块和参数化神经算子，通过深度算法展开构建重建框架，融合全局和局部时空数据特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在快速扫描和稀疏照明点数据中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的NLOS成像提供了可行解决方案，兼具高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有身份条件扩散模型在生成数据时缺乏类间分离机制的问题，导致身份重叠和性能下降。

Method: 在身份条件扩散过程中加入负条件，明确引导模型远离不需要的特征，同时保持类内一致性。

Result: Fisher判别比（FDR）从2.427提升至5.687，生成的数据显著提升了人脸识别系统的性能。

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件采样有效提升了生成数据的身份一致性和分离性，为人脸识别模型提供了更优的训练数据。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 稀疏视图3DGS重建因信息不足导致明显伪影，现有生成先验方法难以保持输入观测一致性。

Method: 提出基于DiT的视频扩散模型，结合参考视图的2D语义和3D几何特征修复伪影。

Result: GSFixer在3DGS伪影修复和稀疏视图重建中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSFixer通过多特征融合有效提升稀疏视图3DGS重建质量，并发布新评测数据集DL3DV-Res。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Conclusion: PaCo-FR推动了面部表示学习，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Conclusion: SAFF通过过滤无关特征，有效提升了小样本分类性能。

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma
geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过内部注意力机制隐式学习语义对应，提升了颜色一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: NEURAL在数据大小和临床效用之间取得了平衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Result: M3-Agent在M3-Bench-robot、M3-Bench-web和VideoMME-long基准测试中分别比基线模型高出6.7%、7.7%和5.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: M3-Agent在多模态代理的长期记忆和实际设计方面取得了进展，为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LDM和谐化方法在细节保留和和谐化能力上存在不足，且合成数据集缺乏局部变化和复杂光照条件。

Method: 设计了Clear-VAE和Harmony Controller（含MACA模块），并提出Random Poisson Blending生成多样化合成数据。

Conclusion: R2R方法有效提升了图像和谐化的细节保留与和谐化能力，新数据集进一步增强了模型的实用性。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合模态内和模态间专家的方法（MoIIE），用于提升大型视觉语言模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏混合专家（MoE）架构提高了参数效率，但在同时建模模态特定特征和跨模态关联方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 引入MoIIE，通过模态引导的路由机制，将令牌分配到模态内专家和共享的模态间专家池中，并结合两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在5.5B和11.3B激活参数下，MoIIE模型性能优于现有开源MoE-LLMs多模态模型。

Conclusion: MoIIE方法在效率、性能和通用性上表现出色，为多模态模型提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的形状匹配方法——组合匹配，用于几何形状装配中的互锁部件组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖表面形状对齐，而本文明确建模互锁形状的两个特性：相同表面形状和相反体积占据。

Method: 通过等变神经网络学习形状方向，建立表面形状相同但体积占据相反的对应关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少匹配中的局部模糊性，并优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 组合匹配方法在几何装配任务中表现出色，为互锁部件组合提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

TL;DR: DSS-Prompt利用静态和动态提示增强预训练视觉Transformer，在少样本类增量学习中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）中预训练模型适应性和灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 结合静态提示（适应预训练与下游任务差异）和动态提示（捕捉实例语义），利用多模态模型生成输入感知的动态提示。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt是一种简单有效的FSCIL方法，无需增量任务训练即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖卡尔曼滤波和刚性IoU关联，在复杂运动和遮挡情况下表现不佳，导致跟踪错误或目标丢失。

Method: 提出记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波（MeKF）补偿运动模型不匹配，以及运动自适应IoU（Mo-IoU）扩展匹配空间并引入高度相似性。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT数据集上，MeMoSORT分别达到67.9%和82.1%的HOTA分数，表现最优。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT通过创新设计解决了传统方法的局限性，在多目标跟踪任务中实现了高性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SISR方法在PBR材质超分辨率任务中存在跨图不一致性、模态特定特征建模不足和数据分布偏移导致的泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出MUJICA适配器，基于预训练的Swin-transformer SISR模型，通过跨图注意力机制融合特征，保持预训练模型的优秀重建能力。

Result: 在SwinIR、DRCT和HMANet等模型上，MUJICA提升了PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS分数，同时保持了跨图一致性。

Conclusion: MUJICA在有限资源下高效训练，并在PBR材质数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脑组织照片分割方法需要昂贵的人工干预，限制了其在大规模应用中的效率。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合1,414张手动标注的真实图像和2,000张合成的MRI图像进行训练。

Result: 模型在未见过的照片上表现优异，Dice分数中位数超过0.98，接近人工标注的一致性水平。

Conclusion: 该工具公开可用，为脑组织照片的自动分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉模型为动态偷猎热点监测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Conclusion: 揭示了学习机制中的权衡，为优化视觉语言模型的感知对齐和鲁棒性提供新见解。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有模型仅关注单一数据类型（运动或视频），无法全面捕捉人类行为的细微差别，因此需要结合两者。

Method: 提出ViMoNet框架，利用运动-文本数据（精确）和视频-文本数据（全面）的联合训练策略。

Result: ViMoNet在行为理解、动作描述和生成任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合多模态数据（视频和运动）能更全面地理解人类行为，ViMoNet为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Conclusion: PAR展示了通过自回归视频预训练转移世界知识在机器人操作中的潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Conclusion: 该工作为深度学习模型设计中的新算子开发提供了基础，并展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过建模视口间结构关系，显著提升了OIQA的性能，尤其在处理复杂空间失真时表现优异。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

TL;DR: ARI3D是一个用于交互式分析X射线CT图像中区域的软件工具，旨在改进相位识别、考虑部分体积效应、提高检测限和准确性，并统一不同科学领域的定量3D分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），使得用户需要基于体素灰度值做出许多决策来分割和分类微结构。ARI3D旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 开发了ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式协议辅助用户完成3D图像中区域的分类和量化步骤。

Result: ARI3D能够改进相位识别、考虑部分体积效应、提高检测限和准确性，并统一不同科学领域的定量3D分析。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像的定量分析提供了一种有效的交互式解决方案，适用于多科学领域。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Motivation: 探索ViT模型在图像识别任务中与人类感知的对齐情况。

Method: 系统分析模型大小、数据集大小、数据增强和正则化对ViT与人类感知对齐的影响。

Result: 大模型对齐度更低，数据增强和正则化会进一步降低对齐度。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，需在应用中权衡考虑。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

TL;DR: OneVAE是一种结合连续和离散视频VAE的方法，通过FSQ保留连续VAE的先验，提升训练速度和性能，并引入多令牌量化和首帧重建优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE存在训练不稳定、时间长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE训练更易且性能优越，因此希望通过结合两者提升离散VAE的性能。

Method: 利用FSQ保留连续VAE先验，提出多令牌量化机制和首帧重建优化，并设计联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: 训练速度提升数倍，PSNR提高近1 dB，4x16x16离散VAE性能显著改善，首次在单一网络中实现连续和离散表示的竞争性能。

Conclusion: OneVAE成功结合连续和离散VAE的优势，提升了离散视频VAE的训练效率和性能，为多模态LLM提供了更高效的视频编码方案。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在3D建模和细节保留上存在不足，且生成能力有限，导致几何不一致和场景不协调。

Method: 整合几何与生成建模，包括Reconstructor、Critique Agent、Pose Guider和Video Harmonizer四个代理。

Result: 在文本引导合成、视频重演和新姿势泛化等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HumanGenesis显著提升了表达性、几何保真度和场景整合能力。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COME的通用协作异构专家混合框架，用于解决超声图像分析中多数据集训练的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，由于数据有限、声学阴影和斑点噪声等问题。因此，构建一个适用于多异构超声数据集的通用框架至关重要。

Method: COME通过建立双结构-语义共享专家，创建通用表示空间，并与源特定专家协作，提取判别性特征。

Result: 在三种评估模式下（单数据集、器官内和器官间集成数据集），COME表现出色，显著提高了平均AP值。

Conclusion: COME通过利用跨数据集经验分布和提供通用超声先验，实现了对小批量或未见数据的鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Motivation: 传统RGB相机在光照不足、运动模糊和动态范围有限等方面存在局限性，而事件相机具有低功耗、高时间分辨率和高动态范围的优势，适合高速运动和低光场景的重建。

Method: 提出事件驱动的初始化方案、事件自适应切片泼溅、强度重要性剪枝和自适应对比度阈值优化，设计了多视角事件相机设置并提供了基准数据集。

Result: E-4DGS在事件相机和多模态基准测试中表现优异，为快速场景捕捉提供了新思路。

Conclusion: E-4DGS为多视角事件相机重建开辟了新途径，展示了在高速运动和低光场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Conclusion: 音频-视觉语音表示学习是检测伪造视频的有效方法。

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Method: 基于新构建的泛癌数据集（108,722个细胞核，13种细胞类型）训练HistoPLUS模型。

Result: 在4个独立队列的外部验证中，检测质量提升5.2%，分类F1分数提升23.7%，且参数减少5倍。

Conclusion: HistoPLUS显著提升了细胞分析的性能，支持更广泛的肿瘤微环境研究。

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not
present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell
analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei
covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model
weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用现成的Stable Diffusion模型进行视觉上下文学习（V-ICL）的方法，无需额外微调即可适应多种视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉上下文学习方法需要专门训练或额外数据，限制了其通用性。本文旨在探索如何利用现成模型实现高效的视觉上下文学习。

Method: 通过在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中重新计算注意力，显式地结合查询与示例提示之间的上下文关系。

Result: 该方法在六个视觉任务上表现优异，例如在Pascal-5i数据集上，前景分割任务的mIoU比现有方法提高了8.9%和3.2%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现成的Stable Diffusion模型可以通过简单的注意力重计算实现高效的视觉上下文学习，且能通过集成多提示进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

Motivation: 解决历史手稿数字化中HTR系统面临的挑战，尤其是在低资源转录设置下，HTG技术生成特定手写风格的合成数据以提升HTR性能。

Method: 比较三种HTG模型（生成对抗、扩散和自回归范式），分析合成数据的视觉和语言特征对微调结果的影响。

Result: 提供了关于HTG方法当前能力的见解，并指出了在低资源HTR应用中进一步改进的关键领域。

Conclusion: HTG模型在提升HTR性能方面具有潜力，但仍需在特定领域进行进一步优化和改进。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

Motivation: 低剂量CT减少辐射但增加噪声，影响诊断信心，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合高阶ODE求解器和条件模型，减少采样步骤。

Result: AST-25在25步内达到PSNR>38dB和SSIM>0.95，推理时间从16秒降至1秒。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶求解器在临床工作流中实现快速低剂量CT重建，保持图像质量。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Result: 生成的故事板在视觉多样性和一致性上优于现有基线，并通过用户研究验证了其动态性和叙事吸引力。

Conclusion: Story2Board在生成动态、连贯且叙事吸引人的故事板方面表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释性和可控性，为肖像动画和视频编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

### [119] [PERSONA: Personalized Whole-Body 3D Avatar with Pose-Driven Deformations from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09973)
*Geonhee Sim,Gyeongsik Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PERSONA结合3D和扩散模型方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决身份保持和姿态驱动变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在身份保持和姿态驱动变形上存在不足，PERSONA旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 利用扩散模型生成姿态丰富视频，通过平衡采样和几何加权优化优化3D化身。

Result: 实现了从单张图像生成高质量、身份保持的3D化身。

Conclusion: PERSONA为单图像3D化身生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Motivation: 现有VLM压缩方法存在模块不可比、评估场景单一和技术孤立的问题，LLMC+旨在填补这些空白。

Method: LLMC+提供多功能、即插即用的工具包，支持五种代表性VLM家族的20多种算法，系统研究令牌级和模型级压缩。

Result: 研究发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，令牌减少方法在多轮对话中表现不佳，联合压缩效果最佳。

Conclusion: LLMC+为高效VLM研究提供了公平评估平台，并启发了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决真实图像数据在罕见场景和文本-图像对齐方面的不足，利用合成数据的优势提升开源模型的性能。

Method: 通过GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调Bagel模型得到Echo-4o。同时提出GenEval++和Imagine-Bench两个新评估基准。

Result: Echo-4o在标准基准测试中表现优异，且Echo-4o-Image数据集在其他基础模型上也带来一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成图像数据能有效弥补真实数据的盲点，提升模型性能，且具有强迁移性。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

### [123] [Efficient Real-Time Aircraft ETA Prediction via Feature Tokenization Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09144)
*Liping Huang,Yicheng Zhang,Yifang Yin,Sheng Zhang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征标记化的Transformer模型，用于实时预测飞机到达时间（ETA），在准确性和效率上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时ETA预测对航空到达管理至关重要，尤其是在跑道排序中，需要高效率和准确性。

Method: 利用特征标记化将原始输入映射到潜在空间，结合Transformer的多头自注意力机制，减少复杂特征工程需求，并支持高频率并行计算。

Result: 在实验中，该方法比XGBoost准确率提高7%，计算时间仅需39%，且单次推理时间仅51.7微秒。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于实时到达管理系统。

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial
for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given
the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as
important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In
this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to
efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to
latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer
captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex
feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation
capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,
which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs
include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta
degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and
aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA
prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA
prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using
one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October
1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers
all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that
our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based
model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\%
of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40
aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only
51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management
systems.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态情感分析常因无关或误导性的视觉和听觉信息而表现不佳，现有方法通常将整个模态信息作为独立单元处理，容易丢失关键信息。

Method: MoLAN将每个模态的特征分块，根据噪声水平和语义相关性动态分配去噪强度，实现细粒度噪声抑制。

Result: 在五个模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，MoLAN框架广泛有效，MoLAN+达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MoLAN是一个统一且灵活的框架，可无缝集成到多种多模态模型中，显著提升了多模态情感分析的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions.
However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory
information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality
information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an
independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the
redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To
address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise
dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking
by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is
then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise
level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while
preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and
flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of
multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a
new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and
four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework.
Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art
performance. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二进制指数退避方案在动态信道环境下性能较差，且现有模型方法在节点密度估计不准确时仍导致吞吐量损失。

Method: 设计了基于transformer的ICL优化器，通过预收集碰撞阈值数据示例和查询碰撞案例，生成预测的竞争窗口阈值（CWT）。

Result: 实验证明该方法在未知节点密度下具有快速收敛和接近最优的吞吐量性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均优于现有模型和深度强化学习方法，且能容忍输入数据中的错误。

Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still
incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent
model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply
optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading
to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This
paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)
theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL
optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query
collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the
transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention
window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop
an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within
limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for
ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.
We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput
deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further
demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over
existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明，简单架构可能优于复杂序列混合器，因此探讨序列混合器在时间序列分析中是否必要。

Method: 提出JustDense方法，用密集层替换序列混合器，基于MatrixMixer框架进行理论分析。

Result: 在29个基准测试中，密集层替代序列混合器表现相当或更优，挑战了复杂架构必然更好的假设。

Conclusion: 复杂序列混合器在时间序列分析中并非必需，简单架构可能同样有效。

Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have
become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent
studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as
attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve
comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits
attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other
architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a
central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series
analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that
systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models
with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any
sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This
substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical
foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive
experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven
state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show
that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even
superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer
benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex
architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

Result: 理论证明和实验结果表明DIG2RSI优于现有方法，能准确估计同伴效应。

Conclusion: DIG2RSI有效解决了复杂网络中的同伴效应估计问题，适用于非线性高维关系。

Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as
social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between
peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved
confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback
but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer
effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning
framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an
instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback
and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and
high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to
disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the
simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct
valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on
these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the
unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network
augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as
a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no
residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in
capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances
the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and
hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard
regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.
Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset
demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

Result: 在8个基准测试和多种模型上显著提升了直接推理和自我评估能力。

Conclusion: AdaPO通过自适应机制有效解决了奖励黑客问题，为模型自我改进提供了新思路，代码将开源。

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own
output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve
self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation
models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward
hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model
collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning
framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time
according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to
mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a
Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's
training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn
trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty
with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between
different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly
adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual
intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show
that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and
self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the
community.

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to
enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems.
Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a
differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency
and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned
distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material
parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a
learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy.
The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside
plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed
inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our
method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE
constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges
generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for
simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical
systems.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶的决策框架存在轨迹生成与评估分离的问题，导致无法进行迭代优化，且强化学习方法将多维偏好压缩为标量奖励，掩盖了关键权衡。

Method: EvaDrive将轨迹规划建模为多轮对抗游戏，结合自回归意图建模和扩散模型生成候选路径，并通过可训练的多目标评估器进行严格评估。

Conclusion: EvaDrive通过动态权重生成多样化驾驶风格，无需外部偏好数据，为类人迭代决策提供了闭环对抗框架和标量无关的轨迹优化方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like
iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines
trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate
trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement
essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse
multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical
trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present
EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that
establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and
evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as
a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator
continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent
modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial
flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable
multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures
without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial
interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative
multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving
trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks
demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing
DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving
Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic
weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop
adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a
novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction
of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the
affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin
can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a
severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side
effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance
diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse
events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and
provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by
the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates
15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose
measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are
included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two
sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and
sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an
equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,
data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values
present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose
levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55
minutes before hypoglycemia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑能耗预测对资源管理和可持续性至关重要，但现有方法在历史数据不足或无数据时表现不佳。

Method: PgMN通过并行投影层处理不完整输入，记忆单元处理持续偏差，记忆经验模块优化预测范围。

Result: PgMN在多种场景（如新建建筑、数据缺失）中表现出高准确性和适用性。

Conclusion: PgMN为动态建筑环境中的能耗预测提供了有效解决方案，尤其在历史数据有限或物理模型不足时。

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource
management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are
highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable
when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings.
On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy
consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building
parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper
introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that
integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address
their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process
incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory
Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and
produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are
mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was
evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical
for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems.
Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse
scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical
data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising
solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments,
enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or
unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.

Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in
size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and
control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in
the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non
linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states.
Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly
important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable
operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus
on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further
identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition,
these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian
process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to
univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other
linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled
system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems,
additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and
explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised
explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized
windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e.,
detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity
during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was
benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1
with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI
framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals
being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better
accuracy.

Motivation: SC在资源受限场景（如IoT）中作为低功耗替代方案，但层间混合精度实现仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入ASL方案，基于算子范数理论模型分析截断噪声传播，并提出两种截断策略（粗粒度和细粒度）。

Result: 在32nm工艺下，ASL可降低60%以上的能耗和延迟，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ASL方案在IoT应用中可行，混合精度截断在SC设计中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative
for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the
Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC
significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional
floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise
mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article
introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies
mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an
operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise
can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification
factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest
(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the
alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To
accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two
truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse
sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP
synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency
overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the
feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct
advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic
yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in
agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze
intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the
primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents
represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes
describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the
joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of
dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and
produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from
available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute
combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the
sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of
falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in
the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion
model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying
joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of
numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros
minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population
synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range
of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and
diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and
diversity of the synthesized population.

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集和真实ECG数据上，AUROC达0.835和0.778，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PatchECG在不同ECG布局下表现稳定且优于现有方法，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by
different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and
partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To
address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive
variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking
training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with
collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of
arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the
PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit
tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated
strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged
with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data
from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached
0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to
various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current
optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and
0.19.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is widely used in front-end development and

However, turning creative ideas into precise vector graphics remains a

enhanced semantic guidance. Based on this dataset, we propose SVGen, an
end-to-end model that generates SVG code from natural language inputs. Our
approach ensures semantic accuracy and structural completeness, supported by
curriculum learning and reinforcement learning optimization. Experiments show
that SVGen outperforms general large models and traditional rendering methods
in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and dataset are available on

Result: 在两个基准多模态数据集上实验显示显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需训练，有效解决了模态间隙问题。

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of
queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address
challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with
pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large
multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a
misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common
embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is
typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive
domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight
training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend
across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently.
During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling
retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual
descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for
the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we
introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating
synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for
standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two
benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

Conclusion: FedMP有效提升了非独立同分布场景下的联邦学习性能，并分析了流形维度、通信效率和隐私影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which
multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their
local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter
challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed
(non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly
pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature
distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method
designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic
feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client
classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature
manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating
the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the
effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those
with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain
natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP
outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of
manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of
feature exposure in our method.

TL;DR: DQT是一种新型的动态量化训练框架，通过嵌套整数表示和整数运算，实现高效动态量化，无需解量化和重新量化，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态量化方法需要昂贵的解量化和重新量化操作，破坏了整数硬件范式并影响性能增益。

Method: DQT采用嵌套整数表示和自定义整数运算，通过低成本位移操作实现动态位宽切换。

Result: 在ImageNet上，4位动态ResNet50达到77.00% top-1准确率，优于静态和动态方法，且位宽转换成本极低。

Conclusion: DQT为高效自适应AI开辟了新前沿，显著降低了动态量化的计算成本。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies
on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width
to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,
instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.
However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly
dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,
breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.
This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework
that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer
representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within
higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only
arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost
bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable
both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and
truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight
controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate
DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on
ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1
accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,
76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this
with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a
drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a
new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

Conclusion: scAGC通过自适应图学习和对比指导，显著提升了单细胞数据的聚类效果。

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular
heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero
elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant
statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph
neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static
graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the
long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these
limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns
adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature
representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages
a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the
graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem
of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood
structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of
scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for
robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is
incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt
changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence.
Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI
and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at
Anonymous Github.

Result: 实验证明LCSFLA能有效缓解非独立同分布数据导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: LCSFLA通过激励机制和长期评估提升了联邦学习在非独立同分布数据下的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables
universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as
smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a
mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This
method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training
data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and
environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and
accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID
issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics
evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client
selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource
wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have
limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in
client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making
the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction
(LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term
data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised
auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation
and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive
compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism.
Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios,
demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by
non-IID data.

Conclusion: FGSN通过任务特异性多维异构安全神经元集群优化机制，实现了对未知安全问题的持续防御和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language
models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and
introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for
the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most
post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These
methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and
fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and
utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)
with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety
risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety
layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety
neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then
project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model
safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive
experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method
significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal
parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by
introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron
cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization

### [146] [From Values to Tokens: An LLM-Driven Framework for Context-aware Time Series Forecasting via Symbolic Discretization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09191)
*Xiaoyu Tao,Shilong Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Bokai Pan,Changqing Zhang,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenCast是一个基于LLM的框架，通过语言符号表示实现上下文感知的时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测在多个关键领域有重要应用，但现有方法难以整合历史数值序列和上下文特征（如非结构化文本数据）。

Method: 使用离散标记器将连续数值序列转换为时间标记，通过预训练LLM嵌入共享表示空间，并优化生成目标，最后微调LLM预测未来标记。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验证明了TokenCast的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TokenCast通过统一语义空间和LLM优化，显著提升了上下文感知时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making
across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and
finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to
the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual
features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this
challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages
language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for
context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a
discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal
tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the
semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are
embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language
model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.
Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently
fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are
then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on
diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

*Xu Wang,Chenkai Xu,Yijie Jin,Jiachun Jin,Hao Zhang,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为离散扩散强迫（D2F）的策略，通过结合自回归和扩散模型的优势，显著提升了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源dLLMs在推理速度上未能超越类似规模的自回归LLMs，因此需要一种新方法来突破这一限制。

Method: D2F通过块级自回归生成和跨块并行解码，将dLLMs改造为自回归-扩散混合范式，并结合非对称蒸馏和流水线并行解码算法。

Result: 实验表明，D2F dLLMs在GSM8K上的推理速度比LLaMA3和Qwen2.5快2.5倍以上，比LLaDA和Dream等vanilla dLLMs快50倍以上，同时保持输出质量。

Conclusion: D2F是一种简单有效的策略，显著提升了dLLMs的推理效率，为文本生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential
to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing
open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of
similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective
strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key
capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache
utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of
prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs
are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.
D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on
pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,
which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F
dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and
Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the
acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable
output quality. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有IPCGRL方法难以充分利用文本输入的丰富表达性，尤其是在复杂多目标指令下，导致可控性受限。

Method: 提出MIPCGRL，结合句子嵌入和多标签分类网络，训练多目标嵌入空间。

Result: 实验表明，MIPCGRL在多目标指令下的可控性提升了13.8%。

Conclusion: MIPCGRL能够处理复杂指令，实现更灵活和表达性更强的生成内容。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of
natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling
content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for
procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the
expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective
instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we
propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for
instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as
conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by
incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\%
improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability
to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content
generation.

Conclusion: 元学习框架为去中心化AI系统的推理加速提供了高效且自动化的选择方法，推动了更民主和经济的人工智能发展。

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs),
incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these
costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is
a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where
choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage
computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this
work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in
decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This
framework automates the selection process by learning from historical
performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition,
our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based
on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our
meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but
also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and
performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in
decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and
economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADT4Coupons的新营销框架，用于优化长期收入的优惠券分发策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优惠券分发策略未能有效利用平台与用户之间的复杂序列交互，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出ADT4Coupons框架，整合通用场景、序列建模和高效迭代更新。

Result: 在真实工业数据集、公共数据集和合成数据集上验证了框架的优越性。

Conclusion: ADT4Coupons能够优化多种现实营销场景中的在线决策，提升长期收入。

Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms
to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon
distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex
sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight,
despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance
plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make
sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with
each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing
scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision
Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution
policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online
decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves
this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios,
sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient
iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on
real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Abstract: Construction safety research is a critical field in civil engineering, aiming
to mitigate risks and prevent injuries through the analysis of site conditions

existing construction safety datasets pose significant challenges to conducting
in-depth analyses. To address this research gap, this paper introduces the
Construction Safety Dataset (CSDataset), a well-organized comprehensive
multi-level dataset that encompasses incidents, inspections, and violations
recorded sourced from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
This dataset uniquely integrates structured attributes with unstructured
narratives, facilitating a wide range of approaches driven by machine learning
and large language models. We also conduct a preliminary approach benchmarking
and various cross-level analyses using our dataset, offering insights to inform
and enhance future efforts in construction safety. For example, we found that
complaint-driven inspections were associated with a 17.3% reduction in the
likelihood of subsequent incidents. Our dataset and code are released at

Conclusion: MoQE通过专家模型的动态路由，有效提升了量化模型的性能，适用于CV和NLP任务。

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and
reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning
models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process
inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture
of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based
on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the
performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization
variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and
dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its
characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in
single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models.
We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and
NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families
across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText
demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization
model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Result: 实验显示，该方法在2000x2000阵列上减少了50%的转移步骤，规划时间低于2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为AR/VR和下一代显示器的微LED修复提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED
fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to
minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives
across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a
differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer
platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared
to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair
performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the
number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our
method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains
significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a
50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000
arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for
accelerating microLED repair in AR/VR and next-generation display fabrication.

Motivation: 标准方法依赖单维线性分类层，难以应对多样化和复杂的分布偏移。

Method: 提出分层自适应网络（Hi-Vec），包括动态层选择、权重合并机制和线性层一致性门控功能。

Result: Hi-Vec在多个目标数据集上表现出色，提高了鲁棒性并处理了不确定性和异常值。

Conclusion: Hi-Vec通过分层动态适应显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data
streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.
However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification
layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose
Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages
multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By
decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically
organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to
adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First,
we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal
layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that
merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers
receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts
as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy
batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging
scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to
advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves
robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and
increased outlier rates.

Conclusion: GSMT通过混合模型和任务校正器，有效提升了复杂城市交通环境下的公交车轨迹预测精度。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent
transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing
regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard
GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this
problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and
incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns
from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical
trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the
predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus
information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to
perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary
refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach
enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban
traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a
real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance
in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However,
effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is
still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype
estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to
generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task
and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can
build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further
enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or
finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype
estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt,
providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical
diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for
odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings
lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor
detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two
hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are
sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from
the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an
ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and
AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory
bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble
model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score
of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous
benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework
captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the
feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from
extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning
models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估图神经网络（GNNs）中过度压缩（over-squashing）问题的方法，并通过实验验证了重连（rewiring）策略在不同数据集上的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消息传递GNNs存在长距离信息过度压缩的问题，限制了其表达能力，但缺乏直接的评估指标。

Method: 提出了一种基于拓扑结构的方法，通过节点对的互敏感性衰减率评估过度压缩，并扩展到四种图级统计量。

Result: 实验表明，重连策略在图分类任务中有效缓解过度压缩，但在节点分类任务中效果有限甚至有害。

Conclusion: 重连策略在过度压缩严重且适度修正时最有效，过度使用或在不必要的情况下可能适得其反。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance
across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and
drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --
exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which
limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their
practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical
over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for
assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their
mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four
graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).
Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how
rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and
node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most
graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various
extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of
mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and
method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node
classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and
performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These
findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both
substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,
or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and
may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners
decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练时攻击或不现实场景，缺乏对部署后观察扰动漏洞的深入探讨。

Method: 在更现实和受限条件下（如仅能收集和扰动智能体观察），提出简单高效的对抗扰动算法。

Result: 在三个基准和22个环境中验证了算法的有效性，且样本效率高（仅需1,000样本）。

Conclusion: 揭示了c-MARL的新漏洞，为实际应用中的安全性提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly
evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications,
including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread
adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to
adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time
attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the
ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new
vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an
adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We
also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose
simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations
designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach
is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating
its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we
show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples
compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC
extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient
explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems
with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex
interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel,
explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:
recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific
programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward
this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative
patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code
representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern
implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form
pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods
informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge
Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning
trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over
traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education
by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying
granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student
learning.

### [162] [Distilling Reinforcement Learning into Single-Batch Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09283)
*Connor Wilhelm,Dan Ventura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 数据集蒸馏将大型数据集压缩为小型合成数据集，使得在合成数据集上的学习效果接近原始数据集。该方法可应用于不同任务，如将强化学习环境蒸馏为单批次监督学习数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索数据集蒸馏的通用性，特别是在不同学习模态（如强化学习到监督学习）之间的转换能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于近端策略优化的元学习扩展方法，用于蒸馏多维度经典问题（如cart-pole）、MuJoCo环境和Atari游戏。

Result: 展示了蒸馏方法能够将复杂RL环境压缩为单步监督学习任务，并验证了其在不同学习架构中的通用性。

Conclusion: 数据集蒸馏不仅能高效压缩数据，还能实现学习模态的转换，为跨领域学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic
dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on
the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little
as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is
generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning
environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not
only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also
its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into
another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy
optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a
multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo
environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to
compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL
distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate
distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture,
and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are
increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and
susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we
propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated
Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model
training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy
and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures
transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance
the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that
assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the
Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy
but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable
candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种精确验证方法GNNev，用于计算图神经网络（GNNs）在节点分类任务中对属性及结构扰动的鲁棒性保证，支持多种聚合函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在高风险应用中易受对抗攻击，现有技术对常用聚合函数的支持不足。

Method: 采用约束求解与边界收紧技术，迭代解决松弛约束满足问题，支持sum、max和mean聚合函数。

Result: 在标准基准数据集和真实欺诈数据集上验证了GNNev的有效性和优越性能。

Conclusion: GNNev首次支持max和mean聚合函数，并在性能上优于现有工具。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to
adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide
adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation
functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop
an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute
guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge
addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node
classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound
tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint
satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of
solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for
message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,
sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.
Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and
CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its
usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to
existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于权重大小的突触修剪方法，替代传统的随机失活神经元，通过逐步移除低重要性连接提升模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑通过突触修剪优化连接效率，而人工神经网络中的随机失活方法未考虑活动依赖性修剪，因此提出更接近生物机制的修剪方法。

Method: 在训练过程中逐步移除低重要性连接，采用立方调度增加全局稀疏性，定期应用修剪掩码永久移除低重要性权重，同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测模型（RNN、LSTM、Patch Time Series Transformer）和四个数据集上表现优异，显著降低平均绝对误差（金融预测中最高降低20%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态修剪机制提升正则化效果，易于集成到不同架构中，尤其在金融时间序列预测中表现突出，是传统失活技术的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve
efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks
randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We
propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology
by progressively removing low-importance connections during training.
Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our
approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and
applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed
intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while
maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate
pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting
models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four
datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with
statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).
In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over
models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.
This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight
elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into
diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time
series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to
conventional dropout techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统金融推荐系统缺乏对动态交互和局部压力的量化分析，RicciFlowRec旨在填补这一空白。

Conclusion: RicciFlowRec是首个将几何流推理应用于金融决策支持的推荐系统，未来计划扩展至投资组合优化和收益预测。

Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs
root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial
graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic
indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature
and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal
substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary
results on S\&P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness
and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports
curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for
portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec
is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial
decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出通过限制稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的训练领域（如医学文本），可以提升特征重建的准确性和可解释性，减少线性残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAEs在广泛数据分布上训练，导致固定潜在预算只能捕捉高频通用模式，产生线性“暗物质”残差和难以解释的潜在特征。

Method: 在Gemma-2模型的第20层激活上，使用195k临床问答数据训练JumpReLU SAEs，限制训练领域为医学文本。

Result: 领域限制的SAEs解释了更多方差（高达20%），提高了损失恢复，减少了线性残差，且特征与临床概念对齐。

Conclusion: 领域限制缓解了广泛领域SAEs的局限性，支持更完整和可解释的潜在分解，质疑通用SAEs的“基础模型”扩展需求。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations
into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train
on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only
high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear
``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or
absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE
training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to
domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and
interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2
models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs
explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce
linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human
evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful
concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather
than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture
relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.
We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain
SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and
suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for
general-purpose SAEs.

Result: 仅通过生成图像即可实现75%的痴呆检测准确率。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在病理语音对齐方面具有潜力，且可通过生成图像辅助痴呆检测。

Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural
language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images
online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and
generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand
whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated
images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align
dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop
methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia
detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the
ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of
the language contribute to the detection.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative
modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk
assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the
method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple
institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism
and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed
optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The
model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection
before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to
generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk
identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple
experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model
accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods
and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It
demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive
financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk
identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and
efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Result: 在真实云监控数据上表现优于现有模型，能更好地捕捉异常传播路径和动态行为序列。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督条件下表现出色，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed
backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex
structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of
labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation
relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural
representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the
temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local
fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding
mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified
anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores,
enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on
real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different
graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics,
demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly
propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential
for practical deployment.

Conclusion: IHGNN为高阶关系学习提供了稳定、高效且泛化能力强的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as
papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items.
Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order
relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing
layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as
depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks
(IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs:
instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a
nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global
propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a
well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing
conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive
generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient
training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy.
Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently
outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in
both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random
initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong
generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

Conclusion: NEXICA在准确性和计算速度上优于现有方法，有效识别拥堵源头。

Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the
causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing
slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the
highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use
time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding
other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three
ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the
time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic
slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood
estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns
between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to
identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations
where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both
positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data
from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that
our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
computation speed.

Result: 在六个数据集上验证，F1分数分别比SimCLR和MAE提升59.2%和14.27%。

Conclusion: 混合目标保持判别力并获得生成鲁棒性，为时间域混合自监督学习奠定基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes
two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and
generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective
individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a
Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to
unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT
addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive
learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while
reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT
on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements,
with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE,
respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves
discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings
establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the
code shortly.

Conclusion: FGCRN模型在多模式过程中有效识别未知故障，具有优越性能。

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known
health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode
processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple
cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate
decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set
fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network
(FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution,
bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture
discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance
the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are
constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures
of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance
between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations,
enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GraB-NAS通过混合搜索策略实现了高性能的任务感知架构发现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of high-performing
neural networks but typically targets a single predefined task, thereby
restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural
Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that
leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones.
Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor
generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this
paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS
first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy
is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural
architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via
Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel
neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search
strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong
performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines,
achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across
smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously
generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in
industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor
metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies,
inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time
series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart
systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model,
DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with
non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from
large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse
learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor
data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's
effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized

Result: 实验表明EGGS-PTP在加速、内存节省和准确性上优于现有结构化剪枝技术。

Conclusion: EGGS-PTP为LLMs的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more widely adopted and scale up in
size, the computational and memory challenges involved in deploying these
massive foundation models have grown increasingly severe. This underscores the
urgent need to develop more efficient model variants. Faced with this
challenge, the present work introduces EGGS-PTP: an Expander-Graph Guided
Structured Post-training Pruning method. The proposed approach leverages graph
theory to guide the design of N:M structured pruning, effectively reducing
model size and computational demands. By incorporating concepts from expander
graphs, EGGS-PTP ensures information flow within the pruned network, preserving
essential model functionality. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that
EGGS-PTP not only achieves significant acceleration and memory savings due to
structured sparsity but also outperforms existing structured pruning techniques
in terms of accuracy across various LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，NeuronTune在安全性和实用性上均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: NeuronTune为LLMs的安全部署提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the
reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient
robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries,
degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former
two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility
impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise
interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a
fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve
simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via
attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron
activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune
enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds,
supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority
scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving
superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

Result: 实验证明该方法在异构小型模型下仍表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了基础模型在联邦持续学习中的适应性和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet
underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL),
where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data
and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities,
FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are
unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new
tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem,
primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In
contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained
conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap
between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in
FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually
adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel
components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for
preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation
performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients
utilize heterogeneous small models.

Conclusion: MiCo框架为边缘AI应用提供了高效的混合精度量化解决方案。

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven
promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further
reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision
quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for
exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending
the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and
quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods.
Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ
models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and
deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel
optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the
highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency
models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.
After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ
models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal
accuracy drops.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAD是一种基于因果图的异常检测框架，用于公共基础设施系统中的网络攻击检测，通过因果分析和图比较提高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多变量时间序列中的分布偏移和类别不平衡时表现不佳，导致高误报率。

Method: CGAD采用两阶段监督框架：因果分析和异常评分，利用动态贝叶斯网络学习因果图结构，并通过图比较检测异常。

Result: CGAD在非平稳和不平衡时间序列环境中表现出更高的适应性和准确性，显著提升了F1和ROC-AUC分数。

Conclusion: CGAD通过揭示因果结构，不仅提高了检测精度，还重新定义了异常检测的鲁棒性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical
infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for
robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system
vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods --
statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution
shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high
false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal
Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack
detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised
framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal
invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal"
and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs
structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by
evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging
causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in
non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional
machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile
sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher
precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving
resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our
framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over
best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust
detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Result: 实验表明，Gauss-Tin在保留指标上比传统方法提高了6%。

Conclusion: Gauss-Tin是一种有效的混合模型策略，能够增强LLMs在动态学习环境中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs),
catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose
previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning
(CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with
replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving
learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach
that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance
the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional
guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to
improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important
past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results
indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional
methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating
catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid
models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning
environments.

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优异，无需针对数据集调整即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为PBPM中的下一事件预测提供了鲁棒、通用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events
in ongoing cases based on historical event logs. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data,
existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short
prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and
transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that
advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare
prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention
Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global
modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that
constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally
relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type
semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally
ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability
modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on
five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL
scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and
semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable
solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在延迟减少24%的同时，平均准确率提高2.5%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架在车联网场景中实现了最佳精度-效率权衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting
foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency
multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility,
heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a
hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units
(RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning
across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we
introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as
a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is
developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets,
achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a
large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic
participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency
trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving
average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training
effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic
Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for
rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic
data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph
constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies
candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM).
The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically
analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts
the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and
MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels,
outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.
This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for
realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

Motivation: 现有选择性预测模型允许预测者在任意时间开始预测，但实际中预测者可能只能在部分时间窗口内预测，因此需要研究有限选择性下的预测误差。

Method: 引入PLS模型，通过实例分析和平均案例分析研究最优预测误差，提出复杂性度量方法。

Result: 提出的复杂性度量能提供实例依赖的最优误差界限，且在随机生成的PLS实例中高概率匹配。

Conclusion: PLS模型扩展了选择性预测的适用性，复杂性度量为实例依赖的预测误差提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster
freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data
statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any
distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the
forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with
Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on
a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an
instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a
complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error.
For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high
probability.

Result: 实验结果表明，具有高因果容量的状态与预期的子目标一致，GDCC框架在多项任务中显著提高了成功率。

Conclusion: GDCC框架通过因果容量的测量和关键点的识别，有效提升了智能体在复杂环境中的探索效率。

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be
modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in
reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the
causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason
how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed
exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its
intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework
for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a
measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which
represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.
After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points
in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous
high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where
the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded
as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and
efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that
states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC
achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately
remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for
problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a
Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator
($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and
time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently
developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits
the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a
simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the
proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for
enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent
problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that
combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired
stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the
physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and
complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent
and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed
neural operator algorithms in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型忽略变量名称和描述中的语义信息，而这些信息对建模至关重要。TimeMKG旨在利用这些语义信息提升建模效果。

Method: TimeMKG使用大语言模型解析变量语义，构建多变量知识图谱，并通过双模态编码器分别建模语义提示和历史统计模式，最后通过跨模态注意力融合。

Result: 实验表明，引入变量级知识显著提升了预测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TimeMKG通过结合语义和统计信息，为时间序列建模提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities:
variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series
models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich
semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However,
these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is
essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a
multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from
low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs
large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured
Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A
dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from
knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time
series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the
variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as
forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to
guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that
incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive
performance and generalization.

TL;DR: Thermal Tracks是一个基于Python的统计框架，用于分析蛋白质热稳定性数据，克服了现有热蛋白质组分析（TPP）方法的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TPP方法假设蛋白质熔解曲线为S形，并受限于经验零分布，导致仅能检测约5%的数据。Thermal Tracks旨在解决这些问题，提供更灵活和准确的统计方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程（GP）模型和平方指数核，灵活建模任意熔解曲线形状，并通过核先验生成无偏零分布。

Result: Thermal Tracks能够更全面地分析蛋白质热稳定性变化，尤其适用于非传统熔解曲线的蛋白质（如相分离蛋白和膜蛋白）。

Conclusion: Thermal Tracks是一个开源、灵活的Python工具，适用于蛋白质组范围内的热稳定性研究。

Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein
thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal
proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume
sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions
(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses
Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model
any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through
kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing
proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,
such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,
where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to
their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing
proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating
proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal
thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and
is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for
proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem,
which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem
with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient
descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate
regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence.
However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow
both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient
descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By
introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla
gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence
rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing
regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the
implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show
that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable
completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于算子理论的框架，用于在嵌入空间中进行时间锚定，通过漂移映射和事件索引块的组合实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决嵌入空间中时间锚定的问题，并提供一个统一的数学框架。

Method: 使用漂移映射和事件索引块的组合，结合仿射投影，并提供了完整的数学证明。

Result: 证明了变量块收缩引理、漂移-投影收敛定理，并提出了内部手稿计算机（MC）的严格等价性定理。

Conclusion: 该框架为时间锚定提供了理论基础，并在注意力层中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in
embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks
culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a
variable-block contraction lemma (products of Lipschitz factors), a
drift--projection convergence theorem with explicit uniform-gap envelopes, and
ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant.
We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are
defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence
theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a
self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive
sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All
floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper
pseudocode and appendix figures.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，首次验证KANs在噪声标签分类中的优越性。

Conclusion: DCM机制有效提升模型对噪声标签的鲁棒性，KANs在真实噪声场景中表现优于MLPs。

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong
capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy
labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on
mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust
loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of
regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization
used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection
Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and
KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The
mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by
evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis,
we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more
robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection
strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the
first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their
superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code
will soon be publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GraphTreeGen（GTG）的子树中心生成框架，用于高效、准确地合成脑连接组，解决了现有模型在局部结构、节点属性、边权重预测和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑连接组对理解大脑组织至关重要，但获取成本高且耗时，因此需要生成方法。现有模型在局部结构、节点属性、边权重预测和计算效率方面存在不足。

Method: GTG将连接组分解为熵引导的k跳子树，通过共享GCN编码局部结构，利用二分消息传递层融合子树嵌入和全局节点特征，并通过双分支解码器联合预测边存在和权重。

Result: GTG在自监督任务中优于现有基线，在监督任务中表现竞争力，具有更高的结构保真度和更精确的权重预测，且内存需求更低。

Conclusion: GTG是一种高效、准确的脑连接组生成方法，其模块化设计支持扩展到超分辨率和跨模态合成。

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial
for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire,
motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling
offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and
reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models
face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code
(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node
attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;
(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight
prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive
designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,
limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric
generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG
decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing
informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite
message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while
a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to
reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings,
delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less
memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution
and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

Motivation: 现有AI工具在标记临床数据时缺乏可解释性，且概念瓶颈模型在概念不足以解释任务时性能受限。

Result: 方法在ARDS识别任务中性能提升10%，并生成更全面的概念。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和CBM的方法不仅提升了性能，还增强了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource
for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of
therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for
research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical
labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these
datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often
suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain
predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable
concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human
evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when
the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the
identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging
test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from
clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large
Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional
concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods.
Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts,
thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious
shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Motivation: 现有方法无法高效评估创意组合，GenCO旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 两阶段架构：生成模型生成创意组合，强化学习优化；多实例学习模型分配组合级奖励。

Result: 显著增加广告收入，并发布工业数据集。

Conclusion: GenCO在电商广告中具有实际价值，为后续研究提供数据支持。

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of
creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for
capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods
often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the
exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative
modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage
architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse
set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with
reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine
its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a
multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as
clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to
provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative
model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading
e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising
revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a
large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important
domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT)的方法，通过模块化和选择性特征转移优化小型可部署模型，性能优于传统蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度模型在性能和效率之间的权衡问题，通过生物启发的知识继承机制提升小型模型的能力。

Method: HKT框架包含Extraction、Transfer、Mixture (ETM)三个阶段，采用Genetic Attention机制选择性整合特征。

Result: 在多种视觉任务（如光流、图像分类、语义分割）中，HKT显著提升小型模型性能且保持紧凑性。

Conclusion: HKT为资源受限环境提供了一种通用、可解释且可扩展的高性能神经网络部署方案。

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance
improves with increasing depth and capacity - often at the cost of
integrability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize
small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured
knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a
biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of
task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller
child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform
imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance
mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage
process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional
carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated
components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention
(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,
ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision
tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),
and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves
child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that
HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a
general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying
high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 开发了一种机器学习流程，通过动态生物标志物预测年龄，显著优于静态模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测个体衰老轨迹是预防医学和生物信息学的核心挑战，现有模型难以捕捉衰老的动态过程。

Method: 利用纵向队列数据，设计捕捉生物标志物变化率的新特征，使用LightGBM模型。

Result: 模型在预测未来时间点年龄时表现优异（男性R²=0.515，女性R²=0.498），优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 动态健康轨迹是生物年龄的关键决定因素，该框架为临床工具开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in
preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can
predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the
dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed
and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal
cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We
demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has
limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by
engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)
of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our
final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully
predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for
males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional
linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful
model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important
predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their
static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework
paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health
trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention
strategies for age-related diseases.

these two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a
$\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for
feature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We
empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling
the number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.

Conclusion: TriForecaster展示了在多区域电力负荷预测中的灵活性和广泛适用性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and
decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed
and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus
and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a
province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric
Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load
forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three
challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and
temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework
leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer
and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic
cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual,
and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets
with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by
achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating
its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of
TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its
practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts
for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily
electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST上分别达到97.8%和89.3%的测试准确率，训练时间仅3.9-4.5秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、速度和模型大小之间取得了优越的权衡，优于ELM、随机特征岭回归和浅层MLP。

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form
weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic
inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we
recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more)
ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes
with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space
to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k
train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the
official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k
trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a
multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable
ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the
condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields
favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge,
and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating
athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and
evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human
body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the
relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With
advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods
have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we
leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical
features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.
The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features
contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of
these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship
between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective
distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the
model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial
Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The
findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,
specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the
angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key
factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater
than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for
female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the
most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.
This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features
on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

Result: 理论证明了0-1损失的收敛性，并展示了模型在概念重组和分布变化下的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在事实召回任务中的优势，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability
to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the
presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al.
(2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for
Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks.
Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of
Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these
insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward,
we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded
hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how
nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy
loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss
convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept
recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages
of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations
corroborate our theoretical insights.

Motivation: 现有的成对偏好学习框架（如RankNet）局限于局部比较，难以捕捉全局排名一致性。

Method: 提出RankList框架，结合列表级监督和概率建模，引入log-sum-exp近似以提高训练效率，并扩展了跳步比较以增强全局排名保真度。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（MSP-Podcast、IEMOCAP等）上，RankList在Kendall's Tau和排名准确性上优于基线方法，并在跨域任务中表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RankList为建模主观学习场景中的有序偏好提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving
subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and
image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer
robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local
comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address
these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning
framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our
formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a
probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to
improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise
comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and
enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets
(MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements
in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines.
We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic
Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through
ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves
in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework
offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in
subjective learning scenarios.

Motivation: 当前联邦遗忘研究主要关注效率和有效性，而忽略了去中心化客户端在遗忘过程中的公平性问题。

Method: 提出FedShard算法，自适应解决收敛、遗忘效率和公平性之间的困境，并引入两个新指标量化公平性。

Result: FedShard在遗忘性能和效率上均表现出公平性，遗忘速度比从头训练快1.3-6.2倍，比现有方法快4.9倍。

Conclusion: FedShard有效解决了联邦遗忘中的公平性问题，并显著提升了效率。

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated
unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the
global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing
unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency
fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning
have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the
first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both
efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the
challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and
unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to
quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to
satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in
terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that
FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning
attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效的蒸馏框架（DED），通过优化推理蒸馏的帕累托前沿，仅需少量精选数据即可实现先进的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: DED框架结合强化学习的策略学习和多样化轨迹生成，通过选择最优教师模型、精选小规模语料库和多样化推理轨迹，实现高效蒸馏。

Conclusion: DED提供了一种高效且实用的方法，不仅提升了推理能力，还保留了模型的通用能力，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in
tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent
methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training
combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some
methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via
only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing
computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation
framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.
Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of
reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We
identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher
model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop
a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can
enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully
curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and
out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the
student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method
through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and
code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only
0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our
systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by
considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model
capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced
reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

TL;DR: 现代人工神经网络（ANN）在土壤预测建模中超越传统方法，TabPFN表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证现代ANN在土壤预测建模中的适用性，挑战传统方法的长期主导地位。

Method: 通过31个数据集评估多种ANN架构，包括MLP、Transformer和TabPFN等。

Result: 现代ANN在多数任务中优于传统方法，TabPFN表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 推荐现代ANN作为土壤预测建模的新标准，TabPFN为首选工具。

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant
method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing
data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale,
this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small
training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.
Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep
learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly
tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least
Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.
Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge
this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN
architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models
(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,
ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,
ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our
evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460
samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic
carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently
outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep
learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of
classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest
overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore
recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as
the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

Motivation: 异常检测中确认异常存在的基本问题尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过超过三百万次统计测试，分析数据集大小、污染率和算法常数之间的关系。

Result: 发现样本数N需满足N ≥ α_algo/ν²才能确认异常存在，揭示了异常稀有性的极限。

Conclusion: 研究为异常检测提供了理论下限，表明异常过于稀有时难以证明其存在。

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for
effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in
anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that
addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that
anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three
million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and
algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination
rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results
demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate
$ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents
a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.
This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving
their existence becomes infeasible.

Motivation: 现有方法仅通过简单提示利用LLMs进行上下文辅助预测，未充分挖掘其潜力。

Method: 四种策略分别关注解释性（ReDP）、预测修正（CorDP）、历史示例嵌入（IC-DP）和资源优化（RouteDP）。

Result: 在CiK基准测试中，这些策略在不同规模和家族的LLMs上均优于简单提示方法。

Conclusion: 这些简单而有效的策略为LLM在上下文辅助预测中的进一步改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only
historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in
textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can
be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full
potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,
providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.
ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing
us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its
forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts
with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting
pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided
forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the
largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to
estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger
models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from
the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive
prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the
door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided
forecasting.

Motivation: 扩散模型在高质量图像生成中表现出色，但计算成本高，尤其是迭代去噪过程。现有方法如RDM依赖外部存储和检索基础设施，成本高且缺乏适应性。

Method: PDM通过对比学习从干净图像特征构建动态紧凑视觉原型，这些原型通过语义相关视觉模式引导去噪步骤。

Result: 实验表明PDM在减少计算和存储开销的同时保持高生成质量。

Conclusion: PDM为扩散模型提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，避免了检索条件化的缺点。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image
generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse
domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during
the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion
alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though
at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as
Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning
denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While
effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and
retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for
similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype
Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly
into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -
without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM
constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features
using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by
aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,
enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show
that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and
storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based
conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear
stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal
residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on

Conclusion: 该方法在保持基础模型保真度的同时，显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in
Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision
models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to
effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of
this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in
computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.
Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve
its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose
one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge
into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided
test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that
modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework
for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through
a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model
while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach
recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time
optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. Code is available at

Method: 提出动态混合专家（DyMoE）方法，添加新专家网络并设计定制正则化损失，同时引入稀疏MoE以减少计算成本。

Result: 模型在类增量学习任务中相对基线模型提升了4.92%的准确率。

Conclusion: DyMoE方法有效解决了图增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained
models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need
for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning
methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental
learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new
knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the
previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to
maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,
do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different
timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns
can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the
new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic
mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a
DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming
data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data
sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve
old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the
number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a
sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make
predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved
4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class
incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.

Abstract: One of the most critical features for the successful operation of autonomous
UAVs is the ability to make decisions based on the information acquired from
their surroundings. Each UAV must be able to make decisions during the flight
in order to deal with uncertainties in its system and the environment, and to
further act upon the information being received. Such decisions influence the
future behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,
decision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying
autonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of
existing studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,
presenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative
Path Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled
and understood. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges for relevant

Abstract: Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical
challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and
distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited
in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while
model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction
in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition
model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of
world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to
forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the
probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic
and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to
quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from
high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator
can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding
prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to
miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised
domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution
shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides
theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across
long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that
our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower
false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based
composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon
tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.

Conclusion: CLF-RL框架显著提升了双足机器人运动策略的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in generating robust locomotion
policies for bipedal robots, but often suffers from tedious reward design and
sensitivity to poorly shaped objectives. In this work, we propose a structured
reward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and
control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning. We explore two
model-based planners for generating reference trajectories: a reduced-order
linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for velocity-conditioned motion planning,
and a precomputed gait library based on hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) using
full-order dynamics. These planners define desired end-effector and joint
trajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize
tracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides
meaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a
reference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are
used only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We
validate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world
experiments on a Unitree G1 robot. CLF-RL demonstrates significantly improved
robustness relative to the baseline RL policy and better performance than a
classic tracking reward RL formulation.

Conclusion: DifNav通过端到端优化和扩散策略，解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了导航性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.
Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning
framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable
waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the
high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework
suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each
stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the
quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,
we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE
policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and
planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional
diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future
actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint
predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible
instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in
imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation
tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory
augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This
approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to
recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method
substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based
models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中表现优异，轮廓误差和加速度低，计算速度比现有方法快10倍。

Conclusion: RMPCC框架在动态环境中高效且稳定，适用于实时机器人路径跟踪。

Abstract: This contribution presents a robot path-following framework via Reactive
Model Predictive Contouring Control (RMPCC) that successfully avoids obstacles,
singularities and self-collisions in dynamic environments at 100 Hz. Many
path-following methods rely on the time parametrization, but struggle to handle
collision and singularity avoidance while adhering kinematic limits or other
constraints. Specifically, the error between the desired path and the actual
position can become large when executing evasive maneuvers. Thus, this paper
derives a method that parametrizes the reference path by a path parameter and
performs the optimization via RMPCC. In particular, Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) are introduced to avoid collisions and singularities in dynamic
environments. A Jacobian-based linearization and Gauss-Newton Hessian
approximation enable solving the nonlinear RMPCC problem at 100 Hz,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 10. Experiments confirm
that the framework handles dynamic obstacles in real-world settings with low
contouring error and low robot acceleration.

Abstract: Typical marine environments are highly complex with spatio-temporally varying
currents and dynamic obstacles, presenting significant challenges to Unmanned
Surface Vehicles (USVs) for safe and efficient navigation. Thus, the USVs need
to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid
collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting
ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called
Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents
(SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic
environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time
cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of
SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV
performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents
to successfully reach the goal.

Abstract: The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of
applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and
textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation
scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel
two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when
grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail
is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping
on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a
single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed
fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control
is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state
estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on
motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with
a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the
pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our
reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for
future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) is one of the key challenges in
multi-robot systems (MRSs) and has broad applications across various fields.
This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory
planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key
strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for
duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance
of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT
1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to
baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict
scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high
solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline
methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging
configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP,
further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical
robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 为高度沉浸式虚拟现实应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to
enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially
available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited
workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the
human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale
kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm
as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while
providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel
admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to
render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances.
Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations,
including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its
control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality
applications.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there
is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional
robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize
predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments.
This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language
understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural
language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions
by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular
integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as
person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series
of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in
real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of
approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

Abstract: Agile flight for the quadrotor cable-suspended payload system is a formidable
challenge due to its underactuated, highly nonlinear, and hybrid dynamics.
Traditional optimization-based methods often struggle with high computational
costs and the complexities of cable mode transitions, limiting their real-time
applicability and maneuverability exploitation. In this letter, we present
FLARE, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly learns agile
navigation policy from high-fidelity simulation. Our method is validated across
three designed challenging scenarios, notably outperforming a state-of-the-art
optimization-based approach by a 3x speedup during gate traversal maneuvers.
Furthermore, the learned policies achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real
transfer, demonstrating remarkable agility and safety in real-world
experiments, running in real time on an onboard computer.

Abstract: To enable robots to develop human-like fine manipulation, it is essential to
understand how mechanical compliance, multi-modal sensing, and purposeful
interaction jointly shape tactile perception. In this study, we use a dedicated
modular e-Skin with tunable mechanical compliance and multi-modal sensing
(normal, shear forces and vibrations) to systematically investigate how sensing
embodiment and interaction strategies influence robotic perception of objects.
Leveraging a curated set of soft wave objects with controlled viscoelastic and
surface properties, we explore a rich set of palpation primitives-pressing,
precession, sliding that vary indentation depth, frequency, and directionality.
In addition, we propose the latent filter, an unsupervised, action-conditioned
deep state-space model of the sophisticated interaction dynamics and infer
causal mechanical properties into a structured latent space. This provides
generalizable and in-depth interpretable representation of how embodiment and
interaction determine and influence perception. Our investigation demonstrates
that multi-modal sensing outperforms uni-modal sensing. It highlights a nuanced
interaction between the environment and mechanical properties of e-Skin, which
should be examined alongside the interaction by incorporating temporal
dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents an object-aware whole-body bilateral teleoperation
framework for wheeled humanoid loco-manipulation. This framework combines
whole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial
parameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this
work. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object
size estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language
model (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size
estimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial
parameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based
refinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy
first estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size
to ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis
scheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in
parallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online
updates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled
humanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion
and manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for
dynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By
compensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework
also improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior. We
validate the system on a customized wheeled humanoid with a robotic gripper and
human-machine interface, demonstrating real-time execution of lifting,
delivering, and releasing tasks with a payload weighing approximately one-third
of the robot's body weight.

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human
and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such
as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw,
real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the
physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective
alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace
remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies,
focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need
for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable
the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while
avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages
sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes
to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a
camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose
changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose
changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and
real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method
serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover
task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Abstract: Exoskeletons have been shown to effectively assist humans during steady
locomotion. However, their effects on non-steady locomotion, characterized by
nonlinear phase progression within a gait cycle, remain insufficiently
explored, particularly across diverse activities. This work presents a shank
angle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time
coordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically
shaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns
across walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists
of an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward
control method. The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model
with the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU
measurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to
inter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking
control employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a
feedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the
lack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three
experiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple
subjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method,
demonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations
across various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and
physiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical
assistance.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了腿式机器人在无外部传感器情况下的狭窄空间穿越能力。

Abstract: The legged locomotion in spatially constrained structures (called crawl
spaces) is challenging. In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion
learning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in
possible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion
learning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground
features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive
locomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is
proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's
surrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states
using historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in
polar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to
efficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise
the state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that
guide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed.
Experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits
more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of
legged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring
exteroceptive sensors.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental
fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal
across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized
Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed
to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from
human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an
adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically
retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our
novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,
high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire
framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac
Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple
configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training
policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent
performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first
practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid
controllers.

Method: 论文提出了边际增益优势估计（MGAE）、语义动态模型（SDM）和约束演员动态估计器（CADE）架构，结合子模马尔可夫决策过程框架，实现了模型化安全强化学习。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MGAE比传统方法收敛更快且性能更优，SDM提供了更准确的短期状态预测，CADE成功将安全约束集成到强化学习中。

Conclusion: CADE通过拉格朗日方法在训练中平衡奖励与安全，并通过安全层在推理中增强性能，为无人机自主河流跟踪提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is
critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental
monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are
unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which
the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique
river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov
Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which
refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline
computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage
estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in
non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on
patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and
data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent
vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics
Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM
for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of
solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.
Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and
superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized
Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions
that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,
CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the
Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during
training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard
action overlay.

Motivation: 机器人操作研究面临数据稀缺问题，现有数据集远小于语言和视觉领域的数据集。

Method: 通过估计3D手部姿势、修复人类手臂并叠加机器人轨迹，将人类视频转化为机器人演示，并预训练视觉编码器。

Result: 在三个未见过的场景中，Masquerade方法比基线方法表现好5-6倍。

Conclusion: 通过缩小视觉体现差距，人类视频可以成为提升机器人策略的宝贵数据源。

Abstract: Robot manipulation research still suffers from significant data scarcity:
even the largest robot datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less
diverse than those that fueled recent breakthroughs in language and vision. We
introduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos
to bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a
robot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into
robotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the
human arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the
recovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict
future 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing
that auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot
demonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better
than prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in
three unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations
show that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and
performance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video. These
results demonstrate that explicitly closing the visual embodiment gap unlocks a
vast, readily available source of data from human videos that can be used to
improve robot policies.
