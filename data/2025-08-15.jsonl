Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages.

D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically\ntrained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the\ncontrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the\nfailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement\nwhen using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential\nfor improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach."}

Particularly in small and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,\nmaintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,\nmany companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in\nsome cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic\nresearch on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in\nthe design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by\nresearchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart\nsystem, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot\ninterfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that\nreduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system.

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911).

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work\nfocuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either\nwith large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.\nInstead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that\nfilters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while\nkeeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,\nwe propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for\nactions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper\nstate.

Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate\nPoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head\npose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing\ncalibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.\nSpecifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial\nimages from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or\ncontinuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically\nanalyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences\nestimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of\nhead poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose\nvariation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy\nin which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones.

To address the problem of balancing\nmultiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a\ntrajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This\napproach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected\ntrajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment\nscenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of\npolicy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a\nTrajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network.

A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating\ntext-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The\napproach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong\ncross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and\nimage. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge\nsketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.\nThis enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated\nimages. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive\nloss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A\nmulti-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic\nconsistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic\nexperiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art\nretraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness\nagainst diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean\naccuracy."}

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is\nparticularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the\npracticality of our approach in real-world scenarios."}

However,\nthe deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty\nwheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international\nstandards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC\npolicy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while\nadhering to safety standards to some extent.

The method establishes a federated training framework\ninvolving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private\nresource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is\noptimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while\npreserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage\npatterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This\nallows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while\nsharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance\nis used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and\nstability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a\ncloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study\nevaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise\ninjection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's\nrobustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in\nvarious complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical\npotential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud\ncomputing environments."}

Most exploration\nstrategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,\nthey do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than\nothers, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a\nmethod that identifies \\emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high\ninterest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network\nthat, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate\nwhether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not.

RAP\naugments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external\nknowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During\ntraining, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint\nsimilarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's\nOOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time\nbased on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to\nthe test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For\nexample, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the\naverage FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous\nmethods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the\neffectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach."}

Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial\nviews remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the\ninterpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view\nlocalization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a\nnovel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,\nand a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global\nresidual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.\nTo further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first\nbenchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level\ncorrespondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsubstantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,\nsetting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity."}

Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements\nother investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are\nunavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in\nwildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting\nanalysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime."}

This visual-to-neural\nmapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs\nreliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and\nsubjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain\nadapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes\nhigh-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited\nfMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional\nconsistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing\ninterpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will\nbe made publicly available."}

With large\nfoundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL\nthrough cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However,\nour empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual\nattention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To\nguide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose\nReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.\nConditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to\nreconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target\nmanipulated objects.

Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training\nset as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable\ndata source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error\ntrajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate\nself-correction data for perception and action.

We introduce a unifying spectral framework to\nsystematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their\ntrade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the\ncontribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a\nprincipled approach to identifying this trade-off.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for\ndecadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline\nthat assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a\nyear held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq\n0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding\ncorroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns\nfrom historical data that are significant for projecting future change.\nFinally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on\nphysical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of\ndifferent scenarios by means of driver variables."}
