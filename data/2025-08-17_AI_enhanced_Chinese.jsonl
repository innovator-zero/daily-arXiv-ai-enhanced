Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

By integrating\ncontact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,\nunified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and\nreactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the\nAtalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08HDDPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u53cc\u8db3\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Hankel\u77e9\u9635\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b65\u95f4\uff08S2S\uff09\u8fc7\u6e21\u589e\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u8db3\u90e8\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Atalante\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HDDPC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, this work introduces an\ninnovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse\ndata, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR\n(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration\nand the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the\nreconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key\ncontributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR\nreflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for\nNRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane\ndetection using the generated dense reflectance images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6LiDAR\u53cd\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672cLiDAR\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\uff08\u5982LiDAR\uff09\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u4f4e\u6210\u672cLiDAR\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u53cd\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u975e\u91cd\u590d\u626b\u63cfLiDAR\uff08NRS-LiDAR\uff09\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u53cd\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2aLiDAR\u53cd\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e13\u4e3aNRS-LiDAR\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u73af\u8def\u95ed\u5408\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u53cd\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672cLiDAR\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information\non the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and\nhandwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are\nextremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to\nobtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools.

No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time.

For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability.

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u5371\u91cd\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\uff08AKI\uff09\uff0cLightGBM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u809d\u786c\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u4e2dAKI\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0eICU\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86MIMIC-IV v2.2\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u4e861240\u540d\u809d\u786c\u5316ICU\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u524d48\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u540e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUROC 0.808\uff09\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u5305\u62ec\u90e8\u5206\u51dd\u8840\u6d3b\u9176\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\u3001pH\u503c\u4f4e\u7b49\uff0c\u4e0e\u809d\u786c\u5316-AKI\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316ICU\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u65e9\u671fAKI\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u964d\u7ea7\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work\nfocuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either\nwith large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.\nInstead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that\nfilters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while\nkeeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,\nwe propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for\nactions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper\nstate.

To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing\ncalibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.\nSpecifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial\nimages from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or\ncontinuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically\nanalyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences\nestimation accuracy.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels.

However,\nthe deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty\nwheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international\nstandards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC\npolicy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while\nadhering to safety standards to some extent.

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset.

However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting\ntheir adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework\nthat automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from\nuser-defined objectives.

This visual-to-neural\nmapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs\nreliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and\nsubjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain\nadapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes\nhigh-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited\nfMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional\nconsistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing\ninterpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability.

Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,\nthis framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used\nultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the\ndegree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.\nWe evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world\ndiagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic\nquantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological\nreports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high\nprecision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features\nsimultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal\npathologists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGlo-DMU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u80be\u5c0f\u7403\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80be\u810f\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8d85\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u3001\u80be\u5c0f\u7403\u6ee4\u8fc7\u5c4f\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u81f4\u5bc6\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e38\u89c4\u80be\u6d3b\u68c0\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728115\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u5f62\u6001\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Glo-DMU\u4e3a\u80be\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission\nobjectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational\nefficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment\nincorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'\nsuperiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)\ndemonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model.

Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance\nmotion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of\njointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains\nlargely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts\nhuman dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the\negocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose\nestimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the\ngenerated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical\ninputs.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem.

Time series\nSuper-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of\nupsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have\ninsufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning\nparadigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training\nrequires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in\nupsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,\nthis paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial\nTransformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth\nhigh-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the\nintroduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling\ntasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application\nscenario is improved by 13%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08GATs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08GATs\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e869%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8613%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GATs\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Following the insertion tests, computed\ntomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation\nof insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.\nSystem Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.\nTool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy\nmeasures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues.

Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,\nPractical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack\neffectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present\na tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack\ntransferability under PASR.

While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved\nnotable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to\nsuppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary\nKernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain\nprocessing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural\npreservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and\ntrainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both\nspatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual\nunderstanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while\nmaintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that\nFIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art\nMAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR\nimprovement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's\nability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively\nsuppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's\npotential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural\npreservation and improved clinical applicability.

With the rapid development of graph neural networks\n(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.\nHowever, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,\nGNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,\npotentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on\ndeveloping fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where\nmodels often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based\nstructures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.\nTo address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose\n\\textbf{D}is\\textbf{E}ntangled \\textbf{C}ounterfactual \\textbf{A}dversarial\n\\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving\nGAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to\ndisentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations.

However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on\nsparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment\nknowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that\ntackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level\nknowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting\nstrategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating\nattribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond\nlabels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is\napplied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from\nirrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image\nembeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text\nembeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to\nunseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference\ndynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and\nattribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.\nExtensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel\ngeneralization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemPT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u6216LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "SemPT\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover\nlearns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a\nresource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides\nformal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of\nProbably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover\nand Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that\nare {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean\nSquared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}.

It\nrequires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in\noccluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many\nexisting methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views\nor train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.\nAdditionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.\nThis gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view\ntranslation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative\ncapabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from\na novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ\na camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted\nlatent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled\nusing the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,\nwe propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation\nstructure observed in DDIM inversion.

Specifically, we\nintroduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,\nand a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global\nresidual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.\nTo further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first\nbenchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level\ncorrespondences.

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup.

Current deepfake detection methods\nperform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to\ndatasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging\nand traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection\nmethods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly\nineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake\ndetection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative\nforgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided\nLearning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously\nadapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures\nthe differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,\nallowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To\nfurther improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual\nPerception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships\namong forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically\nperceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery\ntechniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then\nintegrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In\naddition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the\nentire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of\nforgery trace correlations.

Through a coordinate descent strategy and a\ncentrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic\natlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we\ndemonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels\nannotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse\ndeformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape\nsynthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas\nmesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields.

In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the\ninvestigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a\nrefined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to\npersonalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on\nadaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional\nmodalities, including time-series and multilingual data.

Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact.

While QINRs recently\nemerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their\narchitecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,\ntraining efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper\nadvances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D\ngeometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual\nField (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural\namplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful\nHilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of\nlearnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations\nperformed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training\nwith fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in\ncontrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs\nprojective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.\nExperiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms\nthe existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines\nin terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model\ncharacteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show\napplications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,\nhighlighting its practical potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "QINRs\u7684\u65b0\u7c7b\u578bQVF\u7528\u4e8e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3QINRs\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u5757\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u5e45\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5168\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "QVF\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "QVF\u57282D\u548c3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u573a\u5b8c\u6210\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u63d2\u503c\u3002"}}
