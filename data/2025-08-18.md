### [1] [Privacy Enhancement for Gaze Data Using a Noise-Infused Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10918)
*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在噪声自编码器的隐私增强机制，保护用户视线数据不被未经同意跨会话重识别，同时保留数据的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护用户视线数据的隐私，防止未经同意的重识别，同时确保数据在良性任务中的可用性。

Method: 使用潜在噪声自编码器对视线信号进行处理，平衡隐私与实用性。

Result: 显著降低了生物识别的可识别性，同时实用性损失最小，且保留了生理上合理的视线模式。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据提供了有效且实用的隐私保护方案，推动了视线系统隐私保护的发展。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

*Jianlong Wu,Wei Liu,Ye Liu,Meng Liu,Liqiang Nie,Zhouchen Lin,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频时间定位（VTG）研究，填补了该领域综述的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VTG-MLLMs在多任务、多领域和零样本设置中表现优异，但缺乏系统性综述。

Method: 通过三维分类法（功能角色、训练范式、视频特征处理）分析VTG-MLLMs。

Result: 总结了当前研究的实证发现、数据集和评估协议。

Conclusion: 指出了现有局限并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By \underline{V}alue \underline{S}ign \underline{F}lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负提示引导上存在不足，VSF旨在更高效地抑制不需要的内容。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号动态抑制内容，计算开销小，兼容多种架构。

Result: 实验表明VSF在少步模型中显著提升负提示遵循能力，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且兼容性强的负提示引导方法，适用于静态图像和视频生成。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [4] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于提升单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。现有APR方法虽有效，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法通常精度更高。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用PAE-based RPR优化APR预测。通过对比实验验证其有效性，并展示在室内基准测试中提升APR定位精度。

Result: 方法在仅使用30%数据训练时仍能保持竞争力，显著减少零售部署中的数据收集负担。

Conclusion: PAE-based RPR是一种高效且数据需求低的相机定位优化方案，适用于零售环境。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

### [5] [ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，性能优于现有基线，并用于标注大规模视频数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从野外视频中获取一致且精确的3D注释的挑战，支持多样场景和相机模型。

Method: ViPE通过估计相机内参、运动和密集深度图，适用于动态自拍、电影镜头等多种场景。

Result: 在TUM/KITTI序列上性能提升18%/50%，运行速度为3-5FPS，并标注了96M帧的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 开源ViPE和标注数据集，旨在加速空间AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

### [6] [HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10935)
*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，通过高质量伪标签提升开放词汇3D检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭集3D检测无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法忽略几何质量。

Method: 结合IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用跨模态几何一致性和标注类几何先验。

Result: 在新型类上mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或高质量伪标签生成器，提升开放词汇检测性能。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

### [7] [Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936)
*Cheng Chen,Hao Huang,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占据预测方法，解决了现有方法通信成本高或依赖深度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在协作场景中因高通信成本或依赖深度估计而受限，需更高效且不依赖额外监督的方法。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码及稀疏通信。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别优于单代理和基线协作方法，且在低通信量下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于通信受限的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

### [8] [Personalized Face Super-Resolution with Identity Decoupling and Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10937)
*Jiarui Yang,Hang Guo,Wen Huang,Tao Dai,Shutao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IDFSR的新方法，通过身份解耦和拟合技术，在极端退化场景下提升人脸超分辨率的身份一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端退化场景（如缩放因子大于8倍）下，传统方法难以恢复真实且身份一致的人脸图像，容易产生幻觉效果。

Method: 采用掩码、变形和身份嵌入三种设计，预训练扩散模型以解耦风格和身份，并通过轻量级微调优化身份嵌入。

Result: 在极端退化条件下，IDFSR在身份一致性和感知质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合技术，有效解决了极端退化场景下的人脸超分辨率问题。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统池化方法在特征表达和鲁棒性方面存在不足，NIRMAL Pooling旨在通过动态调整参数和非线性激活提升性能。

Method: NIRMAL Pooling结合自适应最大池化和ReLU激活函数，动态调整参数以适应输出维度。

Result: 在MNIST Digits、MNIST Fashion和CIFAR-10数据集上，NIRMAL Pooling的测试准确率均优于传统最大池化。

Conclusion: NIRMAL Pooling为图像识别任务提供了一种灵活可靠的池化方法，显著提升了CNN性能。

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

### [11] [Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942)
*Liming Xu,Dave Towey,Andrew P. French,Steve Benford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了Artcodes的检测问题，提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图）来识别拓扑结构相似的装饰性标记，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中可能出现更多与虚拟元素连接的装饰性物体，识别这些物体是触发后续交互的第一步。

Method: 提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图），用于描述Artcode的通用拓扑结构，并构建了检测系统进行实验评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的特征向量能有效表示拓扑结构，系统在Artcode检测中表现良好。

Conclusion: 尽管是初步尝试，但该研究为拓扑物体检测开辟了新方向，并可能激发更多应用。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用低分辨率CT量化干纺织增强材料在压实过程中嵌套行为的框架，并通过3D-UNet和两点相关函数分析空间结构，结果与显微图像验证一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解材料在多尺度上的结构对纺织增强复合材料的预测建模至关重要，嵌套行为对机械性能有重要影响。

Method: 使用低分辨率CT进行原位压实实验，通过3D-UNet进行语义分割，并利用两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型在分割任务中表现优异（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），并成功提取了平均层厚度和嵌套程度。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业相关CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为逆向建模和基于描述符的结构分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

*Wonho Lee,Hyunsik Na,Jisu Lee,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPG方法高效生成对抗性补丁，比现有方法快11.1倍，且攻击效果相当，适用于多种AI安全应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成挑战，尤其在计算机视觉任务中。传统对抗样本仅针对特定区域，导致模型失效。

Method: 提出增量补丁生成（IPG）方法，通过实验和消融研究（如YOLO特征分布可视化）验证其高效性和泛化能力。

Result: IPG生成的补丁能广泛覆盖模型漏洞，且生成的数据集可作为构建鲁棒模型的基础。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、医疗影像）中具有潜力，能提升AI模型在动态高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Result: 基准测试显示现有多模态模型在多阶段临床推理中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医学AI提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

TL;DR: FastFOD-Net 是一种基于深度学习的加速框架，用于增强纤维取向分布（FOD）的可靠性，适用于临床扩散 MRI 数据分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床扩散 MRI 数据（单壳低角度分辨率）中 FOD 估计的可靠性问题，并推动深度学习在临床中的应用。

Method: 采用优化的深度学习框架 FastFOD-Net，加速 FOD 增强过程（比前代快 60 倍），并在健康人和六种神经系统疾病患者中验证。

Result: FastFOD-Net 在临床数据中表现优异，支持疾病区分、连接组分析，并减少测量误差。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net 有望加速临床神经科学研究，提升深度学习在扩散 MRI 中的可信度和应用范围。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态任务中表现出色，但数据质量、复杂任务表现和评估协议的不足限制了其可靠性和广泛应用。

Method: 通过外部工具（如API、专家模型和知识库）增强MLLMs，从数据获取、任务性能、评估和未来发展四个维度展开讨论。

Result: 外部工具能显著提升MLLMs的数据质量、任务表现和评估准确性，具有广阔的应用前景。

Conclusion: 外部工具是推动MLLMs发展的关键，未来需进一步探索其潜力和应用。

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在对象属性推理上的表现，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准测试在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏多样性和复杂性，因此需要更系统的评估框架。

Method: 设计了包含三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四种对象属性的基准测试ORBIT，包含360张图像和1,080个问题。

Result: 12种先进视觉语言模型在零样本设置下表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了现有模型的局限性，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试和推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高光谱成像（HSI）的方法，通过选择信息量最大的波段来增强对易受伤害道路使用者（VRU）的感知能力，显著减少了视觉模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车感知系统中因视觉模糊（如同色异谱现象）导致的VRU识别困难问题。

Method: 结合信息论技术（联合互信息最大化、相关性分析）和图像质量指标（对比信噪比）选择最具信息量的HSI波段。

Result: 在H-City数据集上，选定的三个波段（497 nm、607 nm、895 nm）显著提高了VRU与背景的区分度，各项指标提升70.24%至1206.83%。

Conclusion: 该方法为ADAS和自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的感知输入，有助于提升道路安全性。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVCtrl是一种轻量级控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，显著提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet在视频生成中引入高延迟和冗余计算，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略，分区网络并选择性跳过冗余计算步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现2倍以上的速度提升，且生成质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: EVCtrl无需重新训练模型即可高效控制生成，适用于图像和视频。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，填补了此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者收集数据，构建提示用于VLMs模拟，并评估模拟结果与原始回答的一致性。

Result: VLMs在最小提示下推断超出指定视力能力，一致性较低（0.59）；结合视觉信息和示例图像响应显著提高一致性（0.70）。

Conclusion: 结合视觉信息和示例图像响应能有效提升VLMs模拟低视力人群视觉感知的准确性，但额外示例效果有限。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏公开数据集来全面评估和微调VLMs在建筑安全检查中的应用，现有数据集规模小且监督性强，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 构建了包含图像描述、安全规则违反视觉问答（VQA）和建筑元素视觉定位三个任务的标注数据集，并评估了现有VLMs的零样本和少样本性能。

Result: 评估显示现有VLMs在零样本和少样本设置下具有显著泛化能力，但仍需额外训练以适应实际建筑工地场景。

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k为研究人员提供了训练和评估新VLMs的基准，推动了建筑安全检查领域的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型（如MedSAM）因数据有限、异质性和分布偏移等问题，泛化能力受限。MedSAMix旨在通过模型合并解决这些问题。

Method: 提出零阶优化方法自动发现最优层合并方案，并通过单任务优化和多目标优化两种机制满足不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务中，MedSAMix在专用任务和多任务评估中分别提升6.67%和4.37%的性能。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过模型合并有效缓解模型偏差，提升医学图像分割的领域特异性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D VL数据集在远距离对象和多视角推理方面存在不足，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集（68%问题需多视角推理）和TripAlign预训练语料（1M三元组），并开发LEGO基线方法。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答基准上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign为3D VL学习提供了更丰富的多视角和多对象对齐信号，推动了领域发展。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖人群中的疾病分布不均，提示详细体成分分析可能揭示腹部表型与糖尿病的关系。

Method: 通过AI分割腹部CT扫描，使用随机森林分类和SHAP分析，识别不同BMI亚组（瘦、超重、肥胖）的糖尿病相关体成分特征。

Result: 随机森林模型AUC为0.72-0.74，发现肌肉脂肪化、内脏脂肪增多等是各亚组的共同风险因素。

Conclusion: 腹部体成分特征可能是跨体重类别的2型糖尿病共同驱动因素。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层和语义部分建模，显著提升了3D生成的性能。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

platforms for proactive ergonomic management, improving quality of life at low
costs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于残差的双向扩散模型（RBDM），实现雾图和去雾图的双向转换，仅需15步采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅关注去雾，缺乏雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换能力。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于或至少与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: RBDM成功实现了雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换，且计算高效。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

Method: 设计了SCLIP编码器生成统一语义嵌入，引入跨模态多尺度对齐模块和尺度感知融合网络。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC算法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated
BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the
first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic
structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released

Motivation: 现有去雾方法在真实浓雾场景中表现不佳，主要因缺乏真实配对数据和鲁棒先验。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: EM-B3DM是一种高效的去雾方法，尤其适用于真实浓雾场景。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在遥感图像中，源自由目标检测（SFOD）因隐私和传输限制无法访问源数据，但伪标签噪声导致训练崩溃，需要一种新方法解决。

Method: VG-DETR结合视觉基础模型（VFM），通过伪标签挖掘策略和双级对齐（实例和图像级）提升伪标签质量和特征鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明VG-DETR在源自由遥感检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过VFM的语义先验和双级对齐，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉内容评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键评估指标的关注。

Method: 采用整数标签（范围[10,50]）和目标掩码策略（仅计算前两位整数的损失），优化模型学习关键评估组件。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签微调在定量评估场景中优化视觉语言模型的有效性，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续类别发现（CCD）中缺乏类别数量和标签信息，且需避免灾难性遗忘，现有方法难以平衡新类发现与分类的矛盾，且存储开销大。

Method: IDOD方法包含独立多样性模块、联合发现模块和正交性模块，分别通过对比损失训练、单阶段新类发现和正交原型生成来优化性能。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了CCD中的矛盾与存储问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有适配器方法在视觉和文本表示对齐时依赖显式空间邻近性，无法捕捉类别与图像样本之间的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: 引入可学习的属性提示作为桥梁，将类别、属性和图像投影到双曲空间，并利用层次正则化学习潜在语义层次结构。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上的实验表明，LatHAdapter显著优于其他微调方法，尤其在已知类别适应和未知类别泛化方面。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过建模潜在语义层次结构，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了少样本分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法在空间和时间上缺乏灵活性，GVT旨在解决这一问题。

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GVT在视频处理任务中实现了先进性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: CHARM3R解决了相机高度变化对单目3D检测的影响，达到了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car

we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable
device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset
through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂空间语义和实时性要求。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和多阶段强化学习（RL）的混合方法，结合GRPO算法提升推理结构化和可解释性。

Result: UAV-VL-R1在零样本任务中准确率比基线高48.17%，且内存占用低，适合实时部署。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1通过GRPO强化学习弥补了SFT的局限性，提升了逻辑灵活性和推理鲁棒性，适用于资源受限的无人机平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Method: 两阶段知识蒸馏：第一阶段引入关节结构损失挖掘语义信息；第二阶段使用IGP-GCN渐进式优化姿态。

Result: 在COCO和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了轻量级姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶场景中的行人重识别提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多维度偏好（如运动自然性、唇同步准确性和视觉质量）上难以对齐，且缺乏高质量标注数据集。

Method: 引入Talking-Critic学习人类对齐的奖励函数，构建Talking-NSQ数据集，提出TLPO框架解耦并融合多维度偏好。

Result: Talking-Critic在人类偏好评分上显著优于现有方法，TLPO在唇同步、运动自然性和视觉质量上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Talking-Critic和TLPO有效解决了多维度偏好对齐问题，提升了肖像动画的生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在密集感知任务中因局部特征表示不足而表现不佳。

Method: 提出DeCLIP框架，通过解耦自注意力模块，分别优化内容和上下文特征，并利用视觉基础模型和扩散模型增强特征。

Result: 在多种任务中实现最优性能，包括2D检测、分割、3D实例分割等。

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉语言模型中的性别偏见，并提出了评估方法，为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

Result: 实验证明该方法在分割准确率上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过关注几何不变信息，有效提升了3D语义分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Result: 在CIR基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架在监督式CIR任务中有效且高效，代码将公开。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Motivation: 探索SAEs在视觉模型中的表现力，填补其在视觉领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过多种视觉任务评估SAEs在视觉嵌入模型、多模态LMM和扩散模型中的表现。

Result: SAE特征具有语义意义，提升泛化能力，并支持可控生成。

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中具有显著潜力，可提升可解释性、泛化和可控性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Motivation: 单目内窥镜在手术中面临深度模糊、组织变形、运动不一致等挑战，需要一种鲁棒的解决方案来提升导航和空间感知能力。

Method: 框架包含MAPIS-Depth模块（结合Depth Pro和Depth Anything进行深度预测）和WEMA-RTDL模块（优化旋转和平移），并通过RAFT和LPIPS进行时间细化。

Result: 在HEVD和SCARED数据集上的评估表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成多模块和优化技术，显著提升了单目内窥镜的3D重建效果。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TimeMachine提供了一种高效且精确的面部年龄编辑解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Conclusion: 最优HSI波段选择能有效减少误报，为安全关键型汽车应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪再检索范式可提升VMR性能，且能无缝集成到其他先进模型中。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

Result: LogicCLIP在逻辑理解任务上显著优于基线模型，同时在通用视觉语言任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLM逻辑能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上验证了方法的有效性，达到了73.2%和70.3%的AMOTA。

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过空间线索一致性显著提升了3D多目标跟踪的性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有的扩散分类器（DC）存在噪声不稳定性问题，不同随机采样的噪声会导致性能显著变化，而现有方法通过集成大量噪声结果来稳定性能，但会显著降低分类速度。

Method: NoOp通过频率匹配和空间匹配原则优化噪声：1）优化数据集特定的噪声；2）训练一个元网络生成图像特定的噪声偏移。

Result: 在各种数据集上的广泛实验证明了NoOp的有效性。

Conclusion: NoOp通过学习匹配噪声，显著提高了扩散分类器的稳定性和分类速度。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IAQD的新蒸馏方法，用于解决基于Transformer的增量目标检测中的知识遗忘问题，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在增量目标检测中，基于Transformer的模型容易因知识蒸馏中的匈牙利匹配导致知识遗忘，需要更有效的方法来保留旧类别的知识。

Method: 提出Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD)，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 在代表性基准测试中，IAQD显著减少了知识遗忘，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种有效的蒸馏方法，能够在不干扰新类别学习的情况下保留旧类别的知识。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类方法需要大量代表性训练数据，人工成本高昂，因此需要一种更经济高效的方法。

Method: 利用分类器对未标注宫颈细胞图像的不确定性，选择最有价值的图像进行标注。

Result: 新算法通过快速估计不确定性，显著提升了训练数据集的代表性，并降低了人工成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效宫颈细胞分类提供了可行途径，证实了其在优化人工成本方面的有效性。

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义引导的对抗目标选择框架，利用跨模态知识转移提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击的目标标签选择方法缺乏解释性、可重复性或灵活性，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 利用预训练语言和视觉语言模型（如BERT、TinyLLAMA、CLIP）的跨模态知识，选择与真实标签最相关和最不相关的语义标签。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于静态语义资源（如WordNet），尤其适用于远距离类别关系，并能构建可解释、标准化的对抗基准。

Conclusion: 预训练模型适合用于构建跨架构和数据集的对抗基准，提升攻击的标准化和可扩展性。

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: HOID-R1是一个结合CoT引导的SFT和GRPO的HOI检测框架，通过强化学习提升性能，并在开放世界泛化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇HOI检测方法依赖大语言模型，但忽视了其3D空间理解能力，HOID-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合CoT引导的SFT和GRPO，通过多奖励信号优化策略，并引入MLLM监督机制减少幻觉。

Result: 在HOI检测基准上达到SOTA，并在开放世界泛化中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过整合多模态对齐和推理能力，显著提升了HOI检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Motivation: 探索RETFound在视盘分割任务中的应用，验证基础模型在特定任务中的潜力。

Method: 通过少量任务特定样本训练头部网络，适配RETFound进行视盘分割。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上达到约96%的Dice分数，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现卓越，支持基础模型替代任务特定架构的潜力。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Motivation: 探讨拓扑保持损失函数在图像分割中的实际效果，验证SRL是否如声称那样优于传统方法。

Method: 通过理论分析SRL的梯度，并在多个细管状数据集上对比SRL与传统模型的性能。

Result: SRL在实验中的表现未超越传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在捕捉细粒度实例细节和复杂关系结构方面表现不佳，导致性能不理想。

Method: 结合动态硬挖掘策略的实例级嵌入蒸馏和基于记忆库机制的关系相似性蒸馏。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，学生模型甚至能超越教师模型的准确率。

Conclusion: 统一框架通过同时优化实例对齐和关系保留，实现了更全面的知识蒸馏。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Method: 在CUT3R基础上轻量修改，为每种模态设计专用编码器，通过零卷积与RGB图像特征融合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升性能，并能灵活适应不同输入模态。

Conclusion: G-CUT3R有效利用先验信息，兼容多种输入模态，为3D重建任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

TL;DR: RMFAT是一种轻量级循环框架，用于高效恢复受大气湍流影响的视频，显著降低计算负担并提升实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致视频质量下降，现有方法计算成本高，难以实时部署。

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和解码模块增强时空一致性。

Result: 在清晰度恢复和推理速度上均优于现有方法，SSIM提升9%，运行时间减少四倍。

Conclusion: RMFAT适用于实时大气湍流抑制任务，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use
extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly

Motivation: 生物识别广泛应用，但模板隐私和安全性是关键问题，且同态加密带来计算挑战。多模态融合可提升安全性，但需解决计算效率问题。

Method: 利用深度神经网络提取多模态特征，进行维度减少，结合同态加密实现高效加密处理。

Result: 实验表明，多模态融合下模板尺寸减少67%，且等错误率（EER）与最佳单模态相当。

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合在减少模板尺寸的同时，保持了高安全性和准确性，适用于加密环境。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM的优势，实现了高效的自动驾驶规划与场景生成，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Conclusion: 当前3D物体移除技术存在局限性，需更鲁棒的解决方案以应对现实世界的复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

Result: 实验表明，MM-R1以零样本方式生成高保真主题和强文本对齐的图像。

Conclusion: MM-R1显著提升了统一MLLMs在个性化图像生成中的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

technology has emerged as a double-edged sword. It has not only created a large
amount of AI-generated content but also posed unprecedented challenges to
digital security. The task of the competition is to determine whether a face
image is a Deepfake image and output its probability score of being a Deepfake
image. In the image track competition, our approach is based on the Swin
Transformer V2-B classification network. And online data augmentation and
offline sample generation methods are employed to enrich the diversity of
training samples and increase the generalization ability of the model. Finally,
we got the award of excellence in Deepfake image detection.

Conclusion: 领域特定的增强和集成策略对提升历史手稿识别性能具有重要影响。

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

TL;DR: CoFi是一种快速高效的粗到细少样本分割方法，用于电子显微镜图像中的肾小球基底膜分割，显著减少标注和计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法需要大量标注，而少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构细节，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CoFi先通过三张标注图像训练轻量网络生成粗分割掩码，再通过形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，引导SAM细化分割。

Result: Dice系数74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，表现优异。

Conclusion: CoFi在减少标注和计算负担的同时，实现了准确可靠的分割，适合研究和临床应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate
Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

Result: CineTrans生成的视频在过渡控制、时间一致性和整体质量上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CineTrans通过掩码机制和数据集微调，成功生成了具有电影风格的多镜头视频，解决了现有模型的过渡不稳定问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in
buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage.
Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional

various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了MLLMs的视觉定位能力，并实现了动态控制，为实际应用提供了灵活性。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

Motivation: 现有方法采用感知-规划顺序执行模式，感知与规划分离可能导致优化不足。VeteranAD旨在通过感知与规划的紧密耦合，实现更精准的自动驾驶行为。

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive数据集上，VeteranAD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的耦合设计，显著提升了端到端自动驾驶的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HGFE是一种轻量级、可端到端训练的方法，能显著增强CNN的表现。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进真实特征使用，提升泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

Motivation: 现有高效跟踪器因计算复杂度和参数减少导致特征表示能力弱，限制了单层特征捕捉目标状态的能力。

Method: MST采用轻量级状态特定增强（SSE）和多状态生成（MSG）结合跨状态交互（CSI），增强特征表示。

Result: MST在多个数据集上优于先前高效跟踪器，GOT-10K数据集上AO得分提升4.5%。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计显著提升跟踪性能，同时保持低计算开销。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理和高效训练，显著提升了视频推理分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

TL;DR: TrajSV是一个基于轨迹的框架，通过数据预处理、CRNet和VRNet三个组件，解决了体育分析中的数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，并在体育视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体育分析领域存在数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，需要一种新的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: TrajSV包含数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet)和Video Representation Network (VRNet)，利用轨迹增强的Transformer模块和无监督的三重对比损失优化视频和片段表示。

Result: 在体育视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中，TrajSV分别实现了70%、9/17类别最佳和20%的性能提升。

Conclusion: TrajSV在体育视频分析中表现出色，并通过部署系统展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型（VideoLMs）中，时间理解主要依赖于帧间注意力而非位置编码（PEs）。通过分析，揭示了时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成的机制，并提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频语言模型在多模态理解方面取得进展，但时间理解（如事件顺序、持续时间和跨时间关系）仍是核心挑战。研究旨在探索时间信息在模型中的整合机制。

Method: 通过实验分析时间信息的整合路径，发现时间线索通过帧间注意力逐步合成，并提出两种效率优化策略：分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制。

Result: 实验证明，时间理解主要依赖于帧间注意力，而非位置编码。提出的两种策略在基准测试中表现有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了时间理解的机制，为未来模型优化提供了新思路，并提出了高效的实现方法。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不适用于实时监测，因此需要一种快速、低成本且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频中生成空间和结构数据。

Result: 深度校正模型表现优异（R2 = 0.92），地理位置误差平均为2.83米，高度估计误差为2.09米（树木）和0.88米（杆状物）。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了实时、低成本且高效的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

TL;DR: CoreEditor提出了一种新的文本驱动3D编辑框架，通过对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性，解决了多视图一致性问题，并提供了选择性编辑流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动的3D编辑中缺乏对多视图信息交换的显式控制，导致编辑不足和细节模糊。

Method: CoreEditor引入了对应约束注意力机制，结合几何对齐和语义相似性，实现多视图一致性编辑，并提供选择性编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，有效解决了多视图一致性问题，提升了文本驱动3D编辑的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

TL;DR: LoRAtorio是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过利用模型内在行为实现高效组合，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合时效果不佳，尤其是在开放场景中。

Method: 在潜在空间中划分空间块，计算余弦相似度构建权重矩阵，加权聚合LoRA输出。

Result: ClipScore提升1.3%，GPT-4V胜率72.43%，适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Motivation: 评估GPT-5和GPT-4o在乳腺X光筛查任务中的表现，探索通用大语言模型在临床影像辅助中的潜力。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上测试BI-RADS评估、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在各项任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光筛查中展现潜力，但需领域适配和优化才能用于高风险临床影像应用。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理方面的功能不如专有模型丰富，Thyme旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：初始SFT训练代码生成，随后RL阶段优化决策，并提出GRPO-ATS算法平衡推理探索与代码执行精度。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme在感知和复杂推理任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码生成和执行，成功扩展了MLLMs的能力，为开源模型提供了更丰富的功能。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: The development of porous polymeric membranes remains a labor-intensive
process, often requiring extensive trial and error to identify optimal
fabrication parameters. In this study, we present a fully automated platform
for membrane fabrication and characterization via nonsolvent-induced phase
separation (NIPS). The system integrates automated solution preparation, blade
casting, controlled immersion, and compression testing, allowing precise
control over fabrication parameters such as polymer concentration and ambient
humidity. The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible
handling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency.
Compression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization
method for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and
intra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As
a proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was
carried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the
polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively. Experiments conducted with the
automated system reproduced expected effects of polymer concentration and
ambient humidity on membrane properties, namely increased stiffness and
uniformity with increasing polymer concentration and humidity variations in
pore morphology and mechanical response. The developed automated platform
supports high-throughput experimentation and is well-suited for integration
into self-driving laboratory workflows, offering a scalable and reproducible
foundation for data-driven optimization of porous polymeric membranes through
NIPS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust online calibration framework for
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems
(VINS). Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial
for integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several
prior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems
to autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1)
these approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization
step, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness,
and 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the
UWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods
in real-world scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by explicitly
incorporating the impact of robot localization uncertainties into the
calibration process, ensuring robust initialization. To further enhance the
robustness of the calibration results against initialization errors, we propose
a tightly-coupled Schmidt Kalman Filter (SKF)-based online refinement method,
making the system suitable for practical applications. Simulations and
real-world experiments validate the improved accuracy and robustness of our
approach.

leverages 3D relative attention between action and visual tokens during action

performance. On the bimanual PerAct2 benchmark, it establishes a new state of
the art, outperforming the next-best method by an absolute margin of 41.4%. In
extensive real-world evaluations, it surpasses strong baselines with up to

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot
learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However,
these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with
fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While
video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains
constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of
collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address
these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from
generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables
learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using
low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks,
both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate
that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from
generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires robots to quickly infer user intent,
provide transparent reasoning, and assist users in achieving their goals. Our
recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and
manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model
(VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that
filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline
(YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance
segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their
relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object
labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing
navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant
targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a
threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the
desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in
the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using
a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing
environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for
modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable
asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical
trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear
model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with
geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs).
Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically
synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the
theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal
changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for
Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem.
Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a
configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our
real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various
safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson
safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive
safety-critical controllers.

Conclusion: AC3设计有效，适用于高维连续动作序列学习。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with long-horizon
robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those involving sparse rewards. While
action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to
directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner
remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for
Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate
high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process
stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms
for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy
improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning
exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value
learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using
intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module
providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We
conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench
benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple
model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks,
validating its effective design.

Result: 在模拟和真实手术环境中，GASv2成功率达65%，能泛化到未见对象和夹具。

Conclusion: GASv2展示了高性能、泛化性和鲁棒性，为手术自动化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and
automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety,
and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on
explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their
generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the
ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising
alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low
signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and
millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This
paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor
policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a
single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic
grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical
objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything
for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.
GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception
pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for
safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization
for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based
and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.
Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both
settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse
disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.

Conclusion: 非等距对称性结构能显著提升采样效率。

Abstract: Sampling efficiency is critical for deploying visuomotor learning in
real-world robotic manipulation. While task symmetry has emerged as a promising
inductive bias to improve efficiency, most prior work is limited to isometric
symmetries -- applying the same group transformation to all task objects across
all timesteps. In this work, we explore non-isometric symmetries, applying
multiple independent group transformations across spatial and temporal
dimensions to relax these constraints. We introduce a novel formulation of the
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the
non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data
augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate
MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and
introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational
equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two
manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NEEI范式为边缘智能和近场通信的联合优化提供了新方向，解决了传统方法无法应对的挑战。

Abstract: Realizing embodied artificial intelligence is challenging due to the huge
computation demands of large models (LMs). To support LMs while ensuring
real-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,
which leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to
embodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral
efficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user
interference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which
leverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an
ideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,
resulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces
new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC
designs, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both
functionalities. To this end, we propose radio-friendly embodied planning for
EEI-assisted NFC scenarios and view-guided beam-focusing for NFC-assisted EEI
scenarios. We also elaborate how to realize resource-efficient NEEI through
opportunistic collaborative navigation. Experimental results are provided to
confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques compared with various
benchmarks.

Abstract: Robotics research has long sought to give robots the ability to perceive the
physical world through touch in an analogous manner to many biological systems.
Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging
applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans.
Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to
the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and
piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical
tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction
methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities,
enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been
supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile
datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the
utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other
modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active
tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the
transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential.
In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the
current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to
inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing,
healthcare, recycling and agriculture.

Conclusion: 可微分可达性地图是一种有效的工具，可用于人形机器人运动生成的连续优化。

Abstract: To reduce the computational cost of humanoid motion generation, we introduce
a new approach to representing robot kinematic reachability: the differentiable
reachability map. This map is a scalar-valued function defined in the task
space that takes positive values only in regions reachable by the robot's
end-effector. A key feature of this representation is that it is continuous and
differentiable with respect to task-space coordinates, enabling its direct use
as constraints in continuous optimization for humanoid motion planning. We
describe a method to learn such differentiable reachability maps from a set of
end-effector poses generated using a robot's kinematic model, using either a
neural network or a support vector machine as the learning model. By
incorporating the learned reachability map as a constraint, we formulate
humanoid motion generation as a continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach efficiently solves various motion planning problems,
including footstep planning, multi-contact motion planning, and
loco-manipulation planning for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动重新规划有效预防执行失败，为机器人自主性提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on
the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put
something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,
many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow
pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,
which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and
eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most
existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be
inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for
preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually
designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive
replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries
by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against
reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current
scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning
module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments
in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and
spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving
task success and robustness.

Result: 仿真和实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RTLS方法在准确性和稳定性上优于伪线性卡尔曼滤波（PLKF）等现有方法。

Abstract: Bearing-only Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is a promising technique for
passive tracking in various applications as a bearing angle is easy to measure.
Despite its advantages, bearing-only TMA is challenging due to the nonlinearity
of the bearing measurement model and the lack of range information, which
impairs observability and estimator convergence. This paper addresses these
issues by proposing a Recursive Total Least Squares (RTLS) method for online
target localization and tracking using mobile observers. The RTLS approach,
inspired by previous results on Total Least Squares (TLS), mitigates biases in
position estimation and improves computational efficiency compared to
pseudo-linear Kalman filter (PLKF) methods. Additionally, we propose a
circumnavigation controller to enhance system observability and estimator
convergence by guiding the mobile observer in orbit around the target.
Extensive simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is
also compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, which confirms its superior
performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: EvoPSF通过在线进化机制有效提升了自动驾驶系统的适应性和规划准确性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in autonomous driving, with
systems evolving from modular pipelines to end-to-end architectures. However,
most existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new
environments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability
diminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.
In this paper, we break away from the conventional "train once, deploy forever"
paradigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous
driving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are
primarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such
failures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To
address this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,
using it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than
performing blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to
identify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are
primarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we
compute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints
from the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from
the perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then
backpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the
model's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion
predictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.
Experiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset
demonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under
challenging conditions.

Result: 训练样本复杂度降低33%，碰撞次数减少一半，在未见类别上性能与已见类别相当（40.1% SR，20.9% SPL）。

Conclusion: OVSegDT在无需深度、里程计或大型视觉语言模型的情况下，实现了开放词汇目标导航的先进性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach
objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during
training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets,
achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and
exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a
lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic
components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an
encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function,
grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second
component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample
scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals
according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches.
These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce
collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters,
RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen
categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1%
SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language
models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable navigation is crucial for autonomous unmanned ground

for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor
configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To
address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset
designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor
environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view
and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras,
odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial
measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate
timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and
offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale
sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets,
and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters.
High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is
derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a
navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more

Conclusion: 极坐标表示能更直观地建模动态环境中的相对关系，提升轨迹预测与规划的效果。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly
challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements
and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods
encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian
coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and
surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does
not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on
their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt
the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and
angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model
spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and
directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel
method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from
conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar
representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations
and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement
modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and
planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and
planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: 开发了Swarm in Blocks 2.0，进一步优化了用户友好的群管理功能。

Conclusion: 该工具不仅简化了无人机群控制，还扩展了编程教育的机会。

Abstract: Swarm in Blocks, originally developed for CopterHack 2022, is a high-level
interface that simplifies drone swarm programming using a block-based language.
Building on the Clover platform, this tool enables users to create
functionalities like loops and conditional structures by assembling code
blocks. In 2023, we introduced Swarm in Blocks 2.0, further refining the
platform to address the complexities of swarm management in a user-friendly
way. As drone swarm applications grow in areas like delivery, agriculture, and
surveillance, the challenge of managing them, especially for beginners, has
also increased. The Atena team developed this interface to make swarm handling
accessible without requiring extensive knowledge of ROS or programming. The
block-based approach not only simplifies swarm control but also expands
educational opportunities in programming.

Conclusion: 建立了一个可靠的基于学习的导航系统工作流程，为在极端环境中部署自主机器人迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant
planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However,
the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent
sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions
with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for
developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking
on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to
train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally
generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then
transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue
facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement
learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective
combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical
evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior
zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also
analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics,
which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational
cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating
reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards
deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Method: 系统评估常见参数化，提出SE(3)切空间的新方法。

Conclusion: 为敏捷运动生成提供了浮动基参数化选择的参考。

Abstract: Automatically generating agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid
robots remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While numerous trajectory
optimization approaches have been proposed, there is no clear guideline on how
the choice of floating-base space parameterization affects performance,
especially for agile behaviors involving complex contact dynamics. In this
paper, we present a comparative study of different parameterizations for direct
transcription-based trajectory optimization of agile motions in legged systems.
We systematically evaluate several common choices under identical optimization
settings to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
formulation based on the tangent space of SE(3) for representing the robot's
floating-base pose, which, to our knowledge, has not received attention from
the literature. This approach enables the use of mature off-the-shelf numerical
solvers without requiring specialized manifold optimization techniques. We hope
that our experiments and analysis will provide meaningful insights for
selecting the appropriate floating-based representation for agile whole-body
motion generation.

Motivation: 停车在高度受限空间中准确且安全地完成是一个关键挑战，现有模仿学习方法忽略了停车行为的多模态性，且存在因果混淆问题。

Method: 提出MultiPark，采用分段预测范式，分解停车查询为档位、纵向和横向组件，并使用目标中心位姿和自中心碰撞作为损失函数。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估，MultiPark表现优异，并在实际车辆上验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MultiPark通过多模态设计和因果混淆缓解，显著提升了停车性能，适用于复杂真实场景。

Abstract: Parking accurately and safely in highly constrained spaces remains a critical
challenge. Unlike structured driving environments, parking requires executing
complex maneuvers such as frequent gear shifts and steering saturation. Recent
attempts to employ imitation learning (IL) for parking have achieved promising
results. However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking
behavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible
solutions under the same situation. Notably, IL-based methods encompass
inherent causal confusion, so enabling a neural network to generalize across
diverse parking scenarios is particularly difficult. To address these
challenges, we propose MultiPark, an autoregressive transformer for multimodal
parking. To handle paths filled with abrupt turning points, we introduce a
data-efficient next-segment prediction paradigm, enabling spatial
generalization and temporal extrapolation. Furthermore, we design learnable
parking queries factorized into gear, longitudinal, and lateral components,
parallelly decoding diverse parking behaviors. To mitigate causal confusion in
IL, our method employs target-centric pose and ego-centric collision as
outcome-oriented loss across all modalities beyond pure imitation loss.
Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiPark achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. We deploy MultiPark on a
production vehicle, further confirming our approach's robustness in real-world
parking environments.

Result: 仿真显示性能接近真实测量（退化<6%），对负载参数变化具有强鲁棒性；户外实验验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架在仅使用现成硬件的情况下，实现了高效且可靠的负载位置跟踪。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a
cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on
real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many
existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard
cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only
standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation
satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement
unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the
full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a
linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring
control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control
architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and
estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth
measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong
robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further
validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable
performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle
hardware.

TL;DR: 比较自动多段控制与简化的一或两段预测喷雾切换方法，提出一种低成本、无传感器的优选方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动喷雾控制（ASC）因复杂性和高成本难以普及的问题，探索更简单的替代方案。

Method: 比较三种分段设置（48段、2段、单段）和两种路径规划与切换逻辑，在10个真实农田场景中评估。

Result: 优选方法在路径长度、重叠率和成本效益上表现最佳，适合手动驾驶且无需传感器。

Conclusion: 简化的一或两段控制方法在多数场景下可替代复杂ASC，实现低成本高效喷雾。

Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in
agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to
(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)
to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray
nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not
possible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying
and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In
addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,
boom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of
this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.
Therefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed
simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.
The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is
intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.
Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as
three sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by
controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with
the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10
diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours,
freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is
suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate
overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned
predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and
in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic
platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant
computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In
response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular
framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while
maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework
architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image
representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU
memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running
in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in
feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while
enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We
demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation
using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object
detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared
to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine
offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint
while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during
runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++
(Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse
robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time
performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized
models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过实时反馈提升了采摘操作的效率和可靠性，为农业自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective and efficient agricultural manipulation and harvesting depend on
accurately understanding the current state of the grasp. The agricultural
environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and
occlusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring
precise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and
modeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly
identifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely
inertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile
sensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp
states. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the
performance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest
classifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry
tomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and
successful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.
Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and
tension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier
enables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.

Result: 在Open-ML-CC18数据集上实验，性能优于现有加权方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效整合多种信息，提升集成模型的性能。

Abstract: Since the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI technology has been widely used in
many fields, but there are several limitations that need to be overcome,
including overfitting/underfitting, class imbalance, and the limitations of
representation (hypothesis space) due to the characteristics of different
models. As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as
model combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.
Among ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with
various weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the
existing methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights
consider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various
information that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this
paper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information
through cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,
various types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be
simultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight
distribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were
applied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble
weighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance
compared to other weighting methods.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable reasoning
capabilities across domains like code, math and other enterprise tasks, their
significant memory and computational costs often preclude their use in
practical enterprise settings. To this end, we introduce
Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter model in the ServiceNow

Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model is trained in a four stage training pipeline
including 1) Base Model upscaling, 2) Continual Pre-training 3) Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT) and 4) Reinforcement Learning using GRPO. Comprehensive
evaluations across a diverse suite of benchmarks consistently demonstrate that
our Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model matches or exceeds the performance of its
32-billion parameter counterparts, despite being less than half their size.

Motivation: 医疗领域的数据共享受伦理、社会和制度限制，传统集中式学习难以实现，且传统训练方法容易过拟合新样本或遗忘旧知识。数据分布的变化也增加了挑战。

Method: 采用基于提示的持续学习方法，通过统一提示池和最小扩展策略减少计算开销，并引入新的正则化项平衡知识保留和适应。

Conclusion: PCL方法有望推动可持续医疗AI发展，支持实时诊断、患者监测和远程医疗应用。

Abstract: Modern AI models achieve state-of-the-art performance with large-scale,
high-quality datasets; however, ethical, social, and institutional constraints
in the medical domain severely restrict data sharing, rendering centralized
learning nearly impossible. Each institution must incrementally update models
using only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers
from catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical
data distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and
demographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods
address natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We
propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified
prompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a
subset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel
regularization term balances retention and adaptation. Experiments on three
diabetic retinopathy datasets Aptos2019, LI2019, and Diabetic Retinopathy
Detection show our model improves final classification accuracy by at least 10%
and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering
inference cost. We anticipate this study will drive sustainable medical AI
advances, enabling real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine
applications in distributed healthcare. Code will be released upon acceptance

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction aims to infer the reactant molecule based on a
given product molecule, which is a fundamental task in chemical synthesis.
However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits
their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box
decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable
retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the
complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized
models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations
grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models
perform shallow reasoning to construct high-quality chemical decision space,
(2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding
interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing
interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only
surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but
also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI
predictions and actionable chemical insights.

Result: BeyondWeb在14项基准测试中平均提升5.1pp和2.6pp，训练速度更快，小模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据需多因素联合优化，BeyondWeb展示了其潜力，但需科学和实践结合。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开的预训练T2I模型虽促进了模型民主化，但用户面临选择最适合目标数据域的模型的挑战。

Method: M&C通过构建匹配图（包含模型和数据集节点及性能/相似性边），结合图嵌入特征预测最佳微调模型。

Result: 在10个T2I模型和32个数据集的测试中，M&C成功预测最佳模型的比例为61.3%，其余情况下也能预测接近最优的模型。

Conclusion: M&C有效解决了预训练T2I模型的选择问题，显著提升了模型选择的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures
advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared
on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI
applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I
models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I
models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new
challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?
Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known
in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target
domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,
which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model
platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The
core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available
models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs
capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We
then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,
critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,
predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target
domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets
against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the
best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model
for the rest.

Conclusion: CURE有效平衡探索与利用，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have
driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large
language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state
sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase
produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested
as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during
prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE
(Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a
two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically,
in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent
contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize
the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla
DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math
reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.
In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by
DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually
strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that,
compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six
math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and
accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

*Aakash Kumar,Emanuele Natale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过扩展强彩票假设（SLTH）到量化网络，证明了在有限精度下，目标离散神经网络可以被精确表示，并给出了初始网络过参数化的最优界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是提高神经网络效率的关键技术，但现有理论主要针对连续设置，无法直接应用于量化网络。

Method: 基于Borgs等人的数分割问题结果，推导了量化随机子集和问题的新理论，并扩展SLTH框架到有限精度网络。

Result: 在量化设置下，目标离散神经网络可以被精确表示，且初始网络的过参数化界限是最优的。

Conclusion: 研究填补了量化网络理论空白，为高效神经网络设计提供了新理论支持。

Abstract: Quantization is an essential technique for making neural networks more
efficient, yet our theoretical understanding of it remains limited. Previous
works demonstrated that extremely low-precision networks, such as binary
networks, can be constructed by pruning large, randomly-initialized networks,
and showed that the ratio between the size of the original and the pruned
networks is at most polylogarithmic.
  The specific pruning method they employed inspired a line of theoretical work
known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), which leverages insights
from the Random Subset Sum Problem. However, these results primarily address
the continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the
quantized setting.
  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number
Partitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset
Sum Problem in a quantized setting.
  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision
networks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of
a certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized
setting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be
represented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary
overparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of
the target network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的不确定性量化方法——zono-conformal预测，通过构建预测zonotopes提供统计有效的覆盖保证，解决了现有方法计算成本高和数据依赖性强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算昂贵且数据密集，且多维度输出依赖关系捕捉能力有限。

Method: 引入zono-conformal预测，基于区间预测模型和reachset-conformant识别，通过单一线性程序构建预测zonotopes。

Result: 实验表明，zono-conformal预测比现有方法更少保守，同时保持相似的测试数据覆盖。

Conclusion: zono-conformal预测为非线性基预测器提供高效、数据节约的不确定性量化解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that
augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid
coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally
expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model
before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the
prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture
dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by
introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval
predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs
prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty
sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors
can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can
apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we
focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression
tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification
settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible
classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for
detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical
experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than
interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while
achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

Method: 形式化学习中的信心，提出两种连续测量方法，并证明其普适性；在附加假设下，推导出更简洁的表示。

Result: 证明了信心可以统一表示，并扩展了复合观察的语言，贝叶斯规则是其特例。

Conclusion: 信心是学习中的独立概念，可通过统一框架表示，贝叶斯规则是其特殊情况。

Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating
beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on
the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is
easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a
different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the
literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's
weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to
learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a
continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way.
Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of
confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These
representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel"
observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing
learner whose loss representation is a linear expectation.

Result: 通过合成实验和真实数据验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 广义非正态正态分布为分析非高斯数据的条件独立性提供了新工具。

Abstract: For general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices
do not encode the independence structure of the variables, as they do for the
multivariate Gaussian. This paper builds on previous work to show that for a
class of non-Gaussian distributions -- those derived from diagonal
transformations of a Gaussian -- information about the conditional independence
structure can still be inferred from the precision matrix, provided the data
meet certain criteria, analogous to the Gaussian case. We call such
transformations of the Gaussian as the generalized nonparanormal. The functions
that define these transformations are, in a broad sense, arbitrary. We also
provide a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that leverages this
theory to recover conditional independence structure from the generalized
nonparanormal data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated
via synthetic experiments and applications to real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后解释方法（如LIME和SHAP）被广泛用于评估模型偏见，但它们容易被操纵，可能掩盖有害偏见。

Method: 通过复制COMPAS实验建立基线，引入模块化测试框架，评估增强和集成解释方法在不同性能分类器上的表现。

Result: 发现某些LIME/SHAP集成配置能显著提高偏见检测能力。

Conclusion: 这些改进方法有望提升高风险机器学习系统的透明度。

Abstract: Post hoc explanation methods, such as LIME and SHAP, provide interpretable
insights into black-box classifiers and are increasingly used to assess model
biases and generalizability. However, these methods are vulnerable to
adversarial manipulation, potentially concealing harmful biases. Building on
the work of Slack et al. (2020), we investigate the susceptibility of LIME and
SHAP to biased models and evaluate strategies for improving robustness. We
first replicate the original COMPAS experiment to validate prior findings and
establish a baseline. We then introduce a modular testing framework enabling
systematic evaluation of augmented and ensemble explanation approaches across
classifiers of varying performance. Using this framework, we assess multiple
LIME/SHAP ensemble configurations on out-of-distribution models, comparing
their resistance to bias concealment against the original methods. Our results
identify configurations that substantially improve bias detection, highlighting
their potential for enhancing transparency in the deployment of high-stakes
machine learning systems.

Result: 在真实微生物组分类任务中表现优于平均池化和未加权Set Transformer，部分任务达到完美性能。

Conclusion: 丰度感知聚合方法能提供更鲁棒且生物学信息丰富的微生物组表示，是首个将序列丰度整合到基于Transformer的样本嵌入中的方法之一。

Abstract: Microbiome sample representation to input into LLMs is essential for
downstream tasks such as phenotype prediction and environmental classification.
While prior studies have explored embedding-based representations of each
microbiome sample, most rely on simple averaging over sequence embeddings,
often overlooking the biological importance of taxa abundance. In this work, we
propose an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer to construct
fixed-size sample-level embeddings by weighting sequence embeddings according
to their relative abundance. Without modifying the model architecture, we
replicate embedding vectors proportional to their abundance and apply
self-attention-based aggregation. Our method outperforms average pooling and
unweighted Set Transformers on real-world microbiome classification tasks,
achieving perfect performance in some cases. These results demonstrate the
utility of abundance-aware aggregation for robust and biologically informed
microbiome representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the
first approaches to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based
sample embeddings.

Result: 离线和在线实验均显示，该方法在推荐准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了观看时间偏差问题，提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video
recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by
confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user
behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased
recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing
framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived
reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach
yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage
architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference
learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently
parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage
of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing
baseline methods.

Conclusion: 压缩元学习框架显著提升了压缩学习的性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast
and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a
framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear
features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving
representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples
and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level
summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying
data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an
efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding
and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing
to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a
framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive
learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate
systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the
potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore
multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA,
compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works
have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early
forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,
suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address
the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the
beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical
notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model
integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to
learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at
every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that
adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these
strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: 结合多模态特征、分层图结构和注意力机制能显著提升个性化时尚推荐系统的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of
products have made it challenging for users to find compatible items on
e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for
filtering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,
simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations
remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated
independently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions
between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework
named FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks
and graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework
constructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,
integrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit
compatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically
weights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture
of key interactions and generating precise representations for both user
preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT
outperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in
precision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that
combining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph
structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and
efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.

Abstract: Optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables are very
challenging in general due to the combinatorial nature of their search space.
Piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) provides a flexible modeling and
computational framework for quantization based on continuous optimization. In
this work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the
theoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives.
First, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of
parameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the
PAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second,
we derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and
non-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the
proximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of
PAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate
classical formulations of $\ell_1$-, squared $\ell_2$-, and nonconvex
regularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with
quantized solutions.

Motivation: 在机器学习任务中，数据通常来自多个不同来源，需要预测不仅整体准确，还能在各来源内保持可靠并保留差异。

Method: 提出Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL)，结合跨域残差学习和自适应池化/聚类。

Result: CTRL在5个大规模数据集上表现优于其他基准方法，包括瑞士国家庇护计划的数据集。

Conclusion: CTRL能有效平衡数据数量和质量，适用于多源数据场景。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) tasks often utilize large-scale data that is drawn from
several distinct sources, such as different locations, treatment arms, or
groups. In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only
exhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and
preserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several
asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment
predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host
country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions
for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made
challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:
the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between
them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper
introduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method
that combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive
pooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and
preserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that
clarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and
data quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5
large-scale datasets. This includes a dataset from the national asylum program
in Switzerland, where the algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers
is currently being piloted. CTRL consistently outperforms the benchmarks across
several key metrics and when using a range of different base learners.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data
classification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,
and great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data
sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order
feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the
occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose
a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning
distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in
word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional
representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different
features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which
then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new
test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence
Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,
NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn
distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the
conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic
gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model
efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing
high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional
Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,
including two neural network based classifiers without distributional
representation learning.

Conclusion: QQR算法能有效解决多模态在线联邦学习中的模态不平衡问题，提升学习性能。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem produces massive volumes of multimodal
data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and microphones. With
advances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data
acquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized
processing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates
distributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data.
Furthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage
capacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online
Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these
requirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent
instability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and
quality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically
investigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a
comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance
degrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the
Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning
based method designed to operate in parallel with the training process.
Extensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the
proposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality
imbalance conditions with promising learning performance.

Result: 在图像和多组学数据上，模型在预测和填补缺失视图方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为多视图学习提供了一种有效解决方案，尤其在标签有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple
omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing
labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by
using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present
views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using
the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is
inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work,
we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and
unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood
of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled
data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent
space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to
existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation
performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited
labeled samples.

<details>

Motivation: 传统深度学习依赖高斯先验，难以捕捉复杂数据的非高斯特性，尤其在生物数据中表现不佳。量子方法因计算资源限制未能广泛应用。

Method: 提出QBM-VAE，一种混合量子-经典架构，利用量子处理器高效采样玻尔兹曼分布，作为生成模型的先验。

Conclusion: QBM-VAE展示了量子计算在深度学习中的实际优势，为混合量子AI模型提供了可推广的蓝图。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant
reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from
accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,
particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely
hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The
physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive
alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To
date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and
operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.
Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann
Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable
hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum
processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its
use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to
million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates
a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,
consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models
like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type
classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of
introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire
scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This
work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep
learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable
blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于调制的元学习框架，用于结构保持的动态系统建模，无需显式系统参数知识即可适应新参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构保持方法需要固定系统配置和显式参数知识，限制了其在多查询或参数变化场景中的应用。

Method: 引入调制策略，将结构保持模型直接与潜在参数表示结合，避免优化过程中的不稳定性和泛化能力限制。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在少样本学习场景下实现了准确预测，同时保持了物理约束和泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为参数化动态系统提供了可扩展和通用的学习方法，适用于未知参数场景。

Abstract: Structure-preserving approaches to dynamics modeling have demonstrated great
potential for modeling physical systems due to their strong inductive biases
that enforce conservation laws and dissipative behavior. However, the resulting
models are typically trained for fixed system configurations, requiring
explicit knowledge of system parameters as well as costly retraining for each
new set of parameters -- a major limitation in many-query or parameter-varying
scenarios. Meta-learning offers a potential solution, but existing approaches
like optimization-based meta-learning often suffer from training instability or
limited generalization capability. Inspired by ideas from computer vision, we
introduce a modulation-based meta-learning framework that directly conditions
structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially
unknown system parameters, avoiding the need for gray-box system knowledge and
explicit optimization during adaptation. Through the application of novel
modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems,
we enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of
dynamical systems. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that
our approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings,
without compromising on the essential physical constraints necessary for
dynamical stability and effective generalization performance across parameter
space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期儿科风险评估的准确性通常较低，但临床需求迫切，因此需要改进早期预测性能。

Method: 提出BFF框架，将不同时间窗口视为不同模态，通过对比学习从后期数据中借用信息来监督早期学习。

Result: 在两个真实儿科预测任务中验证，BFF显著提升了早期风险评估的准确性。

Conclusion: BFF框架有效提升了早期儿科风险评估的性能，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Risk assessments for a pediatric population are often conducted across
multiple stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at
birth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages
typically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable
risk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on
improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,
\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal
framework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model
is trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk
assessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the
model to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child
visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g.,
prenatal/birth stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome
prediction tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in early risk
assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/scotsun/bff.

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over
representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given
computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We
argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal
abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current
discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how
classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in
contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational
implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for
representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most
profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

Method: 使用CNN提取局部空间特征，LSTM建模时间序列依赖，基于北京工业区2010-2015年的多元数据预测6小时平均PM2.5浓度。

Result: 模型RMSE为5.236，优于传统时间序列模型，展示了在空气污染预警系统中的潜力。

Conclusion: 模型计算资源需求高，对多元大气因素处理能力需优化，未来将提升可扩展性和支持更复杂的天气预测任务。

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air
quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly
important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban
management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction
model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in
time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial
area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5
concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,
and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over
6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean
square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in
both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in
real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,
due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high
computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors
still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability
and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the Interactive Voting-Based Map

extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements
also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting
strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to
address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a
custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be
smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road
network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original
algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: GODNF为扩散GNN提供了高效、可解释且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms
in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from
three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static
dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is
constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3)
theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To
address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics
Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a
principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous
diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling
and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable
message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence
configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and
influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art
GNNs.

Result: 在五个数据集上展示了优于传统方法的准确性与公平性权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架数据高效，适用于开放和封闭权重LLM，优于从头训练或基于嵌入的方法。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot
or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building
prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM
capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of
domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing
disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of
existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely
on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on
final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs
under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable
commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we
propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via
prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited
from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using
prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain
sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied
to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.
Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong
accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from
both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is
data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings
(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间结构在对抗学习中的重要性，为构建鲁棒的SNN模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for
energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit
the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,
treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete
timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored
challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency
for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training
framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the
temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both
objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for
efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in
robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the
internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally
diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of
temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation
for building robust spiking models.

Result: 实验验证了模型在转导和归纳学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: HS-GPPT通过谱对齐实现高效知识迁移，适用于不同同质性图。

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with
pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited
supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency
knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world
graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral
specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between
pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.
Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and
downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose
the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout
both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter
backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral
knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with
pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and
heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both
transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework
specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by
explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of
static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS
features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search
space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2)
specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range
blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss
function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching,
transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability
constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across
multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous
empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates
that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving
an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional
recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs).
Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution
of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This
work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as
market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive
models for challenging financial applications.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，TACP和sTACP能有效减少头尾覆盖差距，提升覆盖平衡。

Conclusion: TACP和sTACP在长尾数据集上表现优异，能显著改善尾部类别的覆盖问题。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
that converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with
the set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods
are guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced
coverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over
cover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail
classes. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the
reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage
ensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal
Prediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by
utilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap.
Theoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail
coverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across
all classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a
reweighting mechanism. The proposed framework can be combined with various
non-conformity scores, and experiments on multiple long-tail benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Result: 实验表明，NeMo在模块分类准确率上平均提升1.72%，模块大小减少58.10%，适用于CNN和Transformer模型。

Conclusion: NeMo为DNN模块化提供了一种可扩展且通用的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into
modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a
significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training
costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant
inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention,
enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging
modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization
into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,
existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional
kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,
particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose
NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron
level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to
Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based
modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling
scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two
Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets
demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show
average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction
in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale
Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's
potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for
scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

Abstract: Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate
change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these
efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through
processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data
reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of
voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation
and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and
augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our
dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years.
Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a
planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized
assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize
in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity
Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites
monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the
monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place.
In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the
presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer
vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope
satellite images.

Conclusion: HGD是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于任何使用梯度下降的模型，能有效解决数据流中的类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Many real-world data are sequentially collected over time and often exhibit
skewed class distributions, resulting in imbalanced data streams. While
existing approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and
reweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself
by addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly
focusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient
descent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across
different classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates
under-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,
HGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,
extra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning
models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based
on a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied
sub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly
used online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream
scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了推理效率、多样性和估计鲁棒性，推动了无监督强化学习在开放域推理任务中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant
improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming.
However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit
limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations,
test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables
self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its
promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due
to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters
overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To
address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance
the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning
through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and
Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our
approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in
Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of
the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively
optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation
robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for
open-domain reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental
challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial
inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant
representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant
Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG
decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism
that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns,
enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while
extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized
across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of
dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address
representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints
that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and
subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a
multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and
disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor
imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot
generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled
neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable
decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.

TL;DR: DFA是一种强化学习算法，结合个体奖励和成对偏好，通过直接使用策略的对数概率建模偏好概率，避免了单独的奖励建模步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法通常依赖个体奖励信号，而DFA旨在融合额外的偏好信息（如人类标注或合成偏好）以提升性能。

Method: DFA通过策略的对数概率直接建模偏好概率，支持人类标注或在线合成的偏好数据，并在Bradley-Terry模型下优化偏好损失。

Result: 实验表明，DFA在六种控制环境中表现优于或匹配SAC，训练更稳定；在半合成偏好数据下，其性能超过RLHF基线。

Conclusion: DFA通过融合奖励和偏好信息，显著提升了强化学习算法的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that
fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a
single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model
the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step.
Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or
trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an
off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing
DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences
matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more
stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under
Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and
approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

TL;DR: 决策聚焦学习（DFL）通过优化问题参数预测直接最小化决策后悔，提出使用替代损失函数提升梯度信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性规划（LP）中梯度几乎为零的问题，提升决策质量。

Method: 提出最小化替代损失函数，结合高效的可微分优化技术DYS-Net。

Result: 实验显示替代损失函数方法在决策后悔和训练时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 替代损失函数结合DYS-Net能高效实现最优决策后悔，显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to
predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision
regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing
the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the
predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear
programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted
parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches
for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP
into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer
and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that
have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former
approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the
regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address
this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable
optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our
experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable
optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than
surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds
for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,
that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can
be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes
the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate
losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the
state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

Motivation: 现实世界中的复杂系统（如社交或生物网络）通常需要更高阶的拓扑表示，而传统图神经网络难以处理此类结构。

Method: 利用Forman-Ricci曲率定义边基网络特性，通过结构提升将数据表示从基本图形式转换为更具表达力的拓扑结构。

Result: 该方法能够揭示图的局部和全局特性（如网络骨干），并通过超边建模信息流，缓解信息失真问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了图学习中长距离信息传递的过压缩问题，为高阶拓扑表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks are highly effective at learning from relational data,
leveraging node and edge features while maintaining the symmetries inherent to
graph structures. However, many real-world systems, such as social or
biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally
represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of
Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing
methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL
is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic
graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models
for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using
Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic
based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of
a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph
geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably
represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across
large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to
the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances
and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.

TL;DR: CHORD框架通过动态加权统一SFT和RL，避免破坏模型模式并减少过拟合，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法整合SFT和RL时可能破坏模型模式并过拟合专家数据，需一种统一视角的动态加权方法。

Method: 提出CHORD框架，将SFT作为动态加权辅助目标融入RL过程，采用全局系数和令牌级加权函数。

Result: 实验表明CHORD实现了稳定高效的学习过程，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CHORD有效统一了离策略专家数据与在策略探索，为后续研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two
prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning
the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that
integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model
patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a
novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy
versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable
Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic
Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically
weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an
analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular
levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the
framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the
transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies
a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert
tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from
off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,
providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient
learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with
on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over
baselines. We release the implementation at
https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to
inspire further research.

Motivation: 现有方法在原始数据空间中优化抗体CDR区域，导致搜索效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 提出LEAD框架，在共享潜在空间中优化序列和结构，并设计黑盒指导策略以适应非可微分评估器。

Result: LEAD在单目标和多目标优化中表现优异，查询成本减半且性能超越基线方法。

Conclusion: LEAD通过潜在空间优化和黑盒策略，显著提升了抗体设计的效率和效果。

Abstract: Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of
antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context.
However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space,
leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search
process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a
sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and
structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can
not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure
synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a
black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many
property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate
that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and
multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half
while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is
available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design.

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上验证了对抗噪声和攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 收缩性NODEs能有效提升模型鲁棒性，且正则化方法计算高效。

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by
dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their
robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different
initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight
perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term
involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted
using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with
slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark
image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are
corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Conclusion: mCOCO为功能连接研究提供了一种高效、可解释且具有认知建模能力的新方法。

Abstract: The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered
significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity
patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning
such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are
hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due
to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive
focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the
generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory
COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)
to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD
(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow
for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling
the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By
integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO
captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process
information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a
computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:
(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional
connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to
the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity
studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive
reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show
that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms
of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory
memory retention. Our source code is available at
https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.

Result: 证明许多流行算法在复杂模型中无效，并提出了改进条件。

Conclusion: 解释算法的有效性需更强条件，对AI审计和高风险应用有重要影响。

Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that local post-hoc explanation algorithms
can be used to gain insights into the behavior of complex machine learning
models. However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for
simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which
assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we
introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an
explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an
explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of
plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular
explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision
functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it
should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which
different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger
than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and
counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of
differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative
with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss
how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the
proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it
holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms,
particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.

Result: 所有算法在校准性上表现良好，但深度学习算法在分布外数据的不确定性估计上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为开发新的不确定性估计方法提供了参考，强调了深度学习算法在分布外数据上的局限性。

Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with
accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery,
especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such
as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly
difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study,
we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with
empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to
investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine
learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a
neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss,
(iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo
Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process
mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which
reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and
exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our
results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep
learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack
of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study
may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of
uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

Abstract: Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide,
necessitating data-driven approaches to understand and mitigate crash severity.
This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved
in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3
million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution
is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and
interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio
AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between
severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature
selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were
interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the
contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model
achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test
set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential
predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human,
and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum
occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized
factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final
model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing
methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance,
this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned
interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.

Abstract: Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to
ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced
self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving
both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and
PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward
class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on
instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these
prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this
paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework
designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model
jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that
are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that
captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies
efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation
strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior
methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our
results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior
fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph
classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the
computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo
Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and
lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training.
These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for
faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

Conclusion: 双空间引导框架显著提升了测试场景的多样性和关键性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments
increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario
generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively
balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing
methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional
scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided
testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior
space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and
criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical
representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and
multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and
critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation
modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario
quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,
agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral
criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming
a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and
exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves
critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater
diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five
decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep,
non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be
computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the
training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training
such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite
width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian
statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing
finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the
necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise
recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and
certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the
training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations
to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant
nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We
validate our results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a
physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the
past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting,
imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In
this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent
temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted
physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted
physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This
approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data
distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection
performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it
generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms
baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and
purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world
dataset while remaining competitive on others.

TL;DR: HXAI框架通过整合数据、分析设置、学习过程、模型输出、模型质量和沟通渠道六个组件，提供端到端的可解释AI解决方案，旨在增强透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释AI方法仅关注单个预测的解释，忽视了上下游决策和质量检查，导致用户对AI模型的信任不足。

Method: 提出HXAI框架，结合人类解释理论、人机交互原则和用户研究，设计了一个包含112个问题的问卷，并分析了现有工具的覆盖差距。

Result: HXAI通过统一分类法和AI代理（如大语言模型）协调多种解释技术，生成针对不同利益相关者的解释，提升透明度和信任。

Conclusion: HXAI为端到端的透明、可信和负责任AI部署提供了新视角，弥合了开发者与领域专家之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users
still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable
artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the
upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether
insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds
explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those
explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,
learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a
single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,
data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;
our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in
theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and
findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that
make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive
taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and
enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further
demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate
diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into
stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and
domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,
this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world
projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,
end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFed-SST是一种去中心化联邦图学习框架，通过自适应通信机制优化客户端间的拓扑结构，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化联邦学习（DFL）方法未考虑局部子图的拓扑信息，而联邦图学习（FGL）多为集中式，缺乏去中心化优势。

Method: 提出DFed-SST框架，采用双拓扑自适应通信机制，动态优化客户端间通信拓扑。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，平均准确率提升3.26%。

Conclusion: DFed-SST有效解决了异构性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed
paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication
bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge
arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks
such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information
inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL)
is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized
server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To
bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning
framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a
dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique
topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct
and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework
to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive
experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the
superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over
baseline methods.

Motivation: 利用降阶空间中的层次结构，优先考虑主导模式的相互作用，以构建更优的初始猜测。

Result: 在立方热传导问题中，误差比标准方法小四倍；在格陵兰冰盖模型中，误差为3%，计算加速超过19,000倍。

Conclusion: 嵌套OpInf方法在误差和计算效率上显著优于标准方法，适用于大规模参数化模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach
for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of
high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent
hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for
the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant
modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds
to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with
standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from
previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving
dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a
four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time.
Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the
Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a
ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

TL;DR: SeamlessFlow是一个基于服务器的强化学习框架，解决了工业级RL中的训练与执行解耦和GPU利用率最大化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级RL面临训练与复杂执行流程耦合及GPU利用率低的挑战。

Method: 引入数据平面解耦训练与代理执行，采用标签驱动调度和时空复用管道优化资源利用。

Result: 实现了高吞吐、稳定性和可扩展性，适用于多代理和复杂任务。

Conclusion: SeamlessFlow结合创新设计，适合大规模RL部署。

Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1)
decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2)
maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the
stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First,
SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from
diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A
central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and
supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and
resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we
propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into
capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated
architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal
multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout
in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully
exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations,
SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well
suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

Conclusion: 协作联盟结构在CCS项目中更优，强化学习方法为多利益相关者管理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array
of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each
with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale,
and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual
stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether
collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for
effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often
implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features
such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive
behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located
in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon
extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing
infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and
unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively
investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of
stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a
multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our
approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety
regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2
into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To
address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity
models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control
(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when
multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.
