This vision\nincludes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human\ncollaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional\nInteractive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the\nlanguage they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language\nmodels (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language\nunderstanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with\nrobots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.\n  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that\nwork closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better\ncollaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system\nwith a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts\nwith both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its\nexperiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three\nspecific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and\npresent a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each.

To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective.

The inter-context self-attention mechanism\nis proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding\nVRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context\nscheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further\nfacilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.\nExtensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to\n18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling\ngeneric VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and\nachieves the best performance for most VRPs."}

However, most automated methods estimate\nlandmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even\nsmall shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant\nmeasurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent\nsemi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining\nlandmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated\nAnatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To\nenable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in\nthis work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised\nB-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV\nlong axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this\nfoundation, we introduce \\textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet\nmanually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then\nautomatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.\n\\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the\nmotion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the\npotential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application."}

This effect arises from the coupling between\nstate-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space\ndynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for\nleaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes\nexplicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient\npropagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in\nparameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory\nretention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners\nthat adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal\nanalogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as\nAdam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.\nNumerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,\nsupporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting\nsystematic effects on training dynamics.

In this paper, we propose a motion-based\ntemporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric\nmulti-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets.\nOur method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event\ncameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from\nconventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method\nefficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are\nderived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration\npipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset\nand rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and\nrotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a\ncontinuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both\npublicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed\nmethod achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while\nexhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting\nits precision, robustness and flexibility.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens.

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with\nvarying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14%\nAUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods\nunder limited-label settings."}

Traditional methods, which treat\nnavigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such\n'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before\nnavigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required\nto clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the\nmanipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based\napproach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent\nnavigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on\nhigh manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting\nhigh-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful\nactions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to\nlearn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new\nmanipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston\nDynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good\nhand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively\nforward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires\nthe robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of\nthese tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward.\nResults show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and\ntraverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a\nreal Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task."}

However, few studies are concerned with the\ndamage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with\npixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel\nWeather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of\n14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding\nground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm\ngeneralization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and\na real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean\nimages, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we\npropose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network\n(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.\nSpecifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep\nfeatures, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted\nfrom the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons\nagainst 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on\nWXSOD.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our\napproach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation\nthat semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics\nthan holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This\ndesign not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances\nadaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel\nasymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific\nfactor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized\nheads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local\nadaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel\ncommonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation\nthat is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with\nadaptability.

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing\nmodels that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure.

Its substantial\nperformance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes\nto the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching\nformulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three\narchitecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:\nself-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3\nachieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit\nhydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and\ngeometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer\nlearnable parameters than comparable methods.

To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal\nChain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a\njoint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning\nstate is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and\naligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective\ncognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language\nmodel`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,\nand MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on\nbenchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently\nimproves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong\nbaselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and\nopen-ended tasks.

(2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized\nin expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities.\nAlthough predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in\nreality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth\nis not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known\ncalibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more\ncalibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et\nal. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful\ncalibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly\ntruthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch\nsetting.\n  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:\naveraged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is\nsound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing\ncalibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)\ndistance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB\nmakes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation\nalgorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,\nachieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing\nproblem studied by Hu et al.

We also introduce a general recipe for\nconstructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a\nspecial case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures\nsuch as quantile-binned l_2-ECE."}

Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves\nnotable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,\nVizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing\nexpected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text\nassociations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results\nprovide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not\nnecessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning\ntasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces\ncomputational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about\nmodality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal\narchitectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

In\nself-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based\nreconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the\nskeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.\nHowever, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion\npatterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.\nTo address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking\nmethod for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel\nframework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of\njoints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal\norgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore\nmore discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order\nmotion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order\nmotion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion\nacceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach\noffers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,\nenhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns.

However, the input-specific prompts\nrequired for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to\ntrain a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.\nOur approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces\nhallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static\nbaselines."}

Although training data are collected from\ndiverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses\nwithin the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies.\nTo mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA)\nframework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation\nspace. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms\nend-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera\ncoordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous\nviewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment\nbetween perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to\ncamera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with\nexisting VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications.\nComprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation\ntasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success\nrates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly\navailable."}
