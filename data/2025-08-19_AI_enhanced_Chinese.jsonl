This vision\nincludes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human\ncollaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional\nInteractive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the\nlanguage they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language\nmodels (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language\nunderstanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with\nrobots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.\n  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that\nwork closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better\ncollaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system\nwith a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts\nwith both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its\nexperiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three\nspecific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and\npresent a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally,\nwe discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an\noperational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an\nintegrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ITL\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96c6\u6210\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709\u5546\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLMs\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1ChatGPT\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a9\u624b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation.

Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural\ncompleteness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF\nreduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated\nacceptability exceeding 94%.

This informed model is subsequently refined in a\nparallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that\nweights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine\nsimilarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the\nconverged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average\ntest accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming\npersonalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and\nmechanical fault datasets, respectively.

HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight\ntraining and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to\ncommunication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve\nUFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal\nmethod addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On\nthe server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data\ndistribution across clients.

Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of\nthe generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,\nthus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not\napplicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on\ninaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation\nerrors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing\nresources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we\npropose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).\nSince allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content\naccuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this\nsensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource\ntradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all\nusers with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC).

For\nproduct understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures\ndrive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one\nalignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue\nthat generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant\npotential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,\nachieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:\nthe lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the\ncommon presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a\nstandard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the\nfirst generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation\nlearning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for\ntargeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)\neffectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the\ndistraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the\nspecialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity\nof negative samples.

Predicting and\nmanaging oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of\nphysical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and\ntemperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate\nreal-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for\nminimizing the impact of these disasters.

The proposed system\nfuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling\nreal-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil\nspills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent\nprocesses--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill\nmovement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient\ndecision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and\ncontainment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater\nHorizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy,\nsurpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling\nwith autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in\nprediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability.

However, most automated methods estimate\nlandmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even\nsmall shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant\nmeasurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent\nsemi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining\nlandmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated\nAnatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To\nenable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in\nthis work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised\nB-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV\nlong axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this\nfoundation, we introduce \\textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet\nmanually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then\nautomatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.\n\\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the\nmotion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the\npotential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aWiseLVAM\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u653e\u7f6e\u865a\u62df\u626b\u63cf\u7ebf\uff08SL\uff09\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408B\u6a21\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548cAMM\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728B\u6a21\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002EnLVAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684SL\u4e0a\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6e\u5ed3\u611f\u77e5\u7684SL\u653e\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763B\u6a21\u5f0f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u65adLV\u957f\u8f74\u548c\u57fa\u5e95\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86WiseLVAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408B\u6a21\u5f0f\u548cAMM\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "WiseLVAM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u4e14\u53ef\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u5730\u8fdb\u884cSL\u653e\u7f6e\u548cLV\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WiseLVAM\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e38\u89c4\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Different from\nconventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method\nefficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are\nderived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration\npipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset\nand rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and\nrotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a\ncontinuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both\npublicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed\nmethod achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while\nexhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting\nits precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our\nimplementation will be made open-source.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance.

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data.

At inference\ntime, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no\nretraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving\nthe accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen\nLLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSCR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5feb\u901f\u9009\u62e9\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\u8bd5\u9519\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "CSCR\u4f7f\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684logit\u8db3\u8ff9\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6307\u7eb9\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u7ecf\u6d4e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCSCR\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534725%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "CSCR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u3002"}}

However, classical LRTR-based methods face\ntwo critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is\nlow-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with\nsignificant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete\nmeshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our\napproach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation\nthat semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics\nthan holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This\ndesign not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances\nadaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel\nasymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific\nfactor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized\nheads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local\nadaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel\ncommonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation\nthat is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with\nadaptability.

To address this\nlimitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond\nto user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information\nof regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose\nRegion-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which\nincorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to\nutilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual\ncontent with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we\nintroduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset\nthat covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\\&P-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal\npersonalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free\nevaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the\nregion-level context-aware image descriptions.

Through case studies using coding agents to\ntackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides\nvaluable insights into the iterative coding process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9ML\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u7ea7\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u548cLLM\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing research has mostly\nfocused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how\nto interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of\ncapturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and\nthe target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is\ncrucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic\nmotion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction\nlocalization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,\nbut suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although\ncurrent temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting\nverb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training\nand exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation\nmoments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed\nEgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric\nvideos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate\nhigh-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify\ncontact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide\nclosed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for\nobject masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot\nimplementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel\nbenchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric\nvideos.

Subject-specific ER can benefit\nsignificantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each\ndomain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and\nrobustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often\noverlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting\nsubject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific\ncharacteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a\nmulti-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on\nco-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities\nand multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo\nparticularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,\nsuch as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level\nnuances are crucial.

To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal\nChain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a\njoint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning\nstate is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and\naligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective\ncognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language\nmodel`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,\nand MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on\nbenchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently\nimproves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong\nbaselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and\nopen-ended tasks.

We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD\noutperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning\naccuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a\nreal-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task,\nconfirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViLaD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u5e8f\u5217\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cViLaD\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u6545\u969c\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "ViLaD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first\nframework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of\nindividuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a\ncoarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust\ncrowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and\nsevere occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based\nhuman motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The\ncore of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term\ndynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals\nwith similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous\nMotion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion\nsegments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and\nplausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization\nand rhythmic inconsistencies.

Threat Modeling, that is,\ncomprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support\nto cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and\nallocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily\ndependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and\nmitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,\nthere has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack\ndescriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity\nof cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\ndeep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by\nleveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration\n(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five\nprincipal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,\nand Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical\nAttention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their\nperformance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.\nExperimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,\nfar higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label\nclassification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on\nspecific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better\nprecision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences\nof a cyberattack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528NLP\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fBERT\u548cHAN\uff09\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0cBERT\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\u63cf\u8ff0\u9884\u6d4b\u540e\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BERT\u548cHAN\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "BERT\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.972\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff1bHAN\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "BERT\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate the impact\nof the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this\nend, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA\nto specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport\nutility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant\ncross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model\narchitecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the\none hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View\n(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most\nrobust against varying sensor configurations.

Levine", "Matthew Berger"], "title": "Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates", "comment": null, "summary": "Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to\ntraditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the\nusability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing\nfeature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three\nsimulation datasets.

(2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful\ncalibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly\ntruthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch\nsetting.\n  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:\naveraged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is\nsound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing\ncalibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)\ndistance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB\nmakes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation\nalgorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,\nachieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing\nproblem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for\nconstructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a\nspecial case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures\nsuch as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aATB\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4f1a\u6fc0\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6492\u8c0e\u4ee5\u663e\u5f97\u66f4\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86ATB\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u4e24\u7bb1\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "ATB\u4e0d\u4ec5\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6613\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "ATB\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u6279\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We study whether such\nreasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual\nand temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,\ndespite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its\nreliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial\nRepresentations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative\nsampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate\ntemporal reasoning.

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO.

These views share a single ground truth (GT),\nforming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders\nadvanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as\nthey are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image\nis independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error\naccumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.\nTo address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented\nperspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency\nAugmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent\nconsistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented\nbaseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,\nwe introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency\nrepresentation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module\n(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware\nview through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module\n(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information\ninteraction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe\nmaterials.

However, several key issues remain. For example, existing\nmethods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in\nthe number of style images that can be used.

To address this, we propose leveraging\nmultiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent\ncontent leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both\nimage prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the\ndenoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can\nintervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the\ndenoising UNet.

These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge\nof VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting\nthrough parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints.\nHowever, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data\ndistribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic\nrepresentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning\nmethod, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the\ndata distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning\nexplicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further\nsculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves\nboth macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original\nmanifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.\nTheoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the\nGromov-Wasserstein distance.

The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to\nmitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D\nconvolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point\naware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from\nLiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal\nrefinement stage.

Although\nrecent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,\nand no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability\nto evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using\nlayout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and\ndegrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to\nassess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image\ngeneration.

In\nself-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based\nreconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the\nskeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.\nHowever, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion\npatterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.\nTo address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking\nmethod for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations.

Current approaches, such as factorized attention and\nfixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal\nredundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion\ntransformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit\nstructured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads\ndynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,\ncross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods\neither impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a\nhardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive\ntiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via\ndynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity\nlevels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search\nalgorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention\npathways.

This\npaper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object\ntracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,\nMMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,\nmodality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.\nAccordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,\nlaying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a\ndiscussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and\nannotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on\ndifferent ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the\nauxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental\nconfigurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth\n(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part\nof the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an\nomni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),\ncovering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we\ndiscuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always\nguaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of\ninformation fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is\nbeneficial.

The primary obstacle lies in the inherent\ntopological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts\nthe establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,\nthe current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different\ntopological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven\napproaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,\ntraining-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only\none or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set\nof bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that\nMotion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both\nsimilar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical\nutility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in\ndownstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for\nindustrial applications.

Our method constructs segmentation\naware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic\nconsistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a\npseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative\nco-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity\nrendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or\ncomplex pipelines.
