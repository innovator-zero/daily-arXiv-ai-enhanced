However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters\nand high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC\nframework that introduces dual-mode optimization - combining architectural\nredesign and operational refinement - to reduce complexity whilst preserving\nreconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3\nconvolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity\nwithout compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a\ntwo-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training\nidentifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning\npermanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This\ndual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode\noptimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%\ncomputation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video\nCoding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the\nproposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in\nresource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices."}

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected.

Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

Current research of a\ndataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method\n\\cite{carlsson}. In \\cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was\nintroduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological\nspaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology\nperspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets\nare assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using\nopen sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types\nand its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate\nthe inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,\nin which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.\nThose components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer\nsequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be\nwell represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such\nstructures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as\ncalculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection."}

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images.
