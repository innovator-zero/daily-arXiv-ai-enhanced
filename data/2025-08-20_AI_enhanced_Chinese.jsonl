Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle\nmodel parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized\nmusculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring\nthe internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint\ntorques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model\n(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an\nend-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the\nmeasurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting\nobservable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.\nThrough extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our\nproposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters\n(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the\nground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end\nup with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as\n0.05%).

Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of\nmotion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based\ndominance check.

Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones.

A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to\nnavigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,\ncorridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and\nhumans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc\nrepresentation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting\nto start research in this area.

In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this\nprocess by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,\nenabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base\nattack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models\nacross CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on\nLp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nperceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates\n(e.g., 20.63\\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,\nLPIPS, and FID (improvements $\\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).\nFurthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical\nand strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted\nadaptive attacks for each new defense.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAASH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u5143\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u73b0\u6709Lp\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Lp\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528Lp\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DAASH\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u805a\u5408\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5143\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet\u4e0a\uff0cDAASH\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DAASH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Hill"], "title": "Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot", "comment": null, "summary": "In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site\nand detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to\nbe inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and\nproperties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in\nmaterial handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow\nand expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological\nproperties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for\nthe development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - \"DIPPeR\". In\nthis paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a\nrobust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based\nnavigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first\nprocesses point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting\nthe cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D\ncone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D\ndomain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.\nWe then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while\nsuppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for\ndown-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable\nautonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection\nparameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity\nand hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This\nallows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal\npoint.

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This\napproach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex\nconstraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to\nconstrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained\ngeneration, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve\nsignificant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target\ndistributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show\nhow our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,\nusing queries to a hard-label black-box classifier.

To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,\nSymbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a\nneuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable\nmulti-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic\nplanner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic\nsubgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer\n(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot\nmanipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,\nand generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.\nWe evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\nexplore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSGDT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6027\u548c\u5bf9MDP\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DTs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "SGDT\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08GCDT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "SGDT\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eDT\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SGDT\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models.

Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts.

In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks.

In this paper, we generalize the\nstandard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of\ntwo parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three\nexisting SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be\nunified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further\npropose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into\ndesigning the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class\ninformation of the inputs.

The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,\nDictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -\nto simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from\nnormal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region\nfeatures from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature\ncannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination\nRegularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features\nharder to retrieve from the dictionary.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning.

In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,\nenabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed\nnoises, have recently attracted significant attention\n\\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.\nHowever, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few\nexceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) \\citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed\nbandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the\nloss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework\nto the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed\nlinear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the\nbest-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose\na general data-dependent learning rate, termed \\textit{heavy-tailed noise aware\nstability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW\nregret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions\nare satisfied.

However,\ncurrent methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target\ntext or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics\ninto a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering\nfine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its\nbackground. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the\nQ-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,\nwithout LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and\ntransferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query\nAlignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more\ncontrolled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both\nstandard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual\nquestion-answering tasks in black-box environment.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process.

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights\ninto SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our\nfinding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate\nperturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep\nevaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse\n(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are\ninefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can\nbe pre-calculated and reused.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization.

We\nintroduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept\nRepresentations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide\nmodels toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly\nimproves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective\neven in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy\nbinary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic\nspurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared\nto baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc\nconcept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic\nstrategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept\nsupervision.

They typically rely on\npre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics\nintegration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes\nor unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts\na 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,\nenabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We\nfirst establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction\nand probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically\nplausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics\nprediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nits simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the\ncomplex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the\ntraining, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,\nannotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates\nhigh-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute.

However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs\nstruggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when\ntrained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based\nchemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by\nconstruction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to\nensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations.

Project page: https://linjohnss.github.io/longsplat/", "summary": "LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from\ncasually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown\ncamera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose\ndrift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To\naddress these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian\nSplatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that\nconcurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and\nensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging\nlearned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that\nconverts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose\naccuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches.
