As\nUAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven\nby advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,\nefficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced\nRapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:\nTarget Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance\nexploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal\ndetours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path\nsmoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized\nbuildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant\nColony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\\% success rate with\nan average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and\nsmoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\\deg}). Despite improvements,\nlimitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and\npotential local optima due to goal biasing.

Our experiments\nexplore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering\nalgorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques\n(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and\nProjection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,\nGraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior\nperformance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage\npoints and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular\nbaseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction\nmethods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical\nrole of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This\nhighlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally\ntransforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8f8d\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9aGNN\u914d\u7f6e\uff08GraphSAGE\u7ed3\u5408PCA-KMeans\u56fe\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5b66\u751f\u53ef\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3002GNN\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u4f7f\u7528K-Means\u3001HDBSCAN\u7b49\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cPCA\u3001UMAP\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83GNN\uff08GCN\u3001GraphSAGE\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff08RF\u3001XGBoost\u3001TabNet\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "GraphSAGE\u7ed3\u5408PCA-KMeans\u56fe\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u7ea67%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fd12%\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6GNN\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "GNN\u5728\u8f8d\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding.

With the recent advances in\nvision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP\nmodel can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues\nfound in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages\nCLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on\na hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection\nsymmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel\nprompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which\naggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate\nthe semantic cues for symmetry detection.

Recent large language model\n(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on\none-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic\nadaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the\nprocesses of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)\nfor dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)\na mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks\nspecified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an\nonline subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and\nexplainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an\noptimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via\nsearch-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop\nverification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both\nsubtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected\nonline.

This limitation contrasts with the\nhuman brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided\nby processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of\nlearned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a\nsleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs.

Then we employ the Decoupled\nDistribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket\nbetween teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the\nstudent to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.\nExtensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate\nthat the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRILL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRILL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DRILL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DRILL\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving\nprimarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support\nmulti-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and\nsemantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous\ndriving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different\nmodalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not\nleverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this\nproblem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video\ngeneration approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified\ndiffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and\nmodal-specific components.

However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position).

While traditional anomaly detection methods\nprimarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at\nhome at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in\ncollective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home\nalone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.\nUnlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling\nspatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Automated\ntechnology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and\nenhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly\nspecialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers\nto buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to\ndevelop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform\nmultiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry\nexperts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these\ncollaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to\nensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand\nwhat the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a\nsafety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.\nFor safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors\nnearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human\ncomes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an\ninstrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact\nbetween objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce\na method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an\nLED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we\ndesign a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the\nhuman to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure\nsafe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's\nactions which we validate through a user study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8089\u7c7b\u52a0\u5de5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8089\u7c7b\u52a0\u5de5\u884c\u4e1a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u90e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u5229\u7528LED\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u754c\u9762\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5de5\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8089\u7c7b\u52a0\u5de5\u884c\u4e1a\u3002"}}

Existing approaches for this task rely\nsolely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the\nintrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and\nreduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose\nHRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose\nestimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud\nrepresentations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples\nobject pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately\nencoded and leveraged throughout the network.

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency.

With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at\nscale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans\ndevelop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how\nintelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,\nVirtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator\nthat supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A\nlarge-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast\noutdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with\nrich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The\nCommunity Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate\nin solving complex open-world tasks.

Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter\narray (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\\'e patterns that severely\ndegrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\\'eing models have\nbeen proposed to remove such moir\\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer\nfrom several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a\nframe, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)\nchannel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across\nframes. We address these issues with the Moir\\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive\nTransformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled\nMoir\\'e Adaptive Demoir\\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\\'eing\n(STAD). DMAD separates moir\\'e and content via a Moir\\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)\nand a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\\'e-adaptive features\nusing a Moir\\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD\nintroduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture\nlarge-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel\ndependence in RAW frames.

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness.

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data.

However, their\ntheoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains\nunderexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence.

By\nconditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),\nHistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial\nsemantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of\npatches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time\nconsistently improving MIL model performance.

However, most\ndecision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system\nmodel that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In\nthis paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for\nincident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:\nMisspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture\nabout the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,\nwhich facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds.

Path attribution methods such as Integrated\nGradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant\nfeatures (\"missingness\"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are\noften semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where\nmissingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have\nbeen explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically\nselect baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of\nmissingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline\nselection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the\nlimitations of conventional baselines.

Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer\nperceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes\ninherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel\narchitecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev\npolynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature\nrepresentation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of\nChebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more\nefficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on\nthe CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a\ncomparable number of parameters.

LLM inference is an online and multi-task\nservice process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM\nprocesses input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,\nit is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power\nconsumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown.

Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene\noptimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of\nconsistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent\nedits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing\npretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive\nresearch in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing\ndataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this\ndataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent\nedited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel\ncomponents: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven\nedits that remain coherent across all viewpoints.

While IIA violations have been\ndetected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has\nreceived scant attention.

We propose two statistical methods to test for\nIIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the\nframework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our\nmain technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its\nmere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to\nelicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the\nsame item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both\ndatasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.\nFurther, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity.

For this purpose, a comprehensive\ndataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related\nfeatures, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent\nSurveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then\napplied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by\nimportance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,\nwere then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the\nextraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification\naccuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for\noperational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the\narrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in\ndirectional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO\nperformance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway\nfor operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to\nenable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying\noperational conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cSHAP\u5206\u6790\u7684FEXAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08CDO\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CDO\u5177\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u822a\u7a7a\u9886\u57df\u6240\u9700\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ADS-B\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e861094\u6b21\u822a\u73ed\u768429\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cSHAP\u5206\u6790\u5206\u7c7bCDO\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0b\u964d\u901f\u7387\u3001\u4e0b\u964d\u6bb5\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u822a\u5411\u53d8\u5316\u4e3aCDO\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "FEXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u822a\u7a7a\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically.

They inject conditioning signals at the start\nof the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch\nwhenever the constraint changes.

Our approach builds upon a\npre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure\nControl Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two\ndistinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM\nto inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively\nanchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further\nintroducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated\nmolecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and\nadaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement\nin molecular generation for drug discovery applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCMCM-DLM\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SMILES\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff08SCM\uff09\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff08PCM\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eCMCM-DLM\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "CMCM-DLM\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While such scaling has been well studied for\nlanguage modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in\nthis regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,\nvalue-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute\nallocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed\ncompute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes\nto maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we\ncall TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for\nsmall models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use\nof large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this\nphenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize\ncompute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for\ncompute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning\nbut adapted to TD learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\uff08UTD\uff09\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0TD\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548cUTD\u6bd4\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f74\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0TD\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u52a0\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3Q\u51fd\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u65e0\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
