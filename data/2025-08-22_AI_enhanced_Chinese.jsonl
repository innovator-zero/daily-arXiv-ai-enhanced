Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control.

Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or\nmulti-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated\nby the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the\ncategory level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and\n9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional\ndata? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based\nframework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of\n2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose\nhead, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian\nmatching cost.

In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model.

To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching\nframework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly\nincorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a\nrobust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the\ntrajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017\ndemonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ntext-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified\nflow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion.

This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling\nsubstantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex\ninstructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches.

Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh\nsurface.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost.

Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the\ncombination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness\nto the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that\nis comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u91cf\u548cNGN\u6b65\u957f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08NGN-M\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6b65\u957f\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6b65\u957f\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8c03\u53c2\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNGN-M\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u91cf\u548cNGN\u6b65\u957f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u653e\u5bbd\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u63d2\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u6709\u754c\u68af\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\u3002", "result": "NGN-M\u8fbe\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6536\u655b\u7387O(1/\u221aK)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "NGN-M\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u548cNGN\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\nhave been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations\ninto sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs\npromote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their\nbase models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained\nconcept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures\nhow distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,\ngreater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often\nimpairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression.

This allows redundant lane\npredictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many\nassignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with\nindependent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.\nExtensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology\nreasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic\ntopology performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RATopo\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u9053\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5206\u914d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4ea4\u6362Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenLane-V2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRATopo\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u9053-\u8f66\u9053\u548c\u8f66\u9053-\u4ea4\u901a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RATopo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Basketball,\nin particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,\nas ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with\nfrequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.\n  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first\nmultimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds\nwith synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball\nenvironment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves\nimproved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR\ndataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully\nsynchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We\nrecorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball\nplayers, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for\neach player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that\nleverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method\nconsists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal\ntracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult\nwith conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking\nperformance even under occlusion conditions.

SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic\nunsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external\nclassifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content\ntracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful\nknowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without\ndegrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible\nforgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for\nharmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,\nLLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM\nsubstantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high\ngeneral-purpose performance.

To interpret\nexisting VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool\nand design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and\nLanguage-to-Video Knockout.

Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting\nindicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,\nforming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,\nwhile higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,\ncertain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question\nanswering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute\nminimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling\nrelies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame\nself-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational\ncost.

By\nconcentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune\nreduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased\ncomputational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across\ndiverse data characteristics and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioTune\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "BioTune\u5229\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cBioTune\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982AutoRGN\u548cLoRA\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "BioTune\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7126\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian\nSplatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static\ncomponents within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook\nbackground optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on\nfitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit\nlimited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric\nrepresentation.

The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the\ninformation of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the\ndetection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do\nnot consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global\ntemporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant\ncomputation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a\nBidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small\ntarget Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy\nsimultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.\nSpecifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design\na Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal\ndependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the\nbidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head\nfor detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the\ntraditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)\nloss.

Despite\nnotable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.\nFirst, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which\nlimits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit\nmodeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial\nfor producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it\nremains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at\ntest time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and\nbackPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method.

Five key\noperational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,\npressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,\ncombining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the\n95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of\ndocumented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using\ndomain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating\nranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to\ndistinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.\nResults showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy\nacross all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging\nfaults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual\nanalyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated\nthat the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities.

In contrast, LoD3 models address this\nlimitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and\nunderpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual\nmodeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,\nCM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models\nleveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.\nUnlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs\nwith synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map\nGenerator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured\nmodels can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase\nsegmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in\nsegmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with\nuncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research\ncontributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving\nthe way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling.

Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging\nfrom 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently\nupscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),\nimage-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,\nintegrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance\nmodality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data\nquality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually\nannotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the\nhighest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and\ninference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos.

Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a\nnovel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as\ninput, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.\nNotably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;\n(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and\nglobal scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature\nextraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of\n3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;\n(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input\nscenarios.

However, their global denoising process\ninherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading\nto unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing\ninstructions.
