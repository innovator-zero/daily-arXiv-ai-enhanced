Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control.

To\naddress this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative\nrefinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as\na mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a\nmulti-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply\nreversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a\ndiffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network\nintegrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction\n(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core\nobject regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this\nprinciple to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;\nand a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a\nfinal refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion\nmodel that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,\nharnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration\nwithout the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique\nsynergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for\nthe diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward\nambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that\nremain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a\nbroader bi-level optimization framework."}

In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the\nCRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into\ntransferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability\nvia multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level\ntransfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and\nStandalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully\ndeployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of\nbillions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters\nwith billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand\nfeatures.

To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching\nframework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly\nincorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a\nrobust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the\ntrajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017\ndemonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ntext-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified\nflow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our\nperturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success\nrate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger\nmanipulation."}

Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine\nreferences or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality\nscores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking\nloss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across\ndistortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces\nconsistency between feature distances and perceptual differences.

Project Page:\n  https://eyeline-labs.github.io/CineScale/, Code Repo:\n  https://github.com/Eyeline-Labs/CineScale", "summary": "Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically\ntrained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and\nconstrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have\nexplored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential\nhigher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these\nmethods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive\npatterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency\ninformation when the model generates visual content exceeding its training\nresolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the\naccumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference\nparadigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various\nissues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we\npropose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods\nthat are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens\nthe scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop\nstate-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of\nhigher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.\nRemarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,\nand achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Each stage of the network\nintegrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction\n(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core\nobject regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this\nprinciple to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;\nand a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a\nfinal refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion\nmodel that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,\nharnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration\nwithout the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique\nsynergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for\nthe diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward\nambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that\nremain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a\nbroader bi-level optimization framework."}

However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation\nprocess, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,\nsuch as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of\nnon-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.\nHowever, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion\nprocess can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian\nprocesses. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce\nskipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate\ndenoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the\ntraditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,\nwe demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the\nsame training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that\naccelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an\nintrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an\nenhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique\nwith DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,\nincluding the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our\nmethod achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling\nsteps."}

Despite\nnotable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.\nFirst, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which\nlimits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit\nmodeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial\nfor producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it\nremains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at\ntest time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and\nbackPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian\nprobabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using\ngradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables\nclosed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we\nintroduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical\nknowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full\naccess to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.\nExtensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts\nwith superior scalability and robustness."}

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our\nperturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success\nrate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger\nmanipulation."}
