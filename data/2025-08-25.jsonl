However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model\nsizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and\nenergy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the\nhighest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the\ncorresponding codes publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner."}

Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a\nhierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,\nand interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional\nparameter efficiency.

We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency.

To this end, we propose\nUnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation\nand reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a\npre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D\nframe, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model\nusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise\nepistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field.

In\nparticular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic\nProgramming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency\nfunctions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific\nphase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic\nfeatures of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this\nissue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the\nphase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This\nis represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the\nurgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve\nthe symmetric phase urgency function.

To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method\nfor classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently\nwith Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear\nclassifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.\nFurthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was\nproposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features\nachieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower\ncomputational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance\nof the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values\nof 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The\nfindings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor\nimagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and\nclassification of MI-EEG."}

Benchmarked on the public Drive\\&Act\ndataset, \\textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\\%$ over\nstrong probing baselines and $+8.0\\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any\nparameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary\nactivities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\\%$ under the trained view and\n$+1.36\\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence\nthat adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like\n\\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,\nespecially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the\nimportance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to\nbuild robust driver monitoring systems.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated.

Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile\nsensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking\nand reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for\nin-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present\nGelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to\nestimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high\nfidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses\ntactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop\nclosure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal\ndrift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture\nobjects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local\ncontact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it\nwill serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving\ninteraction with objects in hand.

For example,\nthey appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,\nand the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour\ndata, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated\noutputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally\nequivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered\nsequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is\ntherefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under\ncyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning\nfrom contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance\nthrough complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and\ncharacterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling\nlayers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape\nclassification, reconstruction, and contour regression."}

However, the high computational cost of\ndiffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and\ncomplex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time\ndeployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration\nmethod that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.\nUnlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step\nsimilarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach\noriginates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically\nanalyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache\nreuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more\neffective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion\ntrajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the\nsampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the\ncorresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling\ndirection.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the\nsampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a\npromising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based\ngenerative models."}
