### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 训练一个基于自然语言描述的3D手部动作生成模型，利用大规模手语视频数据集和伪标注数据，通过扩散模型HandMDM实现跨领域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是生成符合自然语言描述的3D手部动作，填补手语和非手语动作生成领域的空白。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和伪标注数据，通过LLM翻译为动作描述，训练扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 模型在未见手语类别、跨语言手语及非手语动作中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: HandMDM为手部动作生成领域提供了新工具，并公开模型和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR框架通过视频到事件的映射和LVLM推理模块，实现了长期视频中细粒度动作识别的高性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型在长期视频动作识别中的计算开销大、难以捕捉长程时间依赖和语义理解有限的问题。

Method: 提出VTEM模块将视频转换为视觉事件序列，并结合LLaVA-1.5模型进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D数据集上达到94.1%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 展示了LVLMs在视频动作理解中的潜力，通过高效的视频到语言转换和模型适配。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一种新型框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用视觉语言病理基础模型的潜力，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但由于专家资源有限（尤其是儿科肿瘤学中占70%以上），诊断面临挑战。现有方法依赖单一视觉特征，忽略了跨模态知识。

Method: PathPT通过将WSI级监督转化为细粒度瓦片级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力，保留对癌变区域的定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集和3个常见癌症数据集上，PathPT在亚型分类和癌变区域定位方面表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathPT为罕见癌症的AI辅助诊断提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了亚型分类准确性。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以捕捉细粒度语义信息，限制了检测效果。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）和多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，并引入ShipSem-VL数据集。

Result: 通过三项任务评估，展示了框架在多角度提升语义感知船舶检测的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂场景中显著提升了船舶检测的语义感知能力。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动化系统，用于奶牛的无接触识别和分类，包括AutoCattloger、eidetic cow recognizer和CowFinder。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中缺乏自动化视频系统用于奶牛的无接触识别和分类。

Method: 系统由三个组件组成：AutoCattloger构建奶牛目录，eidetic cow recognizer无需深度学习识别奶牛，CowFinder在连续视频流中识别奶牛。

Result: 系统成功在未标记、未分割的视频中识别出自由行走的奶牛。

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛的无接触识别和分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用物种分布模型作为地理先验，提升视觉分类的准确性。

Method: 评估不同SINR模型配置，调整对未训练物种预测的处理方式。

Result: 揭示了影响模型作为地理先验效果的因素，与范围图准确性因素不同。

Conclusion: SINR模型可作为有效的地理先验，但需注意配置和未训练物种的处理。

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，通过自适应超像素层动态调整图像内容，克服传统ViT固定大小分块的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型依赖特定模态和网格结构假设，限制了灵活性。

Method: 采用自适应超像素层动态调整图像内容，基于Transformer的自监督学习。

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准上优于广泛使用的替代方法。

Conclusion: ASC通过动态调整图像内容的分块方式，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾小球亚型分类因形态学差异细微且视觉模式与临床术语对齐困难，传统方法效果有限，需要探索预训练模型在数据受限场景下的适应性。

Method: 提出Glo-VLMs框架，利用病理图像和临床文本提示进行联合表征学习，评估不同VLM架构和适应策略在少样本学习中的表现。

Result: 在每类仅8个样本的情况下，模型达到0.7416准确率、0.9045宏AUC和0.5277 F1分数。

Conclusion: 预训练模型即使监督极少，也能有效适应细粒度医学图像分类，为临床研究提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Conclusion: 结论是总结了当前成果，并展望了未来研究方向，重点是扩展和增强标签高效学习在实际应用中的效果。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用基于实例和全景分割的CNN方法提高海洋垃圾监测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋垃圾是全球性问题，传统CNN模型在复杂沙滩环境中表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用基于实例的分割方法和全景分割方法，仅需少量样本即可实现高精度。

Result: 模型在复杂环境下表现更鲁棒，减少了误判。

Conclusion: 提出的分割方法在海洋垃圾监测中具有高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

*Jerry Cao-Xue,Tien Comlekoglu,Keyi Xue,Guanliang Wang,Jiang Li,Gordon Laurie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据集SynFundus-1M的多标签深度学习模型，用于视网膜疾病分类，并通过多种架构和集成方法实现了高性能和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于患者隐私和高成本，临床数据稀缺，阻碍了多标签深度学习模型的发展。合成数据集SynFundus-1M为解决这一问题提供了新机会。

Method: 使用六种现代架构（如ConvNeXtV2、SwinV2等）训练模型，采用5折多标签分层交叉验证，并通过XGBoost构建元集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上表现最佳（AUC 0.9973），并在三个真实临床数据集上展示了强泛化能力（AUC 0.7972-0.9126）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅用合成数据训练的模型能有效分类多种病理并泛化到真实临床图像，为眼科AI系统开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

*Mohamed Ilyes Lakhal,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于生成多样化的手语表示，同时保持视觉质量和非手动特征（如情感）的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以在保持视觉质量的同时捕捉多样性，尤其是非手动特征（如面部表情和情感）。

Method: 使用LDM从生成的参考图像合成逼真数字化身，并提出新的手语特征聚合模块，分别建模非手动特征（如面部）和手动特征（如手部）。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上，该方法在视觉质量和感知指标上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了多样性与视觉质量的平衡，同时有效建模了非手动特征。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

Conclusion: DRespNeT数据集和模型提升了SAR团队的效率和幸存者救援效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖关键点检测技术（如SfM和手部关键点优化），难以应对多样物体几何、弱纹理和遮挡问题，限制了扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种无需关键点检测的方法，结合多视角重建管道，无需预扫描物体模板或相机内参。

Result: 在SHOWMe基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并在HO3D数据集上展示了泛化能力。

Conclusion: HOSt3R方法在无需关键点检测和模板的情况下，实现了鲁棒且泛化的手-物体3D重建。

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [17] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过结合离散小波变换和多层CNN特征，改进了PaDiM方法，提升了工业图像异常检测和定位的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降维可能丢失结构化信息，WE-PaDiM旨在通过小波变换提供更有效的特征选择。

Method: WE-PaDiM对多层CNN特征图应用2D离散小波变换，选择特定频率子带并拼接，再使用PaDiM的高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，WE-PaDiM实现了99.32%的Image-AUC和92.10%的Pixel-AUC，表现优异。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为工业检测提供了一种高效且可解释的替代方案，优于随机特征选择。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ERA的新型知识蒸馏方法，通过分解残差知识逐步逼近教师模型，显著提升了学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师模型与学生模型之间学习能力差距导致的知识传递不足问题。

Method: 使用多分支残差网络（MBRNet）分解残差知识，并引入教师权重集成（TWI）策略减少能力差距。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务中AP提升1.40。

Conclusion: ERA方法通过逐步逼近和权重集成，有效提升了知识蒸馏的效果，并在多个视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM)，通过稀疏3D卷积增强点云数据的体素级表示和扩散，显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和SSM的模型因输入输出维度严格一致而限制了空间扩散能力，影响了检测精度。

Method: VDM结合稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，输出特征图降采样至原始分辨率的1/4。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，VDM显著提升了检测精度，如Waymo上达到74.7 mAPH (L2)。

Conclusion: VDM是一种通用性强的方法，可无缝集成到主流检测模型中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有病理基础模型因数据集和训练策略不同导致性能不一致和泛化性有限，ELF旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ELF集成五种先进病理基础模型，利用53,699张全切片图像进行训练，通过集成学习捕获互补信息。

Conclusion: ELF展示了集成学习在病理基础模型中的强大潜力，为AI辅助精准肿瘤学提供了可扩展和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces

is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local

capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Conclusion: DAFR2通过统计和表示层面的特征对齐，实现了跨域的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RAGSR通过细粒度区域描述和注意力机制，有效克服了传统超分辨率技术的局限性，提升了多物体场景下的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Result: 在Pascal-5i和COCO-20i上分别提升13.2%和9.7%，参数仅为现有模型的1/24。

Conclusion: TLG首次在弱监督下超越全监督模型，展示了异构网络设计的有效性。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised

Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割（UVOS）在初始分割和时间一致性方面存在挑战，FTIO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FTIO包含两个关键组件：改进对象选择的组合准则和三阶段方法纠正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验表明FTIO在多对象UVOS中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FTIO通过提取频繁出现的显著对象和整合缺失对象掩码区域，有效提升了UVOS的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频令牌表示，导致内存和计算开销大，且现有令牌缩减方法存在信息损失。

Method: 采用两阶段视频令牌剪枝：第一阶段基于注意力信号选择高信息量令牌，第二阶段均匀剪枝冗余令牌。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为T-Mask的新方法，通过时间令牌掩码提升驾驶员监控中的跨视角识别能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员监控中相机视角变化是常见挑战，现有方法在未见过视角下的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用图像基础模型（DINOv2和CLIP），提出T-Mask方法，通过时间令牌掩码强调动态视频区域。

Result: T-Mask在Drive&Act数据集上跨视角准确率提升1.23%，对次要活动识别提升显著。

Conclusion: 轻量级探测方法（如T-Mask）在驾驶员监控中潜力巨大，尤其在跨视角和低数据场景。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

TL;DR: FoCa提出了一种基于ODE视角的特征缓存方法，显著提升了DiTs在高加速比下的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加。

Method: 将隐藏特征序列建模为特征-ODE，提出FoCa（Forecast-then-Calibrate）方法，通过预测和校准解决特征缓存问题。

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中，FoCa实现了5.50倍到6.45倍的加速，且质量接近无损。

Conclusion: FoCa无需额外训练即可显著提升DiTs的推理速度，同时保持高质量生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的加速方法，通过利用去噪过程中的全局冗余性，优化扩散模型的采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer的高计算成本限制了实时部署，需要一种高效的加速方法。

Method: OmniCache从采样角度出发，系统分析采样轨迹并全局分配缓存重用，同时动态估计和过滤噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持生成质量的同时显著加速采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为扩散模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个新基准，用于评估医疗大语言模型在推理可靠性和抗误导性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准常将模型的漏洞简化为单一准确度分数，无法全面评估医疗LLMs的推理可靠性和抗误导性。

Method: 设计了包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，覆盖六种专业和三种任务类型，每个问题配以七种误导性提示和无提示基线。

Result: 评估了七种LLMs，结果显示安全性和性能之间存在权衡，开源模型QwQ-32B表现最佳（43.81 Degrees）。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees为暴露医疗LLMs的推理漏洞和指导更安全的模型开发提供了针对性基准。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高质量图像修改能力可能被恶意利用，现有方法依赖图像级不一致性，无法有效解决文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，针对提示嵌入中的共享令牌注入对抗噪声，干扰采样过程。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种高效且鲁棒的图像保护方法，防止未经授权的修改。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态创意写作中文本与图像语义不一致的问题，并降低训练成本。

Method: 采用T2I模块、模态语义对齐门控（msaGate）和跨模态注意力融合，结合mscDPO优化创意。

Result: FlexMUSE在ArtMUSE数据集上表现出色，实现了语义一致性和创意性。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE为多模态创意写作提供了经济高效的解决方案，并提升了模态间的协调性。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Motivation: MLLMs在GUI元素坐标生成中因语义空白和训练数据不足而表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 采用IoU-based坐标采样增强训练数据，并通过IAML范式微调MLLMs以减少暴露偏差。

Result: 实验表明IAML训练范式优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效提升了MLLMs在GUI坐标生成中的精确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior

Motivation: 现有方法未考虑花样滑冰评分标准，且未分离TES和PCS的特征评估，同时难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系。

Method: 采用双流网络，分别基于视觉特征评估TES和基于视听特征评估PCS，引入多级融合机制和Mamba金字塔处理多尺度动作元素。

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到最先进性能，有效解决了长视频处理和动作元素评估的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离特征流和多级融合机制，显著提升了TES和PCS的预测准确性，适用于花样滑冰的长视频评估。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

Motivation: 多模态学习中单模态噪声影响融合效果，且现有方法可能忽略单模态的判别性信息。

Method: 使用跨模态关系图重构单模态特征，结合分层交互注意力（HIMA）聚焦单模态关键信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证了框架对多任务的有效性。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT能有效理解多模态内容并提升多任务性能。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

### [46] [Exploiting Information Redundancy in Attention Maps for Extreme Quantization of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16311)
*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息冗余的注意力图压缩方法（EAM），通过量化低熵注意力图以减少计算和内存需求，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHSA的计算复杂性和高内存需求限制了其在边缘设备上的部署，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 利用香农熵量化注意力头的信息量，冻结低熵注意力图的权重并量化其值以减少冗余计算。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上验证，EAM在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时保持或提高准确性，并在更高稀疏度下表现竞争力。

Conclusion: EAM通过压缩低熵注意力图，有效减少了计算和内存需求，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Motivation: 现代视觉编码器缺乏生物视觉的效率，任务驱动的动态计算更符合实际需求。

Method: 提出任务驱动的动态计算复杂度方法，并以图像分类为例进行概念验证。

Result: 初步实验表明该方法可行且有前景。

Conclusion: 任务驱动的动态视觉编码器是未来发展方向，初步成果验证了其潜力。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

TL;DR: RTW的功能可解释为一种自注意力机制，类似于Transformer中的核心机制，但RTW在全局输入序列上操作，性能优于Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示RTW与自注意力机制的相似性，并比较两者在运动识别中的表现。

Method: 将RTW的贡献权重解释为自注意力权重，分析两者的相似性和差异。

Result: RTW与自注意力权重高度相关（平均0.80），且在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW作为一种全局自注意力机制，在运动识别中优于局部自注意力的Transformer。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

TL;DR: GMBINet是一种轻量级框架，通过GMBI模块增强多尺度特征提取和交互，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现实时表面缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在钢铁制造行业中因高计算复杂度和慢推理速度而受限，无法在资源受限的工业环境中部署。

Method: 提出GMBI模块，采用分组策略进行多尺度特征提取，并结合BPFI和EWMS操作增强跨尺度交互。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现高精度和实时速度（GPU 1048 FPS，CPU 16.53 FPS），仅需0.19 M参数。

Conclusion: GMBINet在表面缺陷检测和分类任务中表现出色，具有广泛工业应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有多传感器融合方法在恶劣天气（如浓雾、雪、污垢）下表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于注意力的深度混合方案，结合RGB、LiDAR、NIR和雷达数据，并在BEV平面上进行特征融合，使用Transformer解码器加权模态。

Result: 在长距离和浓雾场景下，对易受伤害行人的检测平均精度提升了17.2 AP。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在恶劣天气条件下的传感器融合可靠性，填补了理想条件与现实边缘案例之间的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: HAMSt3R是一种扩展自MASt3R的方法，用于从稀疏、未校准的多视角图像中联合重建人类和场景的3D几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R在静态户外场景表现良好，但在人类中心场景中表现不佳。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器，结合多任务网络头（分割、DensePose、深度预测）实现联合重建。

Result: 在EgoHumans和EgoExo4D等基准测试中表现优异，同时支持传统多视角任务。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人类与场景3D理解的鸿沟，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯超分辨率方法通常仅支持固定尺度因子，无法适应资源受限场景，且直接渲染任意尺度会导致锯齿伪影。

Method: 构建了一个集成框架，结合尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数尺度渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单模型下能高质量渲染任意尺度高分辨率视图（PSNR提升6.59 dB），保持结构一致性，并维持实时渲染速度（85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高效、灵活的任意尺度3D高斯超分辨率渲染。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Result: 微调可能导致动态准确性下降，但持续学习策略能平衡视觉质量和空间准确性。

Conclusion: 在驾驶场景中，持续学习策略是平衡视觉质量和动态准确性的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the

increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Result: 实验表明，MV-RAG在OOD/稀有概念上显著优于现有方法，同时保持标准基准的竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索和混合训练策略，有效解决了OOD/稀有概念的3D生成问题。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的规模增长带来了部署、扩展和能源效率的挑战，现有剪枝方法常导致性能下降或需要昂贵微调。

Method: Z-Pruner结合权重更新幅度和激活模式，高效识别并剪枝冗余参数，无需重新训练，适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: Z-Pruner为LLM提供了一种高效、通用的剪枝方案，显著降低模型复杂度且保持性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 简化模型在保持高精度的同时提高了计算效率，是ECG监测的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a

*Xiaojuan Tang,Fanxu Meng,Pingzhi Tang,Yuxuan Wang,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPLA是一种在张量并行环境中优化多头潜在注意力（MLA）的方法，通过分区和全归约操作减少KV缓存，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在张量并行（TP）中，MLA的KV缓存优势被削弱，因为每个设备需加载完整缓存。TPLA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TPLA将潜在表示和输入维度分区，独立计算注意力后通过全归约合并结果，支持正交变换以减少干扰。

Result: TPLA在DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2上分别实现1.79x和1.93x加速，且性能未下降。

Conclusion: TPLA在保持MLA优势的同时提升了TP效率，适用于预训练模型且无需重新训练。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的时间序列因果发现框架，解决了非线性依赖和伪相关问题，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列因果发现中的非线性依赖和伪相关挑战。

Method: 使用多层Transformer模型捕捉长期非线性关系，并通过梯度分析提取因果结构和时间滞后。

Result: F1-score提升12.8%，因果滞后估计准确率达98.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在因果发现和滞后估计上表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

Motivation: 现有方法中，监督学习和强化学习与启发式结合时耗时且效果不佳，因此探索了更高效的图表示学习技术。

Method: 将GRL融入GRASP的构建阶段，形成GL-GRASP方法，并测试了不同节点嵌入技术。

Result: GL-GRASP在原始积分指标上优于现有GRASP方法，且在更密集的实例中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GL-GRASP是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于C-IGDP问题。

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Conclusion: 该系统通过集成机器学习与IIR滤波器，为铁路系统提供了高效、实时的安全监测解决方案。

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Motivation: 研究在分布偏移下，如何通过自适应策略优化学习性能，并扩展现有无偏移情况的结果。

Method: 采用自适应离散化和乐观消除策略，自调整以适应分布偏移，引入偏好后悔作为性能指标。

Result: 在不同分布偏移假设下，建立了后悔上界，结果在问题参数下表现良好。

Conclusion: 策略在分布偏移下表现优越，扩展了现有无偏移情况的结果，且参数适应性良好。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 显著提升了EP的可扩展性，为其在现实系统中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Conclusion: 论文为Cartan神经网络提供了数学基础，并提出了多个新数学结果和猜想。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Conclusion: PAC-MCoFL在多SP联邦学习环境中实现了高效且平衡的资源分配和性能优化。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 为时间分布漂移下的判别分析提供了统一且数据高效的基础。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Conclusion: 对称相位紧迫性函数是一种有效且可解释的交通信号控制策略改进方法。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存随序列长度增加导致的内存挑战，避免现有方法需修改架构或性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用SVD实现相邻参数共享，并通过自适应预算分配动态调整压缩预算。

Result: 在多种模型和基准测试中表现优异，最高可实现98%压缩率且性能损失小。

Conclusion: CommonKV方法高效且与其他压缩技术正交，为LLMs内存优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

Result: 在GAIA验证集和DeepResearcher数据集上表现优异，优于现有基于训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发无需梯度更新的通用LLM代理提供了可扩展且高效的途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Result: 实证表明崩溃误差普遍存在，且与高分噪声区的学习问题及确定性采样器动态相关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了分数学习与确定性采样交互的重要性，呼吁进一步研究以优化扩散模型。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Result: SPL-LNS在不同规模的ILP问题上显著优于现有神经LNS求解器。

Conclusion: SPL-LNS通过改进提案和训练方法，有效提升了LNS求解器的性能。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Method: 使用MiniRocket高效提取特征，并结合线性分类器；同时提出CNN-LSTM深度学习模型作为基线。

Result: 在PhysioNet数据集上，MiniRocket和CNN-LSTM分别达到98.63%和98.06%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MI-EEG分类性能，为特征提取和分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

TL;DR: GEM是一种参数高效微调方法，通过梯度与权重比和熵引导掩码，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PEFT方法仅更新少量参数且不考虑参数原始尺度，导致模型行为变化有限。

Method: 提出GEM框架，基于梯度与权重比和熵引导掩码，选择性地更新参数并自适应确定每层更新数量。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、GSM8k和MBPP任务上，GEM仅更新0.1%参数即可超越全微调1.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: GEM通过参数尺度感知和分布敏感稀疏微调，显著提升了PEFT的效率和效果。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

TL;DR: UMATO是一种新的降维技术，通过两阶段优化同时捕捉局部和全局结构，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据降维技术通常只能保留局部或全局结构之一，可能导致误导性结论。UMATO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: UMATO将UMAP的优化过程分为两阶段：首先生成骨架布局，然后投影剩余点以保留区域特征。

Result: UMATO在全局结构保留上优于UMAP等现有技术，同时保持局部结构，且具有更好的可扩展性和稳定性。

Conclusion: UMATO通过两阶段优化有效平衡局部和全局结构，提升了高维数据可视化的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

Result: PIANO在时间依赖PDE和天气预报中表现优于现有方法，提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: PIANO通过自回归建模解决了PINNs的稳定性问题，成为时间依赖PDE的先进解决方案。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: 该方法为咳嗽声的病理生理特征提供了新见解，展示了XAI在生物医学信号分析和呼吸系统疾病诊断中的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Result: Prophet在季节性和长期趋势数据中表现与LSTM相当或更好，而LSTM在结构突变数据中更优。

Conclusion: 在资源受限地区，应选择与数据特性匹配的高效预测方法，而非盲目追求模型复杂度。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

Conclusion: C-DaSh方法为大规模表格数据集的质量评估提供了实用解决方案，适用于分类和回归任务。

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将可靠性和安全性分开分析可能导致过拟合，需要更全面的威胁评估框架。

Method: 1. 提取信号特征；2. 多任务学习架构评估能力和意图；3. 自适应威胁评估。

Result: 框架优于传统方法，能有效应对复杂威胁场景。

Conclusion: 该框架为空间网络提供了更鲁棒的威胁评估解决方案。

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

TL;DR: OwkinZero模型通过强化学习在生物医学任务上超越大型商业LLMs，展示了泛化能力。


<details>

Result: OwkinZero模型在生物医学任务上表现优于商业LLMs，并展示了跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 针对性的强化学习可以提升LLMs在生物医学领域的性能，推动AI驱动的生物发现。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Motivation: 水管网络对公共福祉和经济稳定至关重要，但面临管道堵塞和背景泄漏等问题，且受限于数据非平稳性和标记数据不足。

Result: 在两个实际水管网络上的实验表明，该方法在检测异常和适应漂移方面优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态水管网络环境中表现出色，适用于无监督事件检测。

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RotaTouille是一个深度学习框架，用于处理轮廓数据，通过复数圆卷积实现旋转和循环位移的等变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓数据在许多领域中常见，且输入旋转会导致输出相应旋转，因此需要模型具有旋转等变性。此外，轮廓通常表示为有序点序列，起始点选择是任意的，因此也需要循环位移等变性。

Method: 使用复数圆卷积实现旋转和循环位移等变性，并引入等变非线性层、粗化层和全局池化层以获得不变表示。

Result: 在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归任务中验证了RotaTouille的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille通过复数圆卷积和等变层设计，成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环位移等变性，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Conclusion: 研究结果可为未来偏见相关软件工程研究和教育提供指导。

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决大学录取中的公平性问题，尤其是在未知申请人群体的背景下，确保录取政策的透明性和公平性。

Method: 方法包括一次性设置（固定录取政策）和顺序设置（动态更新政策），利用历史数据训练群体模型优化录取政策。

Result: 研究结果分析了两种设置下的公平性，包括精英主义和群体平等。

Conclusion: 结论表明顺序设置能更好地适应动态申请人群，但一次性设置在透明性方面更具优势。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统射频电路性能预测工具计算成本高，现有机器学习方法需要大量数据，难以泛化到不同拓扑或复杂性能指标。

Method: 采用设备终端级建模的GNN，结合掩码自回归流（MAF）输出头，以捕捉对称性和细粒度连接细节。

Result: 实验显示预测误差（sMAPE和MRE）平均为2.40%和2.91%，数据需求减少2.24倍，误差降低3.14倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在射频电路设计自动化中实现了快速且准确的性能预测。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

Motivation: 现有RvS方法（如DT）在目标回报对齐上表现不佳，尤其在数据不足或超出数据集时。

Method: 提出Doctor方法，通过双重检查Transformer确保目标回报对齐，支持精确策略控制。

Result: 在EpiCare基准测试中，Doctor能有效平衡治疗回报与副作用风险。

Conclusion: Doctor在离线强化学习中实现了更优的目标对齐和策略性能控制。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Motivation: 探索LLM在快速生成棋盘游戏代码方面的潜力，以简化游戏开发流程。

Method: 使用三种先进的LLM（Claude、DeepSeek和ChatGPT）为12款游戏生成代码，并在自定义API（Boardwalk）中测试其可玩性和规则合规性。

Result: 最佳模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet实现了55.6%的无错误游戏生成，API使用增加了错误频率，但错误严重性主要取决于LLM。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM在棋盘游戏代码生成中的可行性，并提出了未来框架开发的步骤。

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Result: NOSTRA在噪声和稀疏数据场景下优于现有方法，加速收敛到Pareto前沿，提高数据效率和解决方案质量。

Conclusion: NOSTRA为实验预算有限的场景提供了一种资源高效且性能优越的优化算法。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Result: FraPPE在合成和真实数据集上均表现出最低的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: FraPPE算法在计算效率和样本复杂度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and

Conclusion: 研究表明，将物理反馈引入生成模型能有效提升分子结构的物理合理性。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

Conclusion: 该方法使模型的预测更可靠和可解释，有助于理解太阳风暴预测的机制。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-FT能部分恢复SFT导致的OOD性能损失，但无法完全修复严重过拟合和分布偏移。奇异向量方向变化比奇异值大小更重要，且集中在极值方向。低秩和浅层恢复有效，强SFT检查点更易被RL修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SFT和RL-FT如何影响模型表示和OOD性能，探索恢复性能的有效方法。

Method: 使用24点卡牌游戏的OOD变体和基于频谱的诊断工具，分析SFT和RL-FT对模型的影响。

Result: RL-FT可部分恢复OOD性能，但严重过拟合时效果有限；低秩和浅层恢复能恢复70-80%性能。

Conclusion: RL主要抵消SFT导致的方向漂移，而非寻找新解；频谱分析为低成本恢复提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning

TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes
dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for
structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将L0视为自由参数，但未研究其对SAE学习LLM底层特征的影响。

Method: 通过实验研究L0对BatchTopK SAEs的影响，并提出确定正确L0值的方法。

Result: 发现L0设置不当会导致特征混合，正确L0值在玩具模型和LLM中均表现最佳。

Conclusion: SAE训练中必须正确设置L0参数才能学习到正确的特征。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Motivation: 由于隐私法规限制，云端基础模型无法直接访问边缘设备的私有数据，而现有联邦学习方法未充分考虑边缘设备的计算资源限制和标记数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL)设置，结合Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox)框架，通过稀疏专家混合架构和Soft-Mixture策略解决计算和分辨率不匹配问题。

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的实验表明，FedMox在PSSFL下显著提升了基础模型的适配性能，同时约束了边缘设备的内存开销。

Conclusion: FedMox为联邦场景下可扩展且隐私保护的基础模型适配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Result: SSL表征偏向成人语音，从头训练可缓解偏差；模型规模增至1B参数时性能提升，之后趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 开源数据模型对儿童语音研究更可靠，Whisper等专有模型存在局限性，公开基准为儿童语音处理提供指导。

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as

complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to

leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from

Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable

policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive

achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%

Motivation: 传统方法依赖CAD模型，获取成本高且不实用；现有方法需要额外训练或产生虚假几何。

Result: 在6D姿态估计和3D重建质量上显著优于现有方法，适用于真实机器人操作任务。

Conclusion: UnPose提供了一种高效、无需CAD模型的解决方案，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: GelSLAM扩展了触觉感知能力，为高精度操作任务提供了基础。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

Result: 在合成和真实实验中验证了方法的准确性，能够提供对象数量、面积等语义信息及形状置信度。

Conclusion: 该方法在多样结构化环境中实现了高效、语义丰富的定位与建图，适用于安全导航等下游任务。

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

Conclusion: SWA方法提高了多无人机系统的可靠性和弹性，适用于定位不可靠或失效的挑战性环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using
tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV
systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior
in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于四足机器人Spot的地形分类器，通过降维和分类技术识别地形类型，准确率达97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在复杂地形中易出现下沉和打滑等问题，需要地形分类器来规划更安全的路径。

Method: 利用Spot提供的100多个本体感受信号，结合降维和分类技术开发地形分类器。

Result: 在实地测试中，分类器能准确识别三种地形类型，准确率约97%。

Conclusion: 该地形分类器有效提升了四足机器人在复杂地形中的导航安全性。

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

Motivation: 解决类似车辆在复杂3D地形中的动力学规划问题，确保从初始状态到目标状态的连续运动。

Method: 将问题建模为混合整数分数规划，通过变量变换和McCormick包络松弛为混合整数线性规划。

Result: 比MPPI和log-MPPI快104倍，严格满足约束条件。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂环境中高效且可靠。

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.
