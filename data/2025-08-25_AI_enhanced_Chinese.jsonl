However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model\nsizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and\nenergy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates.

In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA).

Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback\npolicy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive\nexperiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%\naverage success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the\npracticality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

Recent approaches aim to\nbypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to\nreconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require\nadditional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose\nUnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation\nand reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a\npre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D\nframe, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model\nusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise\nepistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field.

Many attempts employ supervised or\nreinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.\nHowever, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not\ncompetitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization\nbetween metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the\nlatent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL).

The\nevaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of\nthe solutions according to the required time for such. According to this\nmeasure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than\nstate-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem.

When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts\nwith the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments\nin a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times\nbetter when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the\nuser was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and\ninteractive questioning.

The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various\nmathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to\nintroduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric\nspaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In\nparticular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced\nthe notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the\nbase space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the\nrepresentation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general\ntheory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations\nthat produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the\ngroup theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric\nspaces $\\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its\nnormal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the\ngenus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient\nautomorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of\nthe Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces\n$\\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in\nterms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to\nobtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza\nRiemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the\nAbel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel\nTheta function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ee7\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55Cartan\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u548cTS\u5411\u91cf\u4e1b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u79bb\u5668\u6784\u9020\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3aCartan\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cTS\u5411\u91cf\u4e1b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u548cTS\u5411\u91cf\u4e1b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u79bb\u5668\u6784\u9020\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u70ed\u6838\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5668\u6784\u9020\u3001\u65b0\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u731c\u60f3\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6784\u5efaBolza\u9ece\u66fc\u9762\u4e0a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u672c\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aCartan\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u731c\u60f3\u3002"}}

This\nis represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the\nurgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve\nthe symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the\nwell-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world\ndatasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency\nfunction representation can significantly improve the performance of the\nlearned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation\non a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method\ncan evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal\ncontrol policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f8\u4f4d\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u4f4d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f8\u4f4d\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f4d\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u8fdb\u5316\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f8\u4f4d\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate\nthat collapse errors occur across a variety of settings.

The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method.

A significant challenge is\npresented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)\ntasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and\nindividual diversity.

To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method\nfor classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently\nwith Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear\nclassifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.\nFurthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was\nproposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features\nachieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower\ncomputational cost.

Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local\nneighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as\npairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches\ncan mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of\nmanifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the\ncompactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to\nseparate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this\nresearch, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with\nTwo-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by\neffectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by\ndividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,\nit constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second\nphase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional\ncharacteristics.

Existing methods face three major challenges.\nFirstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and\nPCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation\ncriterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are\nseparated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but\nexisting methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each\naction element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and\ninefficient to handle long-range contexts.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

The self-attention is a\nmechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different\nparts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general\nextension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching\nand comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal\ncontribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to\nproduce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,\nthese contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights.

This survey charts the\nconvergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection\n(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally\napplicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of\nfoundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and\ndatasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics\nstarting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out\nof distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,\nzero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the\noverlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their\npotential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u201d\uff08OWD\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u901a\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u878d\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u56de\u987e\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ece\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u878d\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OWD\uff09\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
