A\ncomparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost\nsavings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical\nevaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact\nthat the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these\npromising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive\nframework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future\ninnovations in COP optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08QI-DRL\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u548cOrnstein-Uhlenbeck\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7eba\u7ec7\u884c\u4e1a\u5207\u5272\u8ba2\u5355\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8868\u793a\u3001LSTM\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u6349\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caOU\u566a\u58f0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e73\u6ed1\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u57281000\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u4e3a0.81\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u964d\u81f30.15\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8282\u770113%\u7684\u5e03\u6599\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728COP\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, significant challenges arise when implementing\npath velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.\nThe primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory\nplanning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves\nmaintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,\nparticularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based\nrapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above\nchallenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time\nefficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance\nframework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned\ntrajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal\nsmoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the\nproposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path\nadheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to\nmaintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility\nof the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time\nefficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other\niteration-based trajectory planning methods.

The\nheterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by\nhierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,\nmean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell\nproperties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also\ntreated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)\n4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is\nmore accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains\naccuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios.

A\npandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was\nnot prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people\nworldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the\nrespiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive\nresearch, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being\nlost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying\ngasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as\nthere was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and\nventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all.

Computer models are less\nprone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to\ngive better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a\nConvolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our\nmodel will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the\npositive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or\nunfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT\nscans in the dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80ba\u90e8CT\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u5224\u65adCOVID19\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "COVID19\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u7403\u5927\u91cf\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u8870\u7aed\u3002\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u77ed\u7f3a\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u75c5\u60c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80ba\u90e8CT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u67d3\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u68c0\u6d4b\u9633\u6027\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u75c5\u60c5\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u6076\u5316\uff08\u5982\u9700\u8981\u63d2\u7ba1\u6216\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5CNN\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aCOVID19\u75c5\u60c5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e14\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

However,\nthis challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting\nof old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a\ndecoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision\nboundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP\nbenchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN\nachieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to\nstate-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

The results\nindicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models\nyields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for\nreal-world time series applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1TSFMs\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u9886\u57df\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u88c5\u888b\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u5806\u53e0\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6b8b\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bef\u5dee\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u7535\u529b\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy.

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising\nstrategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce\nRoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables\nfine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic\nattributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first\nmodel to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,\nfacilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic\ndataset comprising over 565,000 images.

In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data\nnaively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data\nfor supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through\nextensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,\nwe demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model\nperformance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness\nacross demographic subgroups.

This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely\ndevelop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on\ncommercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are\ndesigned to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in\nsize and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some\nmetal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a\nlarge number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the\nparts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To\naddress these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that\ncan be built entirely from components available via e-commerce.

In\nthis work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive\nalter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs.

Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task.

However, most existing methods are\nobsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans\ntypically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at\nan overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a\nmulti-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we\nmodel image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five\ntechnical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of\nhuman visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is\ninitially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the\nrespective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.\nAdditionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible\ntraining of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to\nbetter align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual\ndimension weights.

However, existing CapsNet and\nvariants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich\ncomplementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional\nfeature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to\nreconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal\nclassification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the\nMulti-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that\nintegrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.\nSpecifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet\nBackbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement\nRouting (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature\nrepresentations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and\nglobal contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these\nmulti-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,\nequipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.\nFinally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by\nidentifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the\nsimple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the\nmost coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps\nachieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently\nsurpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with\nconfigurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)\nto a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in\nadvancing feature representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSPCaps\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u80f6\u56ca\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u7531\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CapsNet\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "MSPCaps\u5305\u542b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6ResNet\u4e3b\u5e72\u3001PatchifyCaps\u5c42\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8def\u7531\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "MSPCaps\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece344.3K\u523010.9M\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MSPCaps\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Existing\nacceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and\nbatch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a\nunified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies\nalong with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates\nthat dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and\ngradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher\nsparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)\nMemory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to\nVRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel\nachieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,\nwhile improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested\non CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with\nefficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns\nto allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision\ntraining, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint\nfrom 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with\ncustom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic\noptimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for\ndeployment across diverse computational environments.

While AI models have shown promise in this\ndomain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the\ninterpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the\ncomplexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization.

In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in\nFederated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data\nupdate scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data\nconservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate\nstaleness and volume of local data for best utilities.

Existing approaches based\non reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to\nextract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization\nacross object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains\n(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep\nCNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic\nfeature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,\nespecially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)\ncompresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding\ndiscriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification.

Additionally,\nwe show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger\ncounterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.\nCode and test datasets will be made publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/mailcorahul/f4-its", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aF4-ITS\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u98df\u7269\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u98df\u7269\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u589e\u957f\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u996e\u98df\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u53a8\u623f\u548c\u9910\u5385\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u548cVLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u9898\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cTop-1\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea610%\u548c7.7%\uff0cTop-K\u6210\u5206\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ea628.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "F4-ITS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

To\naddress this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel\ninteraction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense\nsupervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to\nguide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding\ncondition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as\nthe input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete\nthe coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In\naddition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features\nfrom both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental\nperception capability of each upsampled point.

Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic\n(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress.

The\nproposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues\nthrough four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based\nCNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning\nCNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial\nattention mechanism.

This technique significantly reduces the need for dense\nannotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as\nimage-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,\nWSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,\nespecially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an\nAdversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise\nproblem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each\ntraining iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using\nincorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.\nThis process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,\nnamely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as\nobject changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these\nadversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an\nonline global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted\nmoving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP\ncan be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding\nadditional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment\nAnything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance\nenhancements.

However, this\nreliance creates a significant attack surface.

Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped\nimage alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints\ncannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding\ncamera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D\nobjects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding\n(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the\nhuman subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective\nrelationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,\nwhich complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject\ndeviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the\ncropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a\ntransformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,\nthereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of\nmodel fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,\nPersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M\ndatasets.

Due to the rich\nvisual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,\nleading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant\nmemory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant\nvision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.\nHowever, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of\nsufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are\ninherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively\npruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a\nlayer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a\nPlug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision\ntokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring\nseamless integration with various models.

Moreover, drawing inspiration from the\nshape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via\nthe edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network\nto concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST\ntest set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.\nComprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more\nsensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,\nwith notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets.

The technical report for the paper titled \"Effective\n  Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs\" in SIGMOD 2026", "summary": "Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling\ndiverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade\nextensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions\ninclude (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node\nfeature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with\ncarefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without\nexplicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend\nDEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations.

While most existing detection methods\nprimarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake\ncontents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals\nin advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake\ndetection approach based on facial texture features.

To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation\n(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing\ngeneration efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely\nexisting parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable\nconditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert\n(CoMoE) module.

By enabling independent modeling of foreground features\nunder different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement\nand redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge\nthe information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose\nWeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective\ninteraction between global text-level control from the backbone and\nfine-grained control from conditional branches.

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly.

To\novercome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of\nhuman video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance\ngeneration. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure\ngenerator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining\nvideo appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated\nstructural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human\nstructures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate\ndense tracking constraints during training.

Federated learning (FL) offers a\nprivacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without\ncentralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems\nfaces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to\nnon-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by\nfrequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we\npropose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning\nframework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.\nFirst, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by\nminimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively\nmitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence\nstability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted\nAggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into\nthe aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model\nwhile significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse\nActivation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during\nthe aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from\nthe update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic\npruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper\ncompression while maintaining model accuracy.

Existing\nfine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,\nboth leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this\ndilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,\nwhich delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic\nparameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained\nto multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal\nfoundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this\nissue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights\nto measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving\ngeneralization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the\ntuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability.

Yang"], "title": "Rethinking Federated Learning Over the Air: The Blessing of Scaling Up", "comment": null, "summary": "Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple\nclients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced\ndistortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global\nparameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical\nframework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in\nlarge-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of\nscaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The\nmutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's\naggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)\nMitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the\nimpact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient.

Existing methods attempt to fuse visual\ninformation into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence\nlength issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within\nthe model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower\nvisual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an\nefficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and\nfusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the\ninherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and\nlanguage models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it\ndynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic\ngranularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The\nfused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being\ndirectly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding\nlayer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also\ndynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small\nnumber of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of\ncross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted\nexperiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering\non ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions.

Although\nrecent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated\ndetection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal\nglomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of\ndiseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not\nwithout consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological\ncharacteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the\nmost advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the\nchoice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for\nfine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of\naccurate classification and robust segmentation.\n  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed\nto enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of\nregions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both\nlong-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art\nmodels that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design\nthat reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions\nencountered in routine digital renal pathology.

However, they often fail to meet users'\nactual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across\nlong-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment\nRetrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,\ncomprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As\na foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue\nretrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each\nnaturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in\nreal-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising\nreal-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on\nthese resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image\nfragments.

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors.

Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation\nspace via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a\ngiven small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve\ninter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a\ngenerative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation\nmodel for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best\nof our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy\nspecifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD.

Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due\nto their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint\ndetector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the\nkeypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and\ncompact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a\ngated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss\nfunction to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built\nnew datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our\nmethod, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method\nachieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing\nmethods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss\nfunction improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,\nimprovements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For\n3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\\deg}, an RMSE of\n0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and\nreliability.

However, GNSS are highly vulnerable\nto spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead\nreceivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected\nnavigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most\nexisting spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques\nand struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this\nlimitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid\nQuantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS\nsignals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted\nduring the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT\nsolutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS\nreceivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,\nwhere attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time\ncomputations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen\ntime-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and\nsophisticated.

Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the\ncomputational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The\ntext-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token\npruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.\nHowever, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing\nlater in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's\noutput. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens\ncorresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning\nthat disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we\npresent an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency\nbias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting\nmechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their\nspatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual\nToken Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated\ninto existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model\narchitecture or extra training.

Classical\napproaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently\nlack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for\neach system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has\ninspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling\nalgorithms.

We prove that deep learning enables the design of\nscalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million\nparameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide\nmolecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws\nzero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,\nachieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,\nwhilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.\nThrough extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as\na proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance\nsampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to\nestablished methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides.

To further enhance these\nmodels' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as\na parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the\ngeneralization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing\n(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that\nprevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.\nThis inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,\nwe have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of\nprompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based\nLabel Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot\nlabels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.\nMoreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including\nClass-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide\ninter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical\nproperties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed.

Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,\nuncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one\nof the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step.

However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the\ndegenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been\nproposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only\nunimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent\nmultimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic\ncriterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this\nlimitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to\nselect informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first\nformulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.\nAfterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and\nthe original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be\nadopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision\npruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark\ndatasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text\ninformation are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass\nthe unimodal baseline with a clear margin.

These\ninconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and\nrealistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high\nfidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of\nhigh-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D\nimage inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of\nstate-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D\nobjects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose\nan adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,\nwe introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the\nquality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that\ncompared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and\nfine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of\n0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for\npractical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications.
