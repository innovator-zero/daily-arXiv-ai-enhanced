We propose a\nsimple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should\nalso be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of\nthought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher\nmodel's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow\nto deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and\nschedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT\ncorrelates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)\nDoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under\nmatched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given\nlight formatting controls.

In this study, we propose a\nmulti-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer\nembeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict\nthe drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting\nenvironmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,\nobject mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using\nsimulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift\ncoefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive\nthe net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time\nseries, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and\nobject-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a\nlanguage model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence\nlong-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift\ntrajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,\n$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different\nobjects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and\ntraditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and\ntemporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal\nmodels perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term\nforecasting in place of single-step prediction.

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based.

We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator.

By\ndemonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we\nposition our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the\nreliability of transformer-based NLP systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSALMAN\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u590d\u6742\u6270\u52a8\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDistance Mapping Distortion (DMD)\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6620\u5c04\u4ee5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u6613\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SALMAN\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this work, we provide a systematic study\nof how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and\nempirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a\ndominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected\nresponses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how\ncontrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen\nsamples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces\nto supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses.

FastAvatar uses a novel\nencoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity\npreservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face\n``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.\nSecond, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and\npose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict\nresiduals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the\ntemplate 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,\nmodel inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms\nexisting feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction\nquality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,\nFlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent\nspace design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing\nwhich is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation\nframework.

While federated learning enables\nprivacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains\nvulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.\nThese challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating\nzero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address\nthese challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated\nlearning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential\nprivacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and\nintegrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and\nsecure model parameters transmission.

While this sparsity improves\nefficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive\ncomputational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.\n  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor\nand neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy\nand efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through\nfiner-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training\nexpert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves\nthe mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference.

Additionally,\nwe address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.\nWe provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results\nthat our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of\nhigh-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u548cHessian\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u9009\u62e9\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86TuRBO\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f02\u8d28\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This work introduces a novel\ncontext-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal\nevents without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed\nhybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal\ndynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to\nextract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future\nrepresentations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based\nsemantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through\ncontext-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using\nInfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic\nrepresentations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by\nmodulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By\nintegrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system\ncan generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments.

Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual\nServoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the\nexistence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement\nnoise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual\nexperience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and\nuncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that\nguarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +\nstochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual\nmodel uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based\non uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization\nframework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a\nuncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given\nbased on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously\nformulated based on probabilistic approximation.

In this work, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the\nbarren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid\nregions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL\nalgorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal\nPolicy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as\nactions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based\noptimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization\nusing methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable\ninitial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions\nand tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method\nsignificantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.\nMoreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple\napproaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the\nflexibility and robustness of our method.

While explainable artificial\nintelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying\ninfluential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking\nstrategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance\nvia fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the\nunderlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations.

However, current RL systems continue\nto grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:\n(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time\nscaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in\nGPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation\noffer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.\n  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout\nresponses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based\non the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate\nRL training with two key innovations.

We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk\nassessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived\nfrom executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this\nframework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies\nnonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw\nteleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both\nacoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable\nthree-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and\nArousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),\nwe construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between\nscripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a\npronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not\nforecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the\nout-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility.

In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs\nsuggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand\nimages involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes.

When only \"catching\" is annotated, the\nother, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact\nmatching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,\naffecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid\npredictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a\nmultiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only\nground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are\nconstructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when \"catching\" is annotated, \"throwing\"\nis not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions).

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,\nwhich predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual\nperspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality\nconstraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has\nbeen largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based\nmodel reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two\nchallenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing\nthem can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to\npredict these critical constraints efficiently.

This work\nsystematically investigates how deep features improve tree species\nclassification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,\nwe extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites\ndata and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that\nfine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the\nNetherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This\ndemonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for\nthis task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for\ndata-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly\navailable satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly\nimproves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can\neffectively complement existing forest inventory processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8377\u5170\u56fd\u5bb6\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u5355\uff08NFI\uff09\u4e2d\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNFI\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9e\u5730\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u9065\u611f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u66f4\u65b0NFI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9065\u611f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6Sentinel-1\u3001Sentinel-2\u3001ERA5\u548cSRTM\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8377\u5170NFI\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982NFI\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u5355\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8865\u5145\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification\nwith fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to\ncapture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have\nadopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,\ninterval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,\nleaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a\nprior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a\nscalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the\ntemporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,\nenabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,\nwe introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and\nrecognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads.

Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art.

Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event\nprediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOCHA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u53d8\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6216\u4e00\u9636\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u6027\uff0cMOCHA\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MOCHA\u5c06\u591a\u9636\u5f71\u54cd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65f6\u53d8DAG\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u65e0\u73af\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMOCHA\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "MOCHA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often\nrely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and\ncapturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by\nintroducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local\nlatent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent\nspace.

To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized\ncustomization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset\nconsisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized\ncontent images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that\nsimultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style\nthrough two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and\ncontent-style disentanglement training.

However, MRI\nacquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and\nincreased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial\nresearch effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI\nacquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the\nfully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly\nreconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary\ngoal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing\ninterest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated\nMRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed\nin isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or\nprivate datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no\nhigh-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal\nstrategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper\nprovides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI\ndata comparing 7 approaches.

However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoofSeg\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u5c4b\u9876\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c4b\u9876\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u975e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoofSeg\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u6a21\u5757\uff08EAMM\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "RoofSeg\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5c4b\u9876\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "RoofSeg\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u548cTransformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

This paper presents a\nnew model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with\nNile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for\nmicroplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real\nhuman blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human\nsamples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN\nmodel integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation\nusing a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic\nfragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for\nsegmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy.

To improve the quality of\ngenerated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly\nused methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model\nto align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several\npre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the\ngenerated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple\nrewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing\nproperties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model\nfaithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this\ngap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and\ncomposition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies\nreward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained\nmodels. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the\nconstrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based\nprimal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image\ngeneration, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned\nor composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the\nequally-weighted approach.

However, progressively manipulating certain\nattributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains\nchallenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.\nSome studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.\nHowever, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is\ntrained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new\nattribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy\naccumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical\napplications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this\nissue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes\nthe text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute\ndirections. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling\ninterpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.\nMoreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports\nzero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and\nthe composition of multiple attributes.

To bridge this gap, \\textbf{we propose a framework designed to\ngenerate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also\nsemantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \\textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is\nbuilt upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions\nthat provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion\ngenerator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production\nof actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure\nthe effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality\nconflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel\nPseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to\naccurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby\ngenerating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and\nlinguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nleading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync\naccuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with\ntextual prompts.

On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS\n2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior\nuniversal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster\ntraining on 16-frame sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "AUSM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AUSM\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then\nreconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving\nunedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative\nmodels, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs\nprecise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for\nsynthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data\nfoundation for in-context 3D generation.
