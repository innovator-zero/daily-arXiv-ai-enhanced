Like the Jacob's\nLadder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible\ncables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner\nreminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by\nmotor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the\nopposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A\nphysics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to\nelucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle\nclearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a\nmaximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second.

We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the\nfirst framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node\nclassification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization\nand graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar\nlabels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily\nregimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the\nnode labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher\nlabel inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more\nprone to memorization.

However, building such a practical\nsystem that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains\nchallenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy\ncomputational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an\nautoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal\ncontrol and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal\nmodifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts\nmultimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs\nspatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising\nprocess of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale\ndialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing\nrich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep\ncompression autoencoder with up to 64$\\times$ reduction ratio, which\neffectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive\nmodel. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human\nsynthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach\nin low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability."}

However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

We prove that, under certain conditions, these \"quantum latent\ndistributions\" enable generative models to produce data distributions that\nclassical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide\nactionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in\nreal-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic\nquantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real\nphotonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent\ndistributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a\nrange of classical baselines. We also explore diffusion and flow matching\nmodels, identifying architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions.\nThis work confirms that near-term quantum processors can expand the\ncapabilities of deep generative models."}

Imbalanced multimodal\nlearning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is\ntypically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality.

We\nanalyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:\noptimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nIntra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM\naccounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths\nwithin the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning\nwithout hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.\nSpecifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters\ninto Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded\nblocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively\nprevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization\nof under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally,\nAIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively\nadjusts modulation strength at each depth.

To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network\nframework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity\nGraph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory\nand designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that\nsimultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the\nstability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable\nparameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on\ncomplex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both\nstructure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving\nadaptability across datasets and scenarios.

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and\nfilter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and\nselective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.\nOverall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields\nCNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering\npractical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments."}
