A\nphysics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to\nelucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle\nclearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a\nmaximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second.

Existing methods either target a single geo-entity\ntype or, like Poly2Vec, decompose entities into simpler components to enable\nFourier transformation, introducing high computational cost. Moreover, since\nthe transformed space lacks geometric alignment, these methods rely on uniform,\nnon-adaptive sampling, which blurs fine-grained features like edges and\nboundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geo2Vec, a novel method\ninspired by signed distance fields (SDF) that operates directly in the original\nspace. Geo2Vec adaptively samples points and encodes their signed distances\n(positive outside, negative inside), capturing geometry without decomposition.\nA neural network trained to approximate the SDF produces compact,\ngeometry-aware, and unified representations for all geo-entity types.\nAdditionally, we propose a rotation-invariant positional encoding to model\nhigh-frequency spatial variations and construct a structured and robust\nembedding space for downstream GeoAI models. Empirical results show that\nGeo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and\nlocation, capturing topological and distance relationships, and achieving\ngreater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications.

While AF\ndetection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage\nprogression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its\nsudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into\nsustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early\nprediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through\npreventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In\nthis study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR\nIntervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for\npositional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early\nprediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise\ntesting results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of\n0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932.

However, this process could fail and\nrestart the asymmetric bidirectional search due to the limitations of\nlazy-reverse search. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD\nGrafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge\nconnections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling\nrapid path convergence. G3T* employs a greedy approach using the minimum\nLebesgue measure of guided incremental local densification (GuILD) subsets to\noptimize paths efficiently. Furthermore, G3T* dynamically adjusts the sampling\ndistribution between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and\ncurrent cost improvements, ensuring asymptotic optimality. These features\nenhance the forward search's growth towards the reverse tree, achieving faster\nconvergence and lower solution costs. Benchmark experiments across dimensions\nfrom R^2 to R^8 and real-world robotic evaluations demonstrate G3T*'s superior\nperformance compared to existing single-query sampling-based planners.

In collaboration with Natural England,\na public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England,\nthis study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to\nground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18\nclasses defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed\nusing resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to\nbalance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed\nand fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label\nto each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated\nstrong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and\nF1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean\nF1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and\nPeat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or\nambiguous classes scoring lower.

However, building such a practical\nsystem that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains\nchallenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy\ncomputational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an\nautoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal\ncontrol and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal\nmodifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts\nmultimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs\nspatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising\nprocess of a diffusion head.

As it progresses, it leads to the deterioration of\ncognitive functions. Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for\nmanaging its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an\nintermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with\nAD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's\ndisease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle\ndifferences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose\nEffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a\nVision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI\nimages. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our\napproach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in\na more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the\nmodel's clinical reliability.

For each cancer type, we construct two\ncomplementary mutation signatures: a gene-level profile capturing nucleotide\nsubstitution patterns across the most frequently mutated genes, and a\nchromosome-level profile representing normalized substitution frequencies\nacross chromosomes. These dual views are encoded using TabNet encoders and\noptimized via a multi-scale contrastive learning objective (NT-Xent loss) to\nlearn unified cancer-type embeddings. We demonstrate that the resulting latent\nrepresentations yield biologically meaningful clusters of cancer types,\naligning with known mutational processes and tissue origins.

A\nsuccessful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have\nsome knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,\nand this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference\nsamples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$.

To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel\nsegmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a\nmultimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of\nMPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes\nand pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing\nsupervision at both structural and semantic levels.

For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections.

To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

To this end, we\nfirst introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for\ncollaborative perception.

A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter.

These issues arise because\nmost post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching\nand supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without\nexplicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human\nannotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot\nadapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to\nreward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method\nthat improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions\nvia reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two\nstages: visual perception and language reasoning.

However, the\ngeometric ambiguity inherent in a single 2D image and the scarcity of 3D human\ntraining data are the main obstacles limiting progress in this field. To\naddress these issues, current methods employ prior geometric estimation\nnetworks to derive various human geometric forms, such as the SMPL model and\nnormal maps. However, they struggle to integrate these modalities effectively,\nleading to view inconsistencies, such as facial distortions. To this end, we\npropose a two-process 3D human reconstruction framework, SAT, which seamlessly\nlearns various prior geometries in a unified manner and reconstructs\nhigh-quality textured 3D avatars as the final output.

Supervised\ndetectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial\npost-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level\nstatistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired,\nmodel-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a\ncommunity-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are\nfirst extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature\nvector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities\nare transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature,\nproducing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum\nexhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is\npresent. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack\nsuch gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male\nversus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic\ncounterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled\nsynthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves\nover 94% accuracy.

Philip Chen", "Tong Zhang"], "title": "AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning", "comment": "13pages,7 figures", "summary": "Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance\nbut still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal\nlearning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is\ntypically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we\nfind that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to\npromote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We\nanalyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:\noptimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nIntra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM\naccounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths\nwithin the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning\nwithout hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.\nSpecifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters\ninto Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded\nblocks for joint training with weaker modalities.

A common strategy involves learning a deformation field\nto model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However,\nthese deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine\nmotion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a\nsingle, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene\nreconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that\ndistinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D\nGaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their\ndeformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized\nmodeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs\nare treated as static to reduce computational costs.

Most existing methods rely on\ncomparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT,\nwhich are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not\nwell-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a\nnovel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based\non clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System\n(UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text\nreports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These\nentities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent,\ninterpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a\ntask-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of\nthe Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical\nrelationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically\nmeaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a\nradiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail\nsettings.

However, achieving robust segmentation remains challenging\ndue to the poor quality of ultrasound images and the lack of annotated data.\nSemi-supervised methods alleviate the lack of annotated data but struggle with\nthe unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images, making it\nchallenging to generate reliable pseudo-labels and enforce effective\nconsistency regularization constraints. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel semi-supervised framework, ERSR, for fetal head ultrasound segmentation.\nOur framework consists of the dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy, the\nellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and the symmetry-based multiple\nconsistency regularization.

The ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement refines these\nfiltered outputs by fitting least-squares ellipses, which strengthens pixels\nnear the center of the fitted ellipse and suppresses noise simultaneously. The\nsymmetry-based multiple consistency regularization enforces multi-level\nconsistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between original\npredictions and pseudo-labels, enabling the model to capture robust and stable\nshape representations.

Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile\nphones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work\nquantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability\nthrough such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street\nparking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,\nwe analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),\ncoordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized\noracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our\nnovel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior\nprobabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of\nhow close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to\nnavigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical\ndistances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a\nHungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity\nsimulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of\nCord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes\nfor non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx\nreduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,\nand up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u505c\u8f66\u52a9\u624bApp\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\uff08Cord-Approx\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u8def\u8fb9\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u673a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a9\u624b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u65e0\u534f\u8c03\u641c\u7d22\uff08Unc-Agn\uff09\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u505c\u8f66\u4f46\u65e0\u975e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u8bc6\uff08Cord-Agn\uff09\u3001\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u5168\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Cord-Oracle\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Cord-Approx\u7b56\u7565\u3002Cord-Approx\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u5360\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u914d\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9a6c\u5fb7\u91cc\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0cCord-Approx\u7528\u6237\u5e73\u5747\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a6.69\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u6bd4\u975e\u7528\u6237\u5feb72%-73%\u3002", "conclusion": "Cord-Approx\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u505c\u8f66\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u548c\u4f4f\u5b85\u533a\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly\nmodeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action\nprediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual\nscene, while video prediction models generate future frames without\nconditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or\ncontextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified\ntwo-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in\negocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we\nperform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual\nobservations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand\ntrajectories.

Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we\nquickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream\ninference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and\nchain-of-thought reasoning.

Then, we apply this\nestimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the\nsampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and\nselect $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing\nmodel outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative\nto model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models\nand datasets validate the efficiency of our approach.

The quadratic computational\ncomplexity of window self-attention mechanisms in many transformer-based SR\nmethods forces the use of small, fixed windows, limiting the receptive field.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach by embedding the wavelet transform\nwithin a hierarchical transformer framework, called (WaveHiT-SR). First, using\nadaptive hierarchical windows instead of static small windows allows to capture\nfeatures across different levels and greatly improve the ability to model\nlong-range dependencies. Secondly, the proposed model utilizes wavelet\ntransforms to decompose images into multiple frequency subbands, allowing the\nnetwork to focus on both global and local features while preserving structural\ndetails. By progressively reconstructing high-resolution images through\nhierarchical processing, the network reduces computational complexity without\nsacrificing performance.

Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a\njoint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these\nmethods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,\nwhich rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as\nurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather\nfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where\nonly partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this\nsource of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current\nresearch. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy\nCorrespondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to\nbridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this\nend, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a\nnovel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated\ndata uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential\nco-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high\ncorrespondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature\nlearning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from\ntraditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty\nand loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing\nrobust supervision for noisy samples.

To address this gap, we propose\nAudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)\nwith TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory\npossesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It\nemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered\nsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and\nemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)\nDecoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser\ncollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for\nintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence\npreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension\nand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory\neliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy\nbetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,\nencompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound\nnarratives.
