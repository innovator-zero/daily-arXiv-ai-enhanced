This study introduces a\nnovel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert\ncharacterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language\nrepresentations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with\npre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual\nmicrostructural data and textual expert assessments into shared\nrepresentations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we\ndevelop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both\npositive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their\nassociated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of\npreviously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.\nValidation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and\ndefective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria.

To address this challenge, we propose a\nlanguage-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates\nsemantic perception and spatial reasoning.

For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we\nintroduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting\nwith distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.\nComprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our\nframework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search\nefficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies.

In this work, we introduce a probing framework\nto systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across\nlayers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories\n(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a\nstandardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall\nstage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,\ninstruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation\nto each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture.

However,\ntransferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the\nsim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can\ndegrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization\nand Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle\nunder out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In\nthis work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of\nrelying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly\nadapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve\nthis, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies\nresidual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a\ndifferentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework\nrefines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled\neffects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics\nmodel is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient\nbackpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy\nupdates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO.

This improves the detection of\npedestrians with vastly different scales between views.

We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input.

However, the\nrarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of\ndeep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain\nrandomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a\nsynthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations\nfrom healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without\nrequiring pathological annotations.\n  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with\nCCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on\nCCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with\nother pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically\nrelevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show\ntheir utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed\naugmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in\nhealthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases.

Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising\nresults in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for\nlabeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation\ncosts by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting\nhigh-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous\nactive domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by\nselecting samples that are farthest from the source domain.

Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to\nthe quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms\nof LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a\nnovel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at\nan early stage.

While\nthe LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still\nface this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are\nless effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.\nFurthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks\nrelationships of weight values within rows or columns.

This algorithm achieved\nfeasible classification accuracy (91.2\\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using\nResnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data\nstream DA scenario (+6.7\\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also\ndemonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when\nevaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets.

In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field\nshould be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,\ngathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its\ncontent into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable\nto bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied\nremedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate\nover-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global\ntopology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph\nstructure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This\nstudy presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate\nthe effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global\nstructure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the\nnode centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,\nthe proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with\nlikely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across\nselected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without\nadding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve\nperformance on graph and node classification tasks.

However, existing\nmethods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly\nconstructed.

To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a\nnovel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and\nconsistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head\nregions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the\nSubject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy\n(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize\nidentity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal\ninputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric\nalignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the\nlater employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,\neffectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive\nexperiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,\nphotometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack\nsignificantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving\nfrontal fidelity.

However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel\nvariations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based\nphysical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile\nscenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation\nusing IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated\nbased on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance\ncorrelation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of\nmanually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial\ncorrelation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their\nsimilarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and\nexperimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT\ndevelopment kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both\nsimulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization\nperformance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent\nauthentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,\nour proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to\nthe fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06\ncompared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42CSI\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cCNN-Siamese\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528WLAN TGn\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CNN-Siamese\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60CSI\u5bf9\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65b9\u6848\u5728AUC\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eFCN-Siamese\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, aligning their output\ndistributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,\ncompositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to\nthese generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion\nmodels and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after\nfine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models\nthrough the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward\nconditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an\ninference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining\nthe outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically\nequivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL\nobjectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off\nwithout further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG\nconsistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various\narchitectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human\npreferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.\nFurthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby\noffering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment.

Although supervised methods achieve higher\naccuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for\nreal-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.\nHowever, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited\nreasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions\nor detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel\nzero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with\nspatial information for target object reasoning.

For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a\nVLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or\na blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails\nto capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained\nsignificant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot\nclassifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively\nwith CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the\ngenerative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation\nabilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --\nDiffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with\nattributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised\nzero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion\nClassifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models\nstruggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader\nchallenges VLMs face with relational reasoning.

However, current detection methods often\nyield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion\nmorphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow\nwhere dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed\ntooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training\nnetwork for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing\nautomated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view\nfrom panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then\npretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The\nglobal-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating\nregion proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts\ndetailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the\nregion proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we\nintroduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically\nfuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the\nfused features back into the detection model for final caries detection.

These\nblack-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on\nshallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly\ndecouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language\ncausal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human\ncognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level\nvideo content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and\nlogically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal\nChain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,\nand a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in\nthese chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a\nscalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing\ndatasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation\nmetric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and\ngeneralization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine\nacross diverse domains.

Second,\nthey largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is\nessential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in\nhandwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot\nhandwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent\ntext from a single example.

However, accurately localizing the\nmanipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the\nmain barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe\nlack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily\navailable web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images\nfrom the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a\nsimpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and\naccurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve\nannotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out\nunreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually\nforged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than\nexisting handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object\nJitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating\nhigh-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a\nnew model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for\nthe image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and\nsignificantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world\nforgery benchmarks.

LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an\ninformation-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data\nmemorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against\neight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,\nwe evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining\nis impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the\nnovel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable\nevaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that\nLoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and\neffectiveness.
