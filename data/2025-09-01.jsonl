To evaluate GENNAV,\nwe constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three\ndistinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV\nachieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation\nmetrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles\noperated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot\ntransfer performance.

In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to\ndrive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy\ncode generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to\nunveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled\nrobotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation\ntask and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive\nexperiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in\ntwo prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable\nbehaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed\ncharacterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight\nfor practical development to reduce unreliability.

To overcome this limitation, machine\nunlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove\nsensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.\nRecently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by\nintegrating LoRA adapters.

The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as\nopen-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the\ncommunity to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets."}

However, their performance degrades sharply on harder\ninstances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental\narchitectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation\nthrough the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local\nconnectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random\nk-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature\ndecreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based\nSAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range\ndependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.\nWe validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm\nthat curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used\nto predict performance.

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries.

We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked\nto navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to\ntargets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead\nto deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of\ninterest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\\times K}$ cost structure that\ndescribes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport\nthen provides \\textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the\nrobots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling\nconsiderations. The proposed solution requires $\\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\\log K)$\ncomputations in the worst-case and $\\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\\log K)$ for\nwell-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping\ntrajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we\nshow that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with\nthe help of \\textit{replans} and \\textit{model predictive control}."}

These images can be\nviewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,\nincluding pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.\nThey are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,\nmicrobiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic\nscience.\n  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it\nis essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently\nno standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through\nmanual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several\nmillion objects.\n  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a\nprofiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this\napproach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics\nto achieve interoperability between different catalogs.\n  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that\nprovides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is\norganized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,\nwith each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.\n  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard\nthrough specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and\ngraph-based WSI representations."}

Unveiling the Bigger Picture through Line-Level OCR", "comment": "11 pages. Project Website:\n  https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website", "summary": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With\ncontinuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds\npotential to exploit such advances. Project Website:\nhttps://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website"}

Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently\nchallenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while\nstandard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,\nthis can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of\ndomain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead\nhypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective\ndomain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and\nenhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head\nand synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages\ndomain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain\nfeatures. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging\nevaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more\nOOD."}

We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the\nunder-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos\nrepresent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in\nmany applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in\nunsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised\ncontinual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,\nwhile having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we\nstudy the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more\nchallenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of\nprocessing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark\nexperimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured\nvideo data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised\nvideo transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of\nthe data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task\ndata, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture\nnew knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of\ntransfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge\ntransfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology\nsubstantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning\nmany tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action\nrecognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,\nwithout using any labels or class boundaries."}

GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been\nspecifically marketed towards oncology use.\n  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the\nACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300\nmultiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation\noncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment\nindications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate\nconcise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated\ncorrectness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations.

Domain-specific gains were\nmost pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's\ntreatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%\nCI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).\nHallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their\npresence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \\k{appa} 0.083 for\ncorrectness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors\nclustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed\nclinical adaptation.\n  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation\noncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable\nperformance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment\nrecommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.\nWhile hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors\nunderscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert\noversight before clinical implementation."}
