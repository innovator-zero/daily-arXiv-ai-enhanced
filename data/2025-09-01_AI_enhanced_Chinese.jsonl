Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are\nco-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable\nprogress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve\nhuman-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,\nintroduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is\na unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in\nmultimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved\nvision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key\npillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs\nindiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,\nhigh-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains\nover 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action\ncomprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive\ndecoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot\naction generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for\nopen-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of\nlong-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments.

A non-linear single-track\nvehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force\nconstraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability\nduring evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal\nacceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to\ncontrol the vehicle.

In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to\ndrive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy\ncode generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to\nunveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled\nrobotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation\ntask and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive\nexperiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in\ntwo prominent frameworks.

We then comprehensively analyze RL\napplications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,\ndiagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and\ntranslational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze\nRL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons\nfor safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a\ntechnical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative\nrole in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical\nintelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u533b\u7597AI\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800cRL\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u5e26\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86RL\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e0e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u53ca\u5728\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u3001\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "RL\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u533b\u7597AI\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u667a\u80fd\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4eba\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

However, when computed independently at different\nlayers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons\nunreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation\nVector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically\nconsistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align\nconcept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion\nmechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method\nsignificantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept\nrelevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation\nVectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We\nconduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating\nthat our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,\nenhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial\nperturbations.

These facilities\ncontain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long\nperiods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and\nthreaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep\nSpace Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment\nwith different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly\npinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and\ncontinue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space\nmissions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine\nlearning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive\nanalysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets\nthrough statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained\nand tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a\nreinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on\nseverity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each\nanomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time\nthrough human feedback/input.

This provides an interesting use\ncase to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in\nthe vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation\nbased on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how\npedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into\nthe implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and\nacceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,\na model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction\n(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,\nit is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and\ndecision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used\nframework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept\nfor an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model\nto learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL\nagent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a\nrisk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model\nlearned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and\nthereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the\nmodelled pedestrian.

Traditional HMR methods are\ndesigned to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these\nmethods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to\nimprove alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly\naccount for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In\ncontrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's\nbody shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned\non that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose\nprior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides\nthe pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose\nprior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D\nconstraints.

Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,\nrequiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile\nplug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose\nestimators to enhance their performance.

Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that\nHTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\\%, inference MACs by 56.8\\%, and improves\ninference speed by an average of 81.1\\% compared to prior diffusion-based\nmethods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff08HTP\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u526a\u679d\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u805a\u7126\u65f6\u95f4MHSA\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u59ff\u6001\u6807\u8bb0\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-INF-3DHP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534781.1%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "HTP\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities.

However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over\nextended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task\nof generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series\nexhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also\nundergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term\ndependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the\nother hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships\nbetween different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing\nboth intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important\nchallenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative\nmodel for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through\nstage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model\npreserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data\ndistribution shifts.

The expected value averages the\nperformance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying\nthe agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the\nperformance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing\nthe long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.\nIn this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard\nensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term\nperformance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator\nfor the time-average growth rate.

To implement this, we\npropose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to\n(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out\nirrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation.

Project Website:\n  https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website", "summary": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines.

By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions\n(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we\ndemonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in\nerror reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic\ngrid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and\nexpert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic\nperformance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs\nconsistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical\napplications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a\nparadigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven\nflexibility with first-principles rigor.

To\nstudy how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into\nthe model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key\ntasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel\ncategory discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found\nthat even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently\nimprove performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that\nincreasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD\ndetection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more\nsemantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance\ncompared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the\nsemantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to\nunseen action classes.

GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been\nspecifically marketed towards oncology use.\n  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the\nACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300\nmultiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation\noncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment\nindications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate\nconcise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated\ncorrectness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations.

Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research.

Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of\nreal-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,\nParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that\nour model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,\nrespectively.
