People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly\ndiagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health\ncomplications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is\nthat's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we\nhave conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language\nmodels (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral\npatterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric\npatients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine\nlearning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to\nassess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient\ntool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in\nrescue cases."}

This research evaluates 13 trajectory\nreconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using\nhigh-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four\ncritical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on\nreconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of\nthese methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the\ntrade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework\ncombines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity\nwith practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning\nvelocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed\nvariability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each\nmethod in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations.

The velocity\nconstrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)\nyields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency.

Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

Therefore, Task and Motion\nPlanning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or\neven in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete\naction sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In\nthis paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,\nreferred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different\nscenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,\nwhich expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop\nmotion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,\nTMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a\ncertain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate\nfor unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled\nautonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)\nbounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of\nunfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative\npaths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We\nuse a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous\nrobots.

Finally, we demonstrate resilience\nof the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining\nartifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but\nalso addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for\ndigital pathology.

As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the\nclient side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges\nfor training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first\nto easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,\nclient-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased\npatterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,\nthe curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic\nknowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves\nweighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained\nstructural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior\nperformance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git."}

By combining deep point tracking with\na factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated\npart trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To\nfoster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first\nego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions\nat a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera\nposes. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based\nbaselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D.

This drives the need for robust\nfine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse\nlabeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties\nthat complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training\ndatasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which\nrequire enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse\nobjectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better\nunderstand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we\nclassify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,\nrepresentation-based, and partial fine-tuning.

Since degradation\nis rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate\nhealth assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because\noperational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces\nonly subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect\nshort-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the\nunderlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but\nthe residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in\nnoisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with\ndynamic responses.

Based on the rigid\nbody TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model\nare derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.\nBuilding directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for\nbase parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points\nprinciple, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms\nare developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core\nalgorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),\nachieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity\npreprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed\nmethod and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a\n2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all\ncases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base\nparameters.

Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The\nStability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance\nbetween the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The\nResource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on\nextensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource\nburden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies\nnot in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically\nmodulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that\nlightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning\nprocess. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive\nModulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new\npath for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural\nSynapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to\nstore expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these\nmodulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a\nsimilar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it\nselects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a\nfrozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its\ninternal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.\nExtensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets.

Although existing works have recognized this\nproblem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as\nexisting approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses\nto validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms.

Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation\nFramework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial\nstructure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes\nclinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)\nmodule further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from\nthe skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nVisualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues\nto guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual\nrepresentations.

Each token\nembedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that\nintegrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,\neach token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens\nthat summarize the input history.

In this paper, we relax\nthese out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes\nperformative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential\ntheoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of\nperformative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to\nnonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution\nshift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two\ndistributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the\nperformative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for\nboth linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a\ncritical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these\ntheoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative\nstability of the predictive model.

To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we\nintroduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated\nfrequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from\npre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a\nvisual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes\ninto the degraded generation process.

In\naddition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix\nto recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.\nFinally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to\nsolve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates\nsignificantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the\nability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential\nto cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks."}

For the bivariate categorical setup with\nDirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled\nsynthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ\ntwo simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or\nconditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal\ndiscovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.\nWe additionally show how the biases can be controlled.

To\naddress these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based\napproach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced\ninterference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images\ninto a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model\nthat iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then\ndecoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images.

Unlike previous event-based\nensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion\nstrategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting\nconditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative\nimprovement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach\non two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric\nsubsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration\nthat influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key\ndesign choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction\nmethods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for\nrobust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard\nsequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence\nlengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and\nbenchmarking framework."}

This discrepancy arises because traditional exams\nfail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework\nthat moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,\nhigh-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework\ncomprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic\nclinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical\nRubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation\nmetrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter\nmedical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement\nlearning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nalgorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other\nopen-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a\nscore above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously\nexceeded only by GPT-5.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space\nthroughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the\nflexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,\nboth of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.\nIn the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground\nand background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional\ncontextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level\nfeatures. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the\noriginal reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a\nfeature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental\nresults show that our method significantly improves the performance of\ndifferent SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets."}

To ensure texture\nconsistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the\ntextures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.\nFor enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve\nthe 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also\nconditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to\nreconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as\nshark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1.

In this work, we present a\nsystematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural\nperspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,\nand video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial\nUnderstanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of\nspatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the\nupper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial\nimagination.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data.

Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)\nmethods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the\nnon-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their\nderivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks\ndiscretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead\nto accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths.

Traditional bias\nmitigation techniques often lead to a {\\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby\nimproving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced\nperformance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation\nthrough Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the\nprinciples of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that\nmitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual\nlearning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,\nimproving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge\nthat benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as\nLearning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret\nbias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models\nto incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for\ndisadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by\ndiverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates\nbiases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge.

However, the labeling process, especially for\nordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is\nprone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the\nperformance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions\n(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.\nFor instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean\nabsolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to\n0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic\nnoise present in the original datasets.

Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations.

Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography.
