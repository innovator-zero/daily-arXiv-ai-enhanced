### [2] [AMMKD: Adaptive Multimodal Multi-teacher Distillation for Lightweight Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00039)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD框架通过多模态特征融合、多教师蒸馏和自适应优化，实现了轻量高效的图像-文本检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备上部署时因模型大小和计算复杂度高而受限的问题。

Method: 结合多模态特征融合网络、多教师知识蒸馏框架（使用两个CLIP教师模型）、KL散度匹配和自适应动态加权方案。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，同时显著降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效且灵活，适用于轻量级图像-文本检索任务。

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

*Xiang Li,Chong Zhang,Hongpeng Wang,Shreyank Narayana Gowda,Yushi Li,Xiaobo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的二维可持续性评估系统，用于平衡深度学习模型训练的性能与能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型训练中高碳排放问题，平衡算法性能与能源消耗。

Result: 实验证明该系统能定量评估跨任务算法，推动绿色AI研究从理论转向实践。

Conclusion: 该框架为行业建立算法能效标准提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

### [5] [MESTI-MEGANet: Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image and Micro-expression Gradient Attention Networks for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00056)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的动态输入模态MESTI和网络MEGANet，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态难以捕捉微表情的细微和短暂特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 引入MESTI作为输入模态，结合MEGANet的梯度注意力块提取精细运动特征。

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最高准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MESTI和MEGANet的组合为微表情识别提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一种生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构的模型，通过离散扩散语言模型实现，解决了内存和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构面临内存立方级增长和类别不平衡的挑战。

Method: 将体素视为标记，使用离散扩散语言模型生成3D结构。

Result: 在3D-Craft数据集上生成逼真且连贯的结构，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 离散扩散是3D稀疏体素生成建模的有前景框架。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SGLC的新框架，用于高分辨率图像去雾，结合全局和局部特征，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，主要因难以结合全局上下文与局部细节。

Method: SGLC框架包含全局特征生成器（GFG）和局部特征增强器（LFE），分别处理全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明，SGLC在高分辨率数据集上显著提升了PSNR。

Conclusion: SGLC是一种模型无关的框架，可显著提升高分辨率图像去雾的视觉保真度。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种大规模自监督异常检测模型，用于肾脏毒理学病理学检测，旨在减少药物安全评估中的时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物开发中需要检测肾脏异常，传统方法耗时且昂贵，需要检查大量正常切片以发现细微变化。

Method: 使用UNI基础模型提取特征，结合自监督方法改进异常检测性能。

Result: 自监督方法在ROC曲线下面积为0.62，阴性预测值为89%，优于随机分类。

Conclusion: 该模型有望用于排除正常切片，降低药物开发成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在标准自然图像上表现优异，但在复杂环境（如变形物体）中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出新型废物分类数据集，并设计深度评估方法测试VLLMs。

Result: 研究发现VLLMs在复杂环境中表现不足，需进一步提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调了改进VLLMs在复杂环境中性能的重要性，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两步法，通过生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，再结合视觉模型估计图像相似性，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉与语言模型（如CLIP）在文本和图像表示空间上存在模态差距，限制了检索性能。

Method: 1. 使用生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2. 结合视觉模型估计图像相似性；3. 引入聚合网络融合多模态查询。

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法显著优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合生成模型和视觉模型，有效缩小模态差距，提升文本到图像检索性能。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PRISM基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理视觉语言任务时可能泄露敏感的生物特征信息，但目前缺乏公开的数据集或基准来评估和缓解这一问题。

Method: 作者开发了PRISM基准来评估MLLMs在拒绝生物特征相关查询和避免隐含生物特征泄露方面的能力，并创建了Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地移除生物特征信息来保护隐私。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs存在广泛的生物特征泄露问题，而基于Safe-LLaVA数据集微调的模型显著减少了泄露。

Conclusion: PRISM和Safe-LLaVA为隐私对齐的MLLM开发和评估设立了新标准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME是一种新型跨模态对齐方法，通过构建以自我为中心的世界模型，提升在未知场景中的泛化能力，显著改善了动态环境中的推理和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在动态、开放集任务中的时空推理和适应能力不足，VEME旨在解决这一问题。

Method: VEME整合了跨模态对齐框架、动态隐式认知地图和基于指令的导航推理框架，以增强时空推理和规划。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE上的实验显示，VEME比传统方法在准确性和探索效率上提高了1%-3%。

Conclusion: VEME通过时空经验嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的推理和规划能力。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，结合乳腺超声图像和临床数据，提高叶状肿瘤的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤（PTs）在术前难以分类，常导致不必要的手术切除，因此需要更准确的诊断方法。

Method: 开发了一种双分支神经网络，融合超声图像和患者元数据特征，采用类感知采样和分层交叉验证。

Result: 多模态方法在分类良性与交界性/恶性PTs上优于单模态基线，ConvNeXt和ResNet18表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多模态AI有潜力作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要的活检并改善临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FHT2SP的快速且高精度的Hough变换算法，结合了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Hough变换算法在计算复杂度和精度之间存在权衡，快速算法（如FHT2DT）牺牲精度，而高精度算法计算成本高。本文旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，扩展至任意形状，并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过调整超像素大小实现高效计算。

Result: FHT2SP算法在图像尺寸为w×h时，计算复杂度接近最优（O(wh ln³ w)），且误差恒定可控。

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于大规模图像处理。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前转导式少样本学习在视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中的应用较少，需要针对VLMs的定制方法。

Method: 提出LIMO损失函数，结合视觉输入与文本描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚和交叉熵损失，并探索PEFT策略。

Result: LIMO大幅超越现有转导式少样本CLIP方法，并显著优于最佳归纳方法。

Conclusion: LIMO展示了在转导式少样本学习中调整模型参数的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Motivation: 解决计算病理学中因组织制备、染色和成像条件差异导致的领域泛化问题，模仿病理学家依赖的领域不变形态特征。

Method: 结合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码，在监督对比学习框架中对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表示，并引入随机权重平均（SWA）增强鲁棒性。

Result: MorphGen在图像损坏和对抗攻击下表现出鲁棒性，提升了OOD泛化能力。

Conclusion: MorphGen不仅提升了领域泛化能力，还解决了数字病理学中深度学习系统的关键漏洞。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Motivation: 现有令牌剪枝方法依赖高成本校准或次优重要性度量，导致冗余令牌保留，影响效率。

Method: 提出基于互信息的视觉令牌剪枝策略，去除与文本令牌语义不对齐的视觉令牌，并通过最大化嵌入空间中的成对距离进一步剪枝冗余令牌。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态模型中令牌冗余问题，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的优越性、可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Motivation: 现有方法忽视目标域文本描述这一可用资源，导致单域泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出STAR模块，利用CLIP等视觉语言模型，通过目标锚定子空间和谱投影对齐目标语义，并结合特征空间Mixup。

Result: 在图像分类和目标检测任务中，STAR表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 目标域文本描述能显著提升模型在数据受限环境下的泛化能力，为部署鲁棒模型提供新思路。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）通常存在于低维子空间中，但如何有效利用其物理特性（如低秩和稀疏表示）进行去噪并保留细节是一个挑战。

Method: 提出ILRNet，将秩最小化模块（RMM）嵌入U-Net架构中，利用小波变换和奇异值阈值处理低频成分，并通过自适应学习参数和迭代细化过程优化去噪效果。

Result: 实验表明，ILRNet在合成和真实噪声去除任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ILRNet通过结合模型驱动和数据驱动的优势，有效解决了HSI去噪问题，并在细节保留和去噪效果上表现出色。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前物体幻觉研究的盲点，为开发更鲁棒的幻觉缓解策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Result: SPO-VLM有效提升对抗攻击的安全性，同时保持良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM在效率和效果间取得平衡，支持安全且语义一致的文本生成。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: APPT为跨模态3D点云分析提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NoiseCutMix的新数据增强方法，结合了CutMix和扩散模型的优势，生成自然且高分辨率的融合图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在多类图像融合时会产生不自然的边界，因此需要一种更自然的数据增强方法。

Method: 在扩散模型中部分结合两类估计噪声，生成具有两类特征的融合图像。

Result: 实验表明，NoiseCutMix在分类任务中优于传统数据增强方法和随机生成的图像。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix是一种有效的多类图像融合数据增强方法，能够生成自然且高分辨率的图像。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

TL;DR: 提出两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法（UDAKD和FSKD），利用2D图像模型减少3D LiDAR点云标注需求，提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云标注成本高且耗时，而2D图像数据丰富且易获取，因此探索跨模态知识蒸馏以减少标注负担。

Method: 通过预训练2D图像模型与3D点云数据对齐，利用UDAKD和FSKD方法进行跨模态知识蒸馏，保留模态通用信息。

Result: 实验验证方法有效性，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 跨模态知识蒸馏可显著减少3D标注需求，同时提升语义分割效果。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统叙事分析需要将多种数据形式转化为手写叙事，给研究人员和参与者带来巨大负担，需要更高效和友好的方法。

Method: 开发了NAME范式，包括角色定位和形状模块，以及评估生成图像感知质量和叙事一致性的指标。

Result: 在仅使用0.96%数据的情况下，FID分数从195降至152；在不同数据分割方案下均表现优异。

Conclusion: NAME范式显著提升了叙事分析的效率和效果，为领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

TL;DR: HERO-VQL是一种针对自我中心视频中物体查询定位的新方法，通过引入分层注意力机制和增强训练策略，显著提升了定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁的视角变化和部分遮挡导致现有方法难以准确定位物体，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出了HERO-VQL方法，包括Top-down Attention Guidance（TAG）和Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training（EgoACT），分别优化注意力机制和增强训练多样性。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的实验表明，HERO-VQL显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL通过结合认知启发的方法和增强训练，有效解决了自我中心视频中的物体定位挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双约束扩散模型（DCDM），用于超低剂量PET重建，减少训练参数并提高灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露，但可能导致图像质量下降，需要一种高效且灵活的重建方法。

Method: DCDM冻结预训练扩散模型权重，引入可训练的双约束控制器（NTC和ENC），分别用于特征提取和模型控制。

Result: 在UDPET和临床数据集上，DCDM在已知和未知剂量减少因子（DRF）下均优于现有方法，适用于超低剂量（如1%全剂量）。

Conclusion: DCDM是一种高效且灵活的PET重建方法，适用于超低剂量场景，具有临床价值。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对全景视频修复的深度学习模型DAOVI，解决了现有方法在处理全景视频时的几何失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景视频的广视角常导致不需要的物体出现，现有方法未解决其投影失真问题。

Method: DAOVI引入基于测地距离的时空运动评估模块和深度感知特征传播模块。

Result: 实验表明，DAOVI在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI有效解决了全景视频修复中的失真问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉动态细节或生成新视角时表现不足，主要因模型表示能力有限和数据不足。

Result: 实验显示方法优于现有技术，验证了策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过生成模型和互补策略，显著提升了化身重建的细节和视角一致性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可加速现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）推理的方法，通过分层合并令牌和压缩KV缓存，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs推理过程效率低，尤其是在编码和解码阶段，需要一种无需训练的高效加速方法。

Method: 将VLMs推理分为编码和解码两阶段：编码阶段采用金字塔令牌合并减少令牌数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩减少延迟。

Result: 实验显示，LightVLM在保留35%图像令牌时性能100%，3%时98%，网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM显著提升VLMs推理效率，使大模型比小模型更快，有望推动实际部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Method: 提出SemaMIL，通过语义重排序（SR）聚类相似图像块，结合语义引导检索状态空间模块（SRSM）优化全局建模。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上，SemaMIL以更少计算量和参数实现最优准确率。

Conclusion: SemaMIL有效平衡计算效率与模型性能，为计算病理学提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Conclusion: SA-LDL通过阶段化建模标签模糊性，显著提升了年龄估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Conclusion: EOIR在保持精度的同时提供了更好的效率和平滑度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

Motivation: 现有视频领域的MRMs评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，亟需一个更全面的基准来推动MRMs的发展。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建了包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，覆盖四个核心视频理解维度，并评估了28种MRMs的性能。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o的总体准确率仅为57.0%，开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究还揭示了RL训练、推理时缩放和视频帧数对MRMs性能的影响。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域的MRMs评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Conclusion: STVH和M-STVH能有效解决细粒度视频检索问题。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像风格差异导致下游任务性能下降，现有UI2I方法未明确筛选相关风格特征。

Method: 提出TRUST框架，包含令牌驱动模块（数据视角和模型视角）和辅助提示注入，确保内容与风格分离。

Result: 在超声数据集上，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能上优于现有UI2I方法。

Conclusion: TRUST通过优化风格选择，显著提升了跨设备超声图像的转换效果。

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Conclusion: ATGC有效解决了黑盒模型训练本地模型的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语言引导的解缠框架（LBD），用于解决类增量语义分割中的语义纠缠问题，通过预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）引导特征解缠，并在多步场景中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量语义分割（CISS）中，现有方法在增量过程中存在语义错位和动态数据演化导致的语义纠缠问题，导致噪声和错误。

Method: 提出LBD框架，利用预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的语义先验，通过语言引导的原型解缠和流形互背景解缠，实现特征自主解缠。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上，特别是在多步场景中，取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，并通过软提示调优和编码器适配进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

Motivation: 现有学习方法在未校准的模态（如MRI）中泛化能力差，限制了其在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出“轻度到重度”的受试者内生成和“真实-合成”混合训练策略，增强模型对图像外观变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上验证了BrainFM在五种基础脑成像任务中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM展示了在多样化临床协议中的广泛适用性和高性能。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

Motivation: 在细粒度目标检测任务中，现有方法（如DiffusionDet）因依赖局部特征而性能受限，尤其是在上下文依赖的场景中。

Method: 引入CAF框架，利用交叉注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提案特征直接融合，通过专用编码器捕获全局环境信息。

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中，CAF显著优于现有最先进模型，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测设立了新标杆。

Conclusion: CAF通过全局与局部特征的融合，有效提升了细粒度目标检测的性能，尤其在上下文依赖的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架通过解耦和对齐策略，有效解决了视觉语言模型在遥感分割任务中的迁移问题，为多模态理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，快速检测对减缓气候变化至关重要。传统方法依赖预处理步骤，新方法旨在简化流程。

Method: 使用未正交校正数据（UnorthoDOS）训练机器学习模型，并与传统正交校正数据方法对比。

Result: 新方法性能与传统方法相当，且正交校正数据训练的模型优于基线（mag1c）。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了甲烷检测流程，同时保持了性能，为快速响应系统提供了支持。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

Method: 提出多视角状态空间建模框架MV-SSM，通过特征级和关键点级联合建模，并引入投影状态空间块（PSS）和网格令牌引导的双向扫描（GTBS）。

Conclusion: MV-SSM通过创新的状态空间建模和扫描策略，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化性能和准确性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Conclusion: 异构专家编码器的组合是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的有效途径，为下一代AI系统设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Conclusion: STM策略在恶劣天气条件下实现了高效的深度估计，同时保留了预训练模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅在批评任务中表现优异，还在生成任务中超越专业视觉语言模型，平均提升5.7%。扩展后的LLaVA-Critic-R1+在MMMU上达到71.9的SoTA性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，批评数据的强化学习训练可以产生一个在评估和生成任务中均表现出色的统一模型，为可扩展的自改进多模态系统提供了简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Conclusion: CSFMamba有效结合Mamba的低计算负担和多模态融合潜力，为遥感图像分类提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Method: 采用两阶段级联Transformer框架，包括掩码预训练阶段和针对动作分类的微调阶段。

Result: 在Penn Action、N-UCLA和NTU RGB+D 60数据集上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: CascadeFormer为骨架动作识别提供了新方法，并开源代码以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

### [60] [Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00700)
*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估视觉语言模型（VLM）投影层泛化能力的新基准，发现其在未见概念上表现良好，并揭示了其工作机制类似键值记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 投影层在VLM中至关重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未系统评估。

Method: 通过调整目标检测数据集为提示格式，设计训练/测试分割以控制概念分离，评估投影层性能。

Result: 投影层在未见类上保留79-88%的性能，工作机制类似键值记忆。

Conclusion: 研究提出了评估对齐泛化的新框架，并展示了有限对齐数据下高效训练VLM的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VGG和Vision Transformer的公平性算法，用于减少皮肤病变分类中的肤色偏见，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤病变分类中取得了显著进展，但肤色偏见可能影响诊断公平性，需要解决。

Method: 通过计算VGG网络和Vision Transformer的特征图偏度，减少与肤色相关的通道，专注于病变区域。

Result: 算法降低了计算成本，减少了偏见，并可能缩小模型规模，同时保持公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法为皮肤病变分类提供了一种更公平且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野（ERF）和输入归因方法，更准确地解释视觉稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的因果驱动因素，避免仅依赖激活位置的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过最高激活的patch解释SAE特征，但自注意力机制导致激活patch可能只是伴随而非因果驱动因素。

Method: 提出CaFE方法，利用ERF和输入归因方法识别因果驱动patch。

Result: CaFE揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖（如“咆哮的脸”需要眼睛和鼻子共同出现），并通过patch插入测试验证其有效性。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的特征解释，凸显仅依赖激活位置的潜在风险。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言检索方法在处理抽象事件、隐含因果关系或复杂叙述时表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用多阶段检索框架，结合Qwen3、Qwen3-Reranker和Qwen2-VL等技术，并使用RRF融合多配置输出。

Result: 在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge的Track 2私有测试集上取得了top-1成绩。

Conclusion: 结合语言推理和多模态检索的方法在复杂图像理解任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Conclusion: 该框架在低资源临床环境中表现出色，通过消融实验验证了各组件对多模态医学理解的贡献。

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical

Conclusion: GaussianBridge为3DGS模型提供了一种高效、通用且鲁棒的版权保护方法。

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined

efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

Motivation: 发现HOI检测中相似三元组互相干扰的问题，影响模型学习。

Method: 提出'contrastive-then-calibration'和'merge-then-split'两种去偏学习目标。

Result: 在HICO-Det上比基线提升9.18% mAP，比SOTA提升3.59% mAP。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决偏见问题，显著提升HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Result: InterPose包含73.8K个3D人类动作序列及文本描述，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: InterPose为复杂人-物交互动作生成提供了高质量数据，并支持零样本动画生成。

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法在效果、效率和安全性之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全人脸检索提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Conclusion: 该框架能够动态对齐视觉特征与脑信号表征，生成更生物可信的脑信号。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景理解，忽略了真实驾驶场景中的时间维度，限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 提出OmniReason-Data数据集和OmniReason-Agent架构，前者通过自动标注管道生成时空密集标注，后者结合稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中表现优异，提升了时空推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架为复杂动态环境中的自动驾驶提供了可解释且时间感知的新能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在需要外部知识的视觉问答中性能受限的问题，传统单次检索框架知识不足。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升检索召回率和答案准确率。

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型VQA提供了一种可扩展的组合推理方法。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集上表现优于现有方法，PSNR平均提升3.09 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Motivation: 胎儿超声图像存在低组织对比度、边界模糊和操作依赖性等问题，需要一种方法来提升分类可靠性。

Method: 设计了一个浅层纹理敏感网络，预测临床合理的对比度参数，生成多视图增强图像并融合到下游分类器中。

Conclusion: ACAM通过内容感知和物理信息转换，提升了医学图像分析的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

*Xinlei Liu,Tao Hu,Peng Yi,Weitao Han,Jichao Xie,Baolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度的高效对抗攻击方法SDM，通过重构优化目标和三阶段框架提升攻击性能和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性需要高效的对抗攻击方法。

Method: 重构优化目标为最大化非真实标签概率上界与真实标签概率的差异，提出三阶段框架（循环-阶段-步骤）和DPDR损失函数。

Result: SDM在攻击性能和成本效益上优于现有方法，并能结合对抗训练提升防御效果。

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效且通用的对抗攻击方法，适用于模型鲁棒性评估和防御增强。

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Gabor滤波器和模糊U-Net-ViT模型的新方法，用于提高纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复杂纹理和噪声环境下表现不佳，需要一种结合局部和全局特征的方法来提升检测效果。

Method: 结合U-Net的局部特征训练和ViT的全局处理，使用高斯滤波损失函数去除背景噪声，SP掩码强化边界，Gabor滤波后处理优化缺陷特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上平均AUC达到0.939，参数优化和消融实验验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂纹理和噪声环境下表现出色，为表面缺陷检测提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

*Zhijing Wu,Longguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一优化框架，通过将相机姿态作为可学习参数与3D高斯属性结合，实现端到端优化，显著提升了动态3D场景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景重建中因运动模糊导致相机姿态估计错误，进而影响重建效果。

Method: 将相机和物体运动建模为3D高斯的SE(3)仿射变换，并采用三阶段训练策略交替优化相机姿态和高斯属性。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实场景序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和姿态估计精度上优于现有动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一优化框架和三阶段训练策略，有效解决了动态场景重建中的运动模糊问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

TL;DR: SegDINO是一个高效的分割框架，结合了冻结的DINOv3主干和轻量级解码器，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的解码器或多尺度融合，导致参数和计算成本高，SegDINO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用冻结的DINOv3主干提取多级特征，对齐分辨率和通道宽度，并用轻量级MLP头预测分割掩码。

Result: 在六个基准测试中（包括医学和自然图像数据集），SegDINO均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SegDINO在保持基础特征表示能力的同时，最小化了可训练参数，是一种高效的分割框架。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合Swin Transformer和U-Net的混合去雾框架SUFERNOBWA，用于提升卫星图像的清晰度和信息提取准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气干扰和雾霾降低了卫星图像的清晰度，影响了信息提取的准确性。

Method: 采用SwinRRDB模块结合全局和局部特征学习，并使用复合损失函数（L2损失、引导损失和新型分水岭损失）来增强结构边界保护。

Result: 在RICE和SateHaze1K数据集上表现优异，PSNR达33.24 dB，SSIM为0.967。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减轻了大气干扰，展示了在遥感应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

### [80] [Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843)
*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分解单视图NVS为360度场景外推和视图插值的方法，以解决现有方法在长距离或循环轨迹中视图一致性和对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成与输入显著偏离的视图时，难以保持长期视图和场景一致性，尤其是在长距离或循环轨迹中。

Method: 首先通过全景扩散模型学习场景先验，然后从全景图中采样并扭曲关键帧，再通过预训练的视频扩散模型生成新视图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成一致视图方面优于现有方法，尤其在循环闭合场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解和条件化关键帧，实现了全局一致的视图生成和灵活的相机控制。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQAT提出了一种面向平坦性的量化感知训练方法，解决了现有QAT方法在OOD数据上性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT方法主要关注I.D数据性能，忽视了OOD数据上的性能下降问题。

Method: FQAT通过层冻结机制和自适应冻结算法，优化梯度冲突和层间干扰。

Result: 实验表明FQAT在I.D和OOD任务上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FQAT通过平坦性优化，显著提升了量化模型的OOD泛化性能。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于姿态数据的脊柱侧弯筛查方法，通过双表征框架（DRF）结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量（PAV），解决了现有方法忽略临床相关不对称性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI筛查方法依赖轮廓数据集，忽略了临床相关的不对称性，而姿态数据虽直观但缺乏大规模标注数据集且对噪声敏感。

Method: 提出Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架（DRF），结合连续骨架图和PAV，并引入PAV引导注意力模块（PGA）。

Result: DRF在实验中表现优异，可视化显示模型能有效利用临床不对称线索。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双表征框架提升了脊柱侧弯筛查的准确性和临床解释性，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功表明提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关特征会引入噪声和计算成本。

Method: Spotlighter从样本和语义角度评估视觉令牌的激活，保留高分令牌，并通过语义记忆库优化选择。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在谐波平均准确率上提升11.19%，并增加0.8K FPS。

Conclusion: Spotlighter是一种高效且可扩展的提示调优基线方法。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

Motivation: 低光RAW视频去噪因高传感器增益和短曝光时间导致信号严重退化，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 提出条件方案利用捕获元数据指导对齐和去噪，并设计BOSS机制建模长程时间依赖。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最先进性能，为低光视频去噪设定了新标准。

Conclusion: DarkVRAI通过创新方法显著提升了低光视频去噪的效果。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩比的令牌压缩策略无法适应视频片段语义密度的变化，导致信息丰富片段表示不足或静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 利用轻量级语言模型生成软描述令牌，基于语义密度监督动态调整压缩比。

Result: FLOPs减少49%，性能保持竞争力，且能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比。

Conclusion: LangDC有效平衡了计算效率和视频理解性能，适用于动态视频内容。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但在多光谱数据上直接优化会导致重建效果不佳，因为几何结构在不同光谱下表现不一致。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1）独立优化各波段；2）先优化RGB几何结构再复制并优化其他波段；3）联合优化所有波段。

Result: 联合优化策略显著提升了多光谱重建效果，并通过光谱交叉增强RGB结果。

Conclusion: 建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色分量中，并揭示了优化过程中引入光谱波段的关键权衡。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Method: 通过两步聚类方法分析驾驶员在晴天和雨天条件下的眼动行为，包括聚类注视点、生成元聚类，并结合马尔可夫转移矩阵和注视持续时间等指标。

Result: 雨天条件下，驾驶员更频繁地查看仪表盘，注视持续时间更长，视线高度更高，表明认知负荷增加。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了雨天驾驶时的视觉注意力变化，为优化ADAS和DMS设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against

TL;DR: CompSlider提出了一种在文本到图像生成中同时控制多个属性的方法，通过解耦属性和结构损失实现精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每个属性单独训练适配器，忽略了属性间的纠缠，导致多属性控制时出现干扰。

Method: CompSlider通过生成条件先验和控制多个属性，引入解耦和结构损失来保持图像结构一致性。

Result: 方法在多种图像属性上表现良好，并可扩展到视频生成，同时减少了计算负担。

Conclusion: CompSlider实现了多属性的可靠独立控制，提升了文本到图像生成的精确性。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全合一模型，通过一次性测试时适应机制，恢复被多种污染物污染的玻璃图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖合成数据或仅针对雨滴，本文旨在解决现实中多种污染物（如泥水、灰尘等）导致的图像退化问题。

Method: 使用真实配对图像训练，结合自监督辅助学习任务，通过测试时适应机制调整模型以适应不同污染物类型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，尤其在处理未见过的污染物时表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效恢复被多种污染物污染的图像，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Result: 在昼夜过渡场景中，Recall@1相对提升57%，并在长距离驾驶数据集上验证了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在光照变化下表现优异，并提供了关键设计选择的分析，代码和基准框架将开源。

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Conclusion: LPFM为病理图像处理提供了高效统一的解决方案，显著提升了图像质量和任务适应性。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效且准确的方法，但CNN和Transformer分别存在感受野有限和计算成本高的问题。Mamba因其处理长序列的能力成为有潜力的替代方案。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块（HSFA）和视觉状态空间模块（VSSM），并引入Hilbert曲线扫描技术以增强空间相关性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba通过结合频率和空间特征，有效解决了医学图像检测中的全局上下文捕捉问题，为相关任务提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向稀疏注意力（BSA）框架，显著提升了视频DiT模型的训练和推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频DiT模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算瓶颈，尤其是高分辨率和长视频场景，全注意力的二次复杂度导致高昂的计算成本。

Method: BSA框架通过动态稀疏化查询（Query）和键值对（Key-Value）来优化3D全注意力，包括基于语义相似度的查询稀疏化和动态统计阈值的KV稀疏化。

Result: 实验表明，BSA将训练FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，且生成质量不降反升。

Conclusion: BSA是一种高效且有效的解决方案，适用于视频DiT模型的训练和推理。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上表现优于多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升300%。

Conclusion: VEPE框架简单灵活，有效结合时空上下文，显著提升了视频姿态估计的性能和效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Result: 在基准数据集上，PVINet表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互，显著提升了点云重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式（FICGen），用于解决在退化场景中布局到图像生成的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在退化场景（如低光、水下）中，布局到图像生成存在生成保真度低和与用户提供布局对齐弱的问题，主要归因于上下文幻觉困境。

Method: FICGen通过双查询机制提取频率原型，并结合视觉频率增强注意力注入频率知识，同时使用实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块来解耦上下文。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率知识转移和上下文解耦，显著提升了退化场景中的布局到图像生成效果。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同形状和纹理的区域，限制了特征表示的效果。

Method: 使用熵驱动算法将图像划分为纹理均匀的区域，每个区域参数化为2D高斯（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征，通过专用Transformer优化高斯参数。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

TL;DR: MetaSSL提出了一种基于空间异质性损失的半监督学习框架，通过同时利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，为不同像素分配不同权重，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Motivation: 现有的半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，而忽略了标记数据中的潜在噪声以及不同未标记像素的异质性价值。MetaSSL旨在通过挖掘损失函数中两个预测的丰富信息，提升半监督学习的效果。

Method: MetaSSL通过将未标记数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），并为每个区域分配递减的权重，设计了一种空间异质性损失。此外，还提出了自适应阈值来区分自信和可疑预测，并将异质性损失应用于标记图像以应对潜在的标注噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，MetaSSL与现有半监督学习框架结合后，在不同数据集上显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一种即插即用的通用框架，能够有效提升半监督学习在医学图像分割中的性能，尤其适用于存在标注噪声的场景。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过多时间戳信息提升了行人跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 发现这些编码器在识别关键帧方面能力有限，影响模型对文本查询的处理。

Conclusion: 需开发更优的关键帧识别技术以提升视频多模态大语言模型的效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决动态一致性和复杂语义上下文方面不足，主要受限于EEG的低空间分辨率、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足。

Method: DynaMind包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器（RSM）、时间感知动态对齐器（TDA）和双引导视频重建器（DGVR），分别处理语义特征提取、时间一致性建模和视频重建。

Conclusion: DynaMind在神经动态与高保真视觉语义之间架起桥梁，标志着重要技术进步。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by

pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多主体个性化图像生成中主体保真度和属性泄漏的挑战。

Method: 基于动态语义对应和图像复杂度调整焦点区域，采用加权策略优化信息丰富的区域。

Result: 在单主体和多主体个性化图像合成基准上取得最优结果，有效减少属性泄漏。

Conclusion: FocusDPO在多主体可控图像合成领域取得显著进展。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏地面真实数据的无监督环境下，现有的深度学习分割质量评估方法存在评估粒度粗、不完整和可迁移性差的问题。

Method: 提出SegAssess框架，将SQA任务转化为细粒度的四类全景分割任务，利用改进的SAM架构和交叉注意力机制，结合边缘引导压缩分支和增强混合采样训练策略。

Result: 在32个数据集上的实验表明，SegAssess实现了最先进的性能，并展示了出色的零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM为无监督SQA提供了鲁棒且可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Method: 提出编码器-解码器框架，利用多时相多光谱影像和时间差异预测树高。

Result: U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上表现最佳，误差比ResNet-50低12%，比仅用RGB波段低30%。

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集和代码已公开，为森林监测提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

Motivation: 解决多3D形状间点对点对应关系的问题，现有方法通常从单一形状学习嵌入，缺乏对整体形状集合的考虑。

Method: 利用形状图注意力网络捕捉形状集合的流形结构，构建共享潜在空间，并通过空间和谱域表示对应关系，使用循环一致性损失对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DcMatch表现优于现有方法，实现了更准确和一致的形状匹配。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过共享潜在空间和双重一致性损失，显著提升了多形状匹配的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Conclusion: 新指标和数据生成方法有效提升了开放词汇SGG的性能和评估效率。

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Conclusion: PRINTER为计算病理学提供了稳健且可扩展的虚拟染色解决方案。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Result: 训练出的POINTS-Reader模型在性能和数据集质量上均优于现有公开和专有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过合成数据和自改进方法，显著提升了文档转换模型的性能和数据质量。

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Conclusion: FantasyHSI通过闭环反馈和多智能体协作，有效提升了人类-场景交互的长期逻辑一致性和物理真实性。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 双视图跨重建比单视图自重建更具挑战性，能显著提升点云自监督学习性能。

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Conclusion: ReCap有效结合视觉感知与现实世界知识，为高风险领域的上下文感知图像理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Motivation: 雷达传感器在恶劣天气和光照条件下比摄像头更稳定，但现有雷达目标检测方法效率不足。

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于常微分方程和傅里叶变换的一体化模块FSS-TIs，用于跨域少样本分割任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域少样本分割方法模块独立，知识流动受限，无法充分发挥潜力。

Method: 通过ODE关系假设和傅里叶变换，设计迭代变换过程，优化ODE参数以探索域无关特征空间。

Result: 实验证明FSS-TIs优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过一体化模块和严格约束，显著提升了跨域少样本分割的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化LiDAR超分辨率和语义分割的端到端框架，显著提升了低成本16通道LiDAR数据的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR成本高，限制了大规模部署；低成本16通道LiDAR数据稀疏，分割精度低。

Method: 采用联合优化的端到端框架，结合语义线索的超分辨率模块和新设计的SR损失函数。

Result: 分割性能接近高分辨率64通道LiDAR数据，且模型轻量、参数少。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低成本LiDAR数据分割精度低的问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中的模糊性需要模型捕捉完整的条件分布，而非单点估计。

Method: PGRD将离散标签嵌入连续空间，利用粗粒度先验预测器提供逐步指导，扩散网络学习残差以加速收敛。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD在Dice分数和NLL/ECE值上优于基线方法，且采样步骤更少。

Conclusion: PGRD通过先验指导和深度扩散监督，实现了高效且校准良好的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，准确率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为GeoAI提供了一种无需从头训练的可扩展解决方案，展示了检索增强生成技术的潜力。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Motivation: 解决传统土壤分析方法速度慢、劳动密集的问题，满足精准农业的实时决策需求。

Method: 结合ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0、Vision Transformer进行土壤分类，使用MLP、XGBoost、LightGBM、TabNet分析土壤数据。

Result: 模型准确率98%，RMSE和MAE分别为0.32和0.27，多模态耦合效果显著。

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的实时决策支持方案。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法因模态特定设计而缺乏统一性和可扩展性，阻碍了跨模态表示学习的发展。

Method: 利用包含2D、3D和视频数据的混合模态数据集，结合生成式（MAE）和对比式（SimDINO）自监督学习训练M3Ret。

Result: M3Ret在零样本检索中超越基线模型，并展示了跨模态对齐和泛化能力，即使未训练过MRI数据。

Conclusion: M3Ret为多模态医学图像理解的自监督基础模型提供了可行方向。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Motivation: 解决数据稀缺和高调优成本问题，提升身份保持文本到视频生成的质量。

Method: 提出Face Aware Prompt Enhancement、Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement和ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement三种技术。

Result: 在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中取得第一名，验证了方法的优越性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TPIGE框架在身份保持和视频质量上表现优异，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement

Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RAL框架通过概率建模和动态加权相似性，解决了PRVR中的不确定性挑战。

Motivation: PRVR中存在查询歧义和视频部分相关性问题，导致现有方法易受干扰视频影响。

Result: 实验表明RAL能有效提升多种检索架构的性能。

Conclusion: RAL为PRVR提供了一种鲁棒的对齐学习解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决体素网格在医学影像中的分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 隐式场景表示在几何操作中优于基于体素的表示，代码将在发表后公开。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注生成内容的语义控制，忽视了风格一致性的重要性。

Result: 实验证明NSD在语义对齐和风格一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: NSD为图像编辑提供了有效的解决方案，并建立了标准化评估基准。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Result: 实验证明InfoScale在可变尺度图像生成中表现优异，且具有即插即用的特性。

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息优化解决了扩散模型在跨分辨率生成中的核心问题，为可变尺度图像生成提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Motivation: 现有方法中，CNN效率高但感受野有限，ViT能建模全局上下文但计算成本高。

Method: 在分层卷积主干中集成轻量级SSM门控机制，动态调制特征图并选择性强调关键特征。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，PC为0.9187，MAE为0.2022，RMSE为0.2610，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 验证了CNN与选择性SSM结合的潜力，为视觉理解任务提供了新架构范式。

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Conclusion: 数据集和模型为足球视频摘要任务提供了基准，新指标提升评估客观性。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体素方法推理速度慢和柱状方法精度不足的问题。

Method: 将3D点云水平切片为2D数据，并设计Slice Interaction Network保持垂直关系。

Result: 在Waymo、nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上均表现出色，速度和参数效率显著提升。

Conclusion: PointSlice在速度和精度之间取得了良好平衡，适用于自动驾驶中的3D物体检测。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at
https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试中，ConTiCoM-3D在质量和效率上均优于现有扩散和潜在一致性模型。

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D是一个可扩展的3D形状生成实用框架。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: nnUNet框架虽能自动调整大部分超参数，但忽略了网络内部超参数的优化，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过自适应性卷积模块动态调整卷积核大小，集成到MSA2-Net的多尺度卷积桥和多尺度融合解码器中，优化特征提取和解码过程。

Result: MSA2-Net在多个数据集上表现优异，Dice系数分别为86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%。

Conclusion: MSA2-Net在医学图像分割任务中展现出强大的鲁棒性和精确性。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Result: 在图像和视频任务中分别保持94.0%和98.6%的原始性能，同时减少生成延迟31.5%和74.2%。

Conclusion: V$^2$Drop是一种高效且兼容性强的令牌压缩方法，适用于大型视觉语言模型加速。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Conclusion: Uniferum通过整合异质注释和身体分割，为3D医学影像提供了数据高效且临床可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Result: 在体外实验中，SSIM和PSNR分别达0.796和23.780，处理速度15帧/秒。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能实时去噪，显著提升HIFU治疗的临床监测精度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一种无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，通过轻量级对称双视图关联模型（STA）作为前端，显著降低复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统SLAM系统依赖相机内参的问题，使其适用于多样化相机配置。

Method: 前端使用STA模型估计相机位姿并回归局部点图，后端构建Sim(3)位姿图结合闭环检测消除漂移。

Result: 在相机跟踪和稠密3D重建质量上优于现有方法，前端模型大小仅为同类方法的35%。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM在无需相机内参的情况下实现了高效且高质量的SLAM性能。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit提出了一种统一的视频编辑框架，通过对象失真控制信号和保留模块实现高效、高保真的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频编辑方法需要针对不同任务设计不同的控制信号，增加了模型复杂性和训练资源需求。

Method: 提出基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号（O-DisCo），并结合“复制形式”保留模块。

Result: 实验和人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在多种视频编辑任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit通过统一框架解决了多样化视频编辑的挑战，提升了编辑效率和效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Panel-of-Peers的新框架，通过模拟同行评审系统，利用多个LVLMs相互评估和学习，减少对人工标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，机器生成的数据质量有限，自监督数据易产生幻觉。

Method: 采用Panel-of-Peers框架，多个LVLMs通过迭代自我改进过程相互评估和学习，模拟课堂学习环境。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，平均分数从48%提高到57%。

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers是一种可扩展的替代方案，能够有效提升模型性能，减少对人工标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型的调度器而非权重，实现了模型大小减少4倍的同时保持全精度准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型计算成本高，后训练量化方法依赖全精度校准，限制了其应用。

Method: Q-Sched通过修改调度器的采样轨迹，结合JAQ损失（结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标）进行优化。

Result: Q-Sched在4步和8步模型上分别实现了15.5%和16.6%的FID提升，用户研究也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Q-Sched证明了量化和少步蒸馏在高保真生成中的互补性，为高效扩散模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

*Yanqing Liu,Xianhang Li,Letian Zhang,Zirui Wang,Zeyu Zheng,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了架构和损失设计，提升了训练效率，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过简化架构（移除文本编码器和对比损失）来提升训练效率。

Method: 仅保留生成式训练信号（captioning loss），移除文本编码器和对比损失。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍，内存消耗降低1.8倍，性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级生成式范式对未来多模态基础模型开发具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Result: 在多个感知密集型基准测试中达到SOTA性能，如CV-Bench上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: ReVPT为基于RL的视觉工具使用提供了新见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Conclusion: 为自监督预训练和其他降维方法的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 岩石尺寸的精确分类对工程效率和安全性至关重要，现有方法在捕捉岩石图像的细粒度局部模式和全局上下文关系方面存在不足。

Method: 在ConvNeXt基础上引入自注意力和通道注意力机制，分别捕获长距离空间依赖性和突出信息丰富的特征通道。

Result: 在岩石尺寸分类数据集上验证，模型性能优于三个基线，注意力机制显著提升了细粒度分类能力。

Conclusion: CNSCA模型通过结合注意力机制，有效提升了岩石尺寸分类的精度和鲁棒性，适用于自然纹理的细粒度分类任务。

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床元数据的两阶段扩散框架，用于解决有限角度CT重建中的伪影问题，显著提高了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT在心脏成像中具有时间分辨率高和辐射剂量低的优势，但投影截断导致严重伪影，需要解决其不适定性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段基于元数据生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段结合先验和元数据生成高保真图像，并通过ADMM模块确保物理一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，该方法在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上优于现有基线，尤其在严重角度截断下表现突出。

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，支持将其整合到未来的医学成像框架中。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Conclusion: TransMatch为增材制造缺陷检测提供实用、可扩展的解决方案，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉识别数据通常是长尾分布的，这给深度神经网络的训练和部署带来挑战。信息瓶颈（IB）是一种有效的表示学习方法，但需要改进以适应长尾数据。

Method: 提出BIB方法，将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术集成到原始IB网络中。进一步提出MBIB结构，结合不同网络层的知识。

Conclusion: BIB和MBIB方法在长尾视觉识别任务中表现出色，为表示学习和分类提供了新的信息理论视角。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Motivation: 图像光照控制是一个复杂任务，现有方法依赖大量特定领域数据，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用自注意力层中的光照关系，训练LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，并通过Classifier Guidance将光照融入生成过程。

Result: 在多种场景类型中展示了最先进的性能，具有参数和数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过利用基础知识，PractiLight实现了实用且通用的光照控制。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Method: LGDiST利用上下文基因构建生物意义的潜在空间，通过扩散模型完成基因表达预测。

Result: LGDiST在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，并在6种方法中提升预测性能达10%。

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构显著优于其单独组件，证明了其创新性和有效性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Conclusion: 研究为联邦学习在自动驾驶车辆中的实际应用提供了系统级评估方法，强调了环境鲁棒性和资源效率的重要性。

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Motivation: 传统方法耗时且现代计算机视觉方法需要大量标注数据，限制了灾后快速部署。本研究旨在开发无需监督训练的灵活、可解释的工作流程。

Method: 提出了两种流程：纯VLM（Pipeline A）和VLM+LLM（Pipeline B），基于特定野火损害指标的结构化提示进行分类。

Result: 多视角分析显著提升了分类效果（F1分数从0.225-0.511提升至0.857-0.947），但Pipeline A和B的改进无统计学显著性差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为灾后响应提供了无需训练的快速部署方案，未来可探索LLM提示在损害评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets

Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,

Method: 引入概念感知对齐模块，将图像和位置嵌入投影到共享地理概念库，并最小化概念级损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定位准确性和地理预测任务中优于GeoCLIP，并提供更丰富的语义解释。

Conclusion: 首次将可解释性引入地理定位，为地理决策过程提供了更深入的语义理解。

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Result: 在流程图数据集上验证，图像-文本匹配和视觉问答任务表现显著优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: 定制化训练策略对专业任务至关重要，推动了视觉-语言集成中图表理解的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出色，定量指标和感知质量均具竞争力。

Conclusion: 为高斯泼溅在2D图像处理中的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Result: MOSAIC在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，支持4+主体生成。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为复杂多主体合成应用提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Result: 实验表明VARIN能根据提示有效修改图像，同时保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN是一种实用的图像编辑方法，验证了VAR模型在编辑任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在图像编辑中存在责任分配不平衡问题，理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需同时承担设计和绘制任务。

Method: 引入DIM数据集（包含DIM-T2I和DIM-Edit子集），并通过轻量级MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，训练得到DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit模型。

Conclusion: 明确将设计责任分配给理解模块对图像编辑有显著益处，且小规模模型也能实现高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous

explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter实现了稳定且语义一致的图像生成，适用于广泛的调色板和提示。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型（如MobileNet）是资源受限环境中可扩展、低成本NICU监测系统的最可行方案。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of
vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard
negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple
yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned
representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT)系统的安全性问题，提出了VEIL对抗框架，揭示了其在设计和逻辑上的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RMOT在语言-视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其可靠性和安全性尚未充分研究，尤其是在对抗攻击下的表现。

Method: 通过设计VEIL对抗框架，针对RMOT的时空推理和匹配机制进行攻击，揭示了其潜在漏洞。

Result: 实验表明，VEIL能有效破坏RMOT的跟踪逻辑，导致ID切换和终止，验证了其攻击效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了RMOT系统在关键应用中需要更安全的设计，以应对对抗攻击的威胁。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Motivation: 现有对比自监督学习依赖大量真实数据和精心设计的负样本，研究探索替代方案，利用合成数据增强多样性和挑战性。

Result: 在DeiT-S和Swin-T架构上验证了合成数据增强训练的潜力与局限性。

Conclusion: 合成数据在自监督学习中具有前景，但需进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的slot attention方法，通过ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch解决现有方法缺乏高级语义信息和无法微调编码器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有slot attention方法基于低层次特征分配图像区域，缺乏对语义信息的理解，且编码器无法灵活微调。

Method: 引入ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景语义信息，以及Bootstrap Branch解耦特征适应与重建阶段。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种SOTA slot attention模型的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了现有slot attention的局限性，提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于训练数据集中某些属性的代表性不足，导致识别性能受限。

Method: 通过定义协议识别弱识别属性，利用扩散模型生成合成行人图像，并设计策略将合成数据融入训练。

Result: 在流行PAR数据集上，该方法不仅提升了对代表性不足属性的识别，还提高了整体模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需改变模型架构即可增强零样本泛化能力，为提升真实场景中的行人属性识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的逻辑异常检测方法，通过建模对象组成图的分布，显著提升了逻辑异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的组件）时表现不佳，主要依赖于预训练特征或手工描述符，忽略了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，引入新的组成分支建模对象组成图分布，并提出无需手工标签的组成图提取方法。

Result: 在MVTec LOCO基准测试中，SALAD达到96.1%的图像级AUROC，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SALAD通过语义感知和组成图建模，有效解决了逻辑异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

TL;DR: NOOUGAT是一种新型多目标跟踪器，通过统一的GNN框架和ALT层实现任意时间范围的跟踪，解决了在线和离线跟踪的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线和离线多目标跟踪方法各自存在局限性，无法满足实际部署中对灵活时间范围的需求。

Method: 采用统一的GNN框架处理非重叠子片段，并通过ALT层融合，实现灵活的时间范围控制。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，在线模式下AssA提升显著，离线模式下效果更佳。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT首次实现了任意时间范围的多目标跟踪，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在360°图像中忽略跨帧相关全景的问题，提升全景场景理解能力。

Method: 提出CFpano数据集，并基于此开发了结合GRPO优化的多模态大语言模型。

Result: 模型在多项VQA任务中表现最佳，整体性能提升5.37%。

Conclusion: GRPO和CFpano为全景场景理解提供了新基准，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Conclusion: ITD数据集和对抗性内存初始化策略为TTA研究提供了更真实的评估和改进方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，例如在ShanghaiTech Part A和Part B上MAE分别为48.9和5.9。

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过挖掘特征相关性，有效提升了复杂场景下的人群计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Motivation: 解决非结构化城市场景因复杂多样布局带来的理解和泛化挑战。

Result: 在IDD数据集上达到50% mIoU，优于单源方法。

Conclusion: SynthGenNet有效提升跨域预测一致性，减少对目标数据标注的依赖。

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过手工设计的损失函数优化空间关系，效果不佳，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 提出Learn-to-Steer框架，利用轻量级分类器从交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，作为学习损失函数。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev和SD2.1基准上，空间准确性分别从0.20提升到0.61和0.07提升到0.54。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何理解的双重反转策略，显著提升了多关系下的空间准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有代理研究多集中于GUI或实体场景，但复杂任务需两者交互，数据冲突导致性能下降。

Method: 提出分层异构MoE，分离深层参数消除冲突，共享浅层参数利用协同效应，并统一动作空间。

Result: OmniActor在GUI和实体任务中均优于单一数据训练的代理，尤其在GUI任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: OmniActor通过结构和数据设计成功解决冲突并利用协同效应，成为高性能通用代理。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 序数图像分类中标签噪声问题严重，影响模型性能，需有效校正方法。

Method: 利用标签分布学习（LDL）建模序数标签的模糊性，动态调整标签分布的均值和标准差。

Result: 在Adience和Diabetic Retinopathy数据集上，ORDAC及其变体显著降低误差并提高召回率。

Conclusion: 自适应标签校正策略能增强序数分类模型在噪声数据下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Conclusion: C33D方法在生成结构一致的3D模型方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对MLLMs空间理解能力的全面评估，且局限于孤立场景（如单视图或视频）。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过MulSeT基准测试，分析了单视图、多视图和视频三种场景下的空间推理能力，并从数据和架构角度进行了实验。

Result: 数据方面，空间理解的性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，但上限较低；架构方面，空间理解更依赖视觉编码器中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以提升性能，未来需通过数据扩展和架构优化来改进MLLMs的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Motivation: 医学图像分割在诊断和治疗中至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的通用性。基础模型虽强大，但在医学图像中表现不佳。

Method: 设计了多尺度标记聚合的ViT架构，并在CT-3M数据集上进行领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征。

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中达到或超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedDINOv3展示了基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Conclusion: 研究打破了使用3D卷积处理4D成本体积的经验设计，为解耦聚合范式提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

Motivation: 医学图像分割依赖高质量标注，但标注成本高且存在噪声，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出GSD-Net，结合几何距离感知模块和结构引导标签细化模块，动态调整权重并优化标注。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上表现优异，噪声标注下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GSD-Net有效提升噪声标注下的分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes

Motivation: 改进现有文本到3D头像生成模型的效率与效果，避免缓慢的迭代优化。

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models.Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation.Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over previous
text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的位置编码方法AFPE，针对医学图像的各向异性问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高维和各向异性特性使得传统位置编码方法（如SPE和IFPE）效果不佳，需要一种更适应这些特性的编码方法。

Method: 提出了Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE)，结合了各向异性、类别和领域特定的空间依赖性。

Result: AFPE在多项任务中显著优于现有方法，特别是在各向异性数据中表现突出。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，选择适应数据各向异性和目标形状的位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型计算量大，难以在资源受限环境中实时应用。

Method: 集成预训练的2D CNN（如ResNet50、EfficientNet、ViT）与LSTM网络，并加入空间注意力机制。

Result: 在UCF101数据集子集上达到93.34%的准确率，优于现有HAR系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为健身动作识别提供了可扩展且实时的解决方案，适用于健康监测领域。

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法在非集中式混合模态医疗场景中不适用，需解决客户端模态和数据异质性。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: MDM-MixMFL框架在混合模态联邦学习中表现出色，解决了异质性问题。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR是一种无监督多目标发现方法，通过运动分割和自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR生成高质量伪标签，无需人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖监督生成伪标签训练对象中心学习模型，MR-DINOSAUR旨在解决这一限制，实现完全无监督的多目标发现。

Method: 利用无相机运动的视频帧进行运动分割，生成伪标签，并改进DINOSAUR的槽表示，训练槽停用模块区分前景和背景。

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR通过简单设计实现了高效的无监督多目标发现。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: token合并是提升3D视觉系统可扩展性的有效方法，FastVGGT为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神病患者因缺乏明显症状常被误诊，紧急情况下识别其问题尤为关键。

Method: 收集德国救援站的精神急诊患者数据，使用多种机器学习模型（包括Llama 3.1）进行预测分析。

Result: 模型展示了识别不健康精神障碍患者的潜力，尤其在救援场景中。

Conclusion: 机器学习和LLM可作为辅助工具，提升精神病患者的诊断效率。

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据湖和联邦学习提供了一种实用的数据泄露防御方案，并讨论了自适应攻击的挑战与未来方向。

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Motivation: 解决低比特后训练量化（PTQ）的精度下降问题，以及量化感知训练（QAT）因依赖反向传播而导致的高成本问题。

Method: 提出ZeroQAT框架，利用前向梯度估计替代反向传播，联合学习量化权重、权重裁剪阈值和等效变换。

Result: 实验表明ZeroQAT在保持QAT精度的同时，实现了PTQ的效率。

Conclusion: ZeroQAT为高质量低比特量化提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该方法通过迁移学习和传感器数据整合，有效解决了先进节点V_min预测的难题。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但计算成本高，现有加速方法受限于采样轨迹效率。

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架，将采样轨迹重新参数化为流匹配形式，并引入自适应速度分解。

Result: 在极低NFE（如5次）下，A-FloPS显著降低FID，生成更清晰、连贯的图像。

Conclusion: A-FloPS是一种高效、通用的高质量生成建模解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Conclusion: 权重分布的幂律特性对LoRA训练有显著影响，优化初始权重可有效提升训练效果。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

Conclusion: 当前脑启发方法存在局限性，未来需平衡记忆稳定性和学习可塑性。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习方法分析俄罗斯卫星异常活动，以预测军事冲突迹象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究俄罗斯卫星在乌克兰入侵前的异常活动，以发现未来冲突的预警信号。

Method: 采用多种深度学习方法（IF、AE、VAE、KAN、Anchor AE）分析公开的TLE数据，建立基线并检测异常。

Result: 发现俄罗斯卫星活动的统计显著异常，并细化到单个轨道元素的异常。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法能有效检测卫星异常行为，为军事预警提供支持。

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

Motivation: 光网络中故障管理的类别不平衡问题严重，后处理方法研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验数据集比较预处理、处理中和后处理方法在故障检测和识别中的效果。

Result: 后处理方法（如阈值调整）在故障检测中F1分数提升最高（15.3%），生成式AI在故障识别中性能提升最大（24.2%）。

Conclusion: 不同方法在不同场景下各有优势，后处理方法在故障检测中表现突出，生成式AI在故障识别中效果最佳。

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Motivation: 传统MLP缺乏对多尺度信号（如LoD）的原生支持，限制了其在信号表示任务中的应用。

Method: 在MLP隐藏层附加多个输出分支（T-MLP），通过直接监督实现多尺度学习。

Result: T-MLP在多种信号表示任务中表现优于其他神经LoD基线。

Conclusion: T-MLP为多尺度信号表示提供了一种高效解决方案，扩展了MLP的应用范围。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools
across domains, including cybersecurity, where they help detect threats early
and improve response times. However, challenges such as false positives and
complex model management still limit trust. Although Explainable AI (XAI) aims

combined with natural language reports based on attention outputs. This reduces
manual effort and speeds up remediation. Our comparative analysis showed that
RoBERTa offers high accuracy (99.6 %) and strong anomaly detection,
outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa, as well as exhibiting better flexibility
than large-scale Mistral-7B on the HDFS dataset from LogHub. User feedback

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language

landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Result: AI/ML能区分正常、异常和网络安全事件，但复杂事件分类仍需改进。

Conclusion: AI/ML在核网络安全中潜力显著，但需进一步优化复杂事件处理和多类架构。

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的问题，可能导致数据泄漏或基准性能虚高。

Method: 提出Generative Data Cartography框架，为预训练样本分配难度和记忆分数，并分区指导剪枝和权重调整。

Result: 实验显示，GenDataCarto在仅剪枝10%数据时，将合成数据提取成功率降低40%以上，验证困惑度仅增加0.5%。

Conclusion: 通过数据干预可显著减少泄漏，且对生成性能影响极小。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票依赖于候选响应的质量，无法在所有候选均错误时生成正确解决方案，且引入额外模型会增加部署成本。

Method: GSR框架通过统一模型并行生成候选响应并进行自我精炼，设计混合训练管道联合优化直接解决问题和精炼候选响应。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能，且自我精炼技能具有模型无关性，适用于不同规模模型和分布外推理任务。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效提升了LLM的推理能力，且具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 解决隐私法规（如巴西LGPD）限制敏感学生数据集中化的问题，探索隐私保护的计算方法。

Method: 采用联邦学习（FedProx算法）训练深度神经网络（DNN），模拟50所学校场景，并与集中式XGBoost模型对比。

Result: 联邦学习模型准确率达61.23%，仅比集中式模型（63.96%）略低，但提供了更强的隐私保障。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是巴西教育环境中构建协作预测模型的有效解决方案，符合LGPD要求。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

Result: 改进后的LSTM在文本分类任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化能有效提升LSTM性能。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Conclusion: CEAT通过协作学习显著提升集成模型的鲁棒性，具有灵活适用性。

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for

Conclusion: TPLO方法有效解决了剪枝对LLM谎言检测能力的负面影响，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Conclusion: LLM-QUBO框架降低了量子退火应用门槛，为大规模优化问题提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PMA的新方法，通过灵活组合Transformer模型各层的表示来提升ECG下游任务的性能。

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型内部表示的有效性，发现仅依赖最后一层表示并非最优。

Method: 使用1D ViT进行预训练，并在下游任务中通过门控网络选择性融合各层表示。

Result: PMA方法增强了表示能力，提升了下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: PMA方法通过有效利用模型各层表示，显著提升了ECG下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

TL;DR: LLM引导的优化（LLM-GO）在复杂化学参数空间中优于传统贝叶斯优化（BO），尤其在性能稀缺的高维空间中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）在化学实验优化中的潜力，以替代传统的黑盒参数搜索方法。

Method: 使用六个完全枚举的分类反应数据集，比较LLM-GO、贝叶斯优化（BO）和随机采样的性能。

Result: LLM-GO在五个单目标数据集中表现优于或与BO相当，尤其在参数复杂且高性能条件稀缺时优势显著。

Conclusion: LLM-GO在需要领域知识的复杂分类空间中表现卓越，为化学优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Motivation: 解决数据驱动建模中高计算成本和长期预测精度不足的问题。

Method: FNODE通过监督加速度而非积分状态，避免了传统Neural ODE的反向传播瓶颈，并采用FFT和FD混合数值微分技术。

Result: FNODE在多个基准测试中表现优于MBD-NODE、LSTM和FCNN，展现出高精度、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: FNODE是一种高效且准确的约束多体系统建模方法。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

Result: 在单块消费级GPU上，FlashTTS实现了2.2倍的高吞吐量和38%-68%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: FlashTTS为边缘设备提供了高性能的AI推理解决方案，推动了边缘AI的普及。

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自回归推理存在KV缓存线性增长和O(N^2 d)计算复杂度问题，限制了其处理超长序列的能力。

Method: 引入周期性状态更新机制，每k步执行一次全局信息同步，其余步骤保持常数时间计算。

Result: 理论和实验证明TConstFormer在速度、内存效率和长文本推理任务上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TConstFormer为高效、鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数估计方法在处理非线性、时空变化参数时表现不佳，尤其是在非线性动力学、多物理场交互或有限观测情况下。

Method: Neptune使用独立的坐标神经网络在物理空间或状态变量中连续表示每个参数场。

Result: Neptune在多个物理和生物医学问题中表现优异，仅需50个观测点即可实现稳健参数估计，误差比PINNs低两个数量级。

Conclusion: Neptune在工程、医疗等领域具有广泛的应用潜力，能够实现可靠且数据高效的参数推断。

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

Conclusion: Learn to Shard通过动态优化策略，显著提升了分布式LLM推理的性能。

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-

that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and

convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce

Conclusion: 变分量子门能有效解决长程预测的局限性，提供准确且鲁棒的多变量预测。

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

Conclusion: 分块策略首次实现TabPFN处理长上下文的能力，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型通常被解释为学习噪声数据的对数密度的梯度（即得分函数），但实际训练的网络并不强制满足保守向量场的条件。研究发现，训练后的扩散网络违反了得分函数的积分和微分约束，表明学习的向量场并非保守。尽管如此，模型在生成任务中表现优异。作者提出新理论视角：扩散训练应理解为对Wasserstein梯度流（WGF）速度场的流匹配，而非反向时间随机微分方程的得分学习。这一视角解释了为何即使神经向量场不是真实得分，生成采样仍能成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为扩散模型学习的是保守向量场（得分函数），但实际训练的网络架构并未强制满足这一条件。作者旨在解释为何非保守的神经向量场仍能有效生成高质量样本。

Method: 通过数值实验验证训练后的扩散网络违反得分函数的积分和微分约束，提出将扩散训练重新解释为对WGF速度场的流匹配，并分析非保守误差对密度传输的影响。

Result: 实验表明，尽管神经向量场非保守，扩散模型仍能成功生成样本。理论分析表明，非保守误差不一定会损害密度传输。

Conclusion: 作者主张采用WGF视角作为理解扩散生成模型的更原则性、优雅且理论基础坚实的框架，解释了模型成功的原因并简化了理论解释。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Conclusion: LLMDPD有效提升离线强化学习的泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Result: 数值实验验证PERL在自动驾驶轨迹预测中优于纯神经网络，数据需求更低。

Conclusion: PERL提升预测性能并减少数据需求，适用于实际自动驾驶应用。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度ReLU网络的训练对权重初始化敏感，现有方法无法有效控制预激活均值和稀疏性，导致神经元失活和梯度问题。

Method: 通过Stiefel流形上的优化问题设计正交初始化，保留尺度并校准预激活统计量，提供闭式解和高效采样方案。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法能防止神经元失活、减缓激活方差衰减并缓解梯度消失，实验验证其在多种数据集和场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 优化正交初始化显著提升深度ReLU网络的训练稳定性，适用于多种任务和激活函数。

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Result: 实验表明，PerturbEmbedding显著提升了GNN的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding为GNN提供了一种统一的对抗训练框架，有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Conclusion: CUFL通过课程学习和改进的聚合策略，有效解决了子图联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Conclusion: Metis为低比特量化下的LLM训练提供了稳定且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

Conclusion: 激活稀疏性在LLM中具有普遍性，研究结果为模型设计和优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

Conclusion: GAT框架不仅能提升预测性能，还能从实验数据中生成新的生物学假设。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Conclusion: SCFL攻击范式更符合现实攻击动机，FedThief实现了攻击者自私目标的双重效果。

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

*Lu Han,Mengyan Li,Jiping Qiang,Zhi Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASC方法通过整合金融和文本数据，优化权重参数和特征向量选择，显著提升了信用监控的聚类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构数据（数值金融变量和文本记录）对信用监控提出了挑战，需要一种有效的方法来整合和分析这些数据。

Method: 提出ASC方法，结合金融和文本相似性，通过优化权重参数和特征向量选择（基于特征值-轮廓优化）。

Result: 在1,428家中小企业数据集上，ASC的轮廓分数比基线方法高18%，并能识别出有意义的聚类（如低风险企业常包含“社会招聘”）。

Conclusion: ASC通过结合谱聚类理论和异构数据应用，支持更精准的信用干预，例如招聘导向的企业违约风险降低30%。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

*Lu Han,Xiuying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成多变量分割树（IMST）框架，结合财务和文本数据提升中小企业信用评估，准确率达88.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树模型在处理高维数据和文本信息时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 通过矩阵分解将文本数据转化为数值矩阵，用Lasso回归选择财务特征，基于基尼指数或熵构建多变量分割树，并应用最弱链接剪枝。

Result: 在1428家中国中小企业数据集上，IMST准确率88.9%，优于基线决策树（87.4%）和传统模型。

Conclusion: IMST在准确性、可解释性和计算效率上表现优越，架构更简洁，风险检测能力更强。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SA-DSD的知识蒸馏框架，将GNN的知识迁移到改进的FR-KAN+学生模型中，显著提升了性能并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘环境中，需要将GNN的知识迁移到更高效的模型（如MLP或KAN）中，但MLP在捕捉复杂邻域依赖关系时存在局限性。

Method: 改进FR-KAN为FR-KAN+，引入可学习频率基和相移机制，并设计基于师生预测一致性的采样概率矩阵和自适应加权损失机制。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，SA-DSD性能提升3.05%-3.62%（相比GNN教师模型）和15.61%（相比FR-KAN+），参数减少16.96倍，推理时间降低55.75%。

Conclusion: SA-DSF框架有效解决了GNN到KAN的知识迁移问题，显著提升了学生模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

TL;DR: TranCIT是一个开源的Python工具包，用于量化非平稳神经信号中的瞬态因果交互作用，填补了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理短暂的神经事件，且缺乏易用的Python实现。

Method: TranCIT整合了Granger因果性、传递熵以及更鲁棒的结构因果模型（DCS和rDCS）。

Result: 在高同步状态下成功捕捉因果性，并在真实数据中验证了海马CA3到CA1的瞬态信息流。

Conclusion: TranCIT为用户提供了一个易用且可靠的解决方案，用于研究复杂系统中的瞬态因果动态。

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ROFT-MOL方法，结合权重插值和集成微调技术，提升分子图基础模型在回归和分类任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子图基础模型（MGFMs）在微调时面临数据稀缺和任务多样性挑战，需要更鲁棒的微调方法。

Method: 将八种微调方法分为权重、表示和部分微调三类，并设计ROFT-MOL方法，结合权重插值和集成微调。

Result: ROFT-MOL在回归和分类任务中表现优异，同时保持了权重插值的易用性。

Conclusion: ROFT-MOL为分子图基础模型的微调提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is
LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and
supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the
large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art
probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a
practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic
forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Temporal Fusion Transformers的机器学习框架，用于预测电离层TEC，支持24小时预测，误差低至3.33 TECU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电离层变化对GNSS和卫星通信至关重要，但现有预测方法在强空间天气条件下准确性不足。

Method: 利用TFT模型结合太阳辐照度、地磁指数和GNSS数据，通过预处理和时间对齐策略进行预测。

Result: 模型在2010-2025年实验中表现优异，预测误差低，且太阳EUV辐照度是最强预测信号。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅预测准确，还通过注意力机制提供可解释性，并开源工具包ionopy以促进社区发展。

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

*Mengjie Zhao,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的分层控制微分方程（H-CDE）框架，用于从传感器数据中分离系统退化与操作动态，提高健康评估的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统退化通常难以直接观测，且传感器数据主要反映短期操作变化，导致退化推断困难。现有方法（如残差法）在动态系统中效果不佳，而NODEs框架存在数值刚性和退化分离问题。

Method: H-CDE框架包含慢（退化）和快（操作）两个CDE组件，采用多尺度时间积分方案、可学习路径变换和单调性激活函数，以解决数值刚性和退化分离问题。

Result: 在动态响应和稳态系统中，H-CDE优于残差基线方法，实现了更准确、鲁棒和可解释的退化推断。

Conclusion: H-CDE框架有效解决了退化与操作动态的分离问题，为系统健康监测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Motivation: 生成模型在文本到图像任务中表现出色，但依赖大规模训练数据可能导致无意复制受版权保护内容，引发法律和伦理问题。

Result: 实验证明AMCR能有效揭示和缓解潜在版权风险，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AMCR为生成模型的安全部署提供了实用方法和基准。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IPS方法在大动作空间或未充分探索上下文-动作空间时存在高方差问题，而现有的MIPS方法未能最小化均方误差或考虑上下文信息。

Method: 提出CAEL-MIPS，通过学习上下文-动作嵌入来最小化MIPS估计器的均方误差。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验表明，CAEL-MIPS在均方误差上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过优化上下文-动作嵌入，显著提升了MIPS估计器的性能。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

Result: 在多个问题上验证了方法的优越性，包括精度、噪声鲁棒性和不确定性量化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个方面优于现有算子学习方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Result: 在 PD-L1 和激酶抑制剂数据集上，VECTOR+ 生成的新分子在对接分数、新颖性和独特性上优于基准方法，部分分子表现优于已知药物。

Conclusion: VECTOR+ 是一种稳健且可扩展的方法，适用于低数据条件下的属性条件分子设计，结合对比学习和生成建模，加速 AI 驱动的药物发现。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DELTA的两阶段变分解耦生成学习框架，用于隐私保护数据重编程（PPDR），在提高目标属性预测准确性的同时减少敏感属性预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，数据常包含敏感属性且受严格法规约束，现有特征工程方法可能泄露隐私。

Method: DELTA框架分为两阶段：第一阶段使用强化学习生成高效用特征变换；第二阶段通过变分LSTM编码解码器和对抗因果解耦正则化消除隐私信号。

Result: 在八个数据集上，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，隐私泄露减少约35%。

Conclusion: DELTA是一种鲁棒的隐私感知数据转换方法。

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and

TL;DR: MAGN提出了一种可训练的神经模块，通过展开变分模态分解（UVMD）和模式特定带宽约束，显著提升了时空预测的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）在时空预测中存在频谱纠缠和计算效率低的问题，现有方法如VMGCN需要手动调参且计算成本高。

Method: MAGN将变分模态分解（VMD）转化为可训练的神经模块（UVMD），并引入模式特定的可学习带宽约束（αk），以自适应空间异质性。

Result: 在LargeST基准测试中，MAGN将分解时间减少了250倍，预测误差比VMGCN降低了85-95%，并优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MAGN通过可训练模块和自适应约束，显著提升了时空预测的效率和准确性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: BALD-GFlowNet是一种生成式主动学习框架，通过生成流网络直接采样，解决了传统池式主动学习在大规模未标记数据集上的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统池式主动学习方法（如BALD）在评估大规模未标记数据集时计算成本高，尤其在药物发现的虚拟筛选中问题更为突出。

Method: 提出BALD-GFlowNet，利用生成流网络（GFlowNets）直接按BALD奖励比例采样对象，替代传统的池式获取方法。

Result: 在虚拟筛选中，BALD-GFlowNet性能与标准BALD基线相当，同时生成结构更多样化的分子。

Conclusion: BALD-GFlowNet为高效、可扩展的分子发现提供了新方向。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

TL;DR: TAAM是一种无需重放数据、资源高效的持续图学习方法，通过动态调制冻结骨干网络的内部计算流来解决稳定性-可塑性困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法面临稳定性-可塑性困境和资源密集型预训练问题，TAAM旨在通过轻量级任务特定模块动态调制GNN推理过程。

Method: 提出任务感知自适应调制（TAAM），使用神经突触调制器（NSM）存储专家知识，并通过原型引导策略进行训练和推理。

Result: 在六个GCIL基准数据集上，TAAM全面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TAAM为持续图学习提供了一种高效且无需重放数据的新路径。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的基于Dempster-Shafer理论（DST）的属性融合分类器，通过选择性建模和新的BPA生成方法，提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DST分类器在复杂场景中因简化的隶属函数建模和BPA结构利用不足而效果受限。

Method: 采用选择性建模策略（单高斯和高斯混合模型）和新的BPA生成方法，并应用于证据K近邻分类器。

Result: 在基准数据集上，新分类器平均准确率提升4.84%，优于现有最佳证据分类器。

Conclusion: 改进的分类器在效果和鲁棒性上表现优越，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在异质图中表现不佳，因为依赖局部同质性邻居。研究边方向性和表达能力强的消息传递是否能提升分类性能。

Method: 提出两种模型：Poly（多项式表达的GAT基线）和Dir-Poly（方向感知变体，分别聚合入边和出边）。

Result: Poly在五个基准数据集上优于现有基线，Dir-Poly在具有方向性的图上表现更优，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 边方向和表达能力强的特征建模在异质图学习中具有互补作用，方向性消息传递的效果依赖于上下文。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProCause是一种新的生成方法，用于优化PresPM方法的评估，通过整合多种因果推断架构和考虑时间依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RealCause方法忽略了时间依赖性，且仅依赖单一模型架构，限制了其效果。

Method: ProCause支持序列和非序列模型，并整合了多种因果推断架构（S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型）。

Result: 实验表明，TARNet并非总是最佳选择，集成模型更可靠，LSTM在时间依赖性场景中表现更好。

Conclusion: ProCause通过更全面的模型架构和时间依赖性处理，提供了更可靠的PresPM方法评估。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 在COD-Cluster17基准测试中，SinkFast方法显著优于复杂的流匹配方法。

Conclusion: SinkFast为晶体结构预测提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Motivation: SHAP无法区分因果与相关性，导致高相关性特征重要性误判，影响模型解释的准确性。

Result: 实验验证Causal SHAP能减少对仅相关特征的误判，提升解释准确性。

Conclusion: Causal SHAP为可解释AI提供因果感知框架，特别适用于医疗等高风险领域。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Result: 分类准确率和ROCAUC均为0.908，表现出高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 机器学习在早期识别多样化学生才能方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of

focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this

effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and

Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次自注意力计算成本高，限制了其效率。

Method: 引入动态令牌路由（DTRNet），保留MLP模块，减少大部分令牌的注意力成本为线性。

Result: DTRNet在保持性能的同时，仅路由约10%的令牌通过注意力层，显著降低FLOPs。

Conclusion: DTRNet提供了一种高效、可扩展的Transformer替代方案，适用于长序列输入。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

Result: 发现宽度增加导致重叠相位模式，池化影响特征对齐，浅层模型可能陷入低秩嵌入。

Conclusion: 研究结果连接了表示几何与设计选择，为设计更可解释的GNN提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了其在长序列上的可扩展性，而现有线性模型可能因无法保留远距离令牌的详细信息而性能下降。

Method: SCOUT结合局部线性混合器（如Mamba或SWA）和稀疏注意力机制，仅对压缩后的历史令牌进行注意力计算。

Result: SCOUT在相同计算预算下优于基线模型，在语言建模和常识推理任务中与全注意力Transformer表现相当，同时具有更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT在性能和效率之间取得了平衡，适用于长序列任务。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

*Arjun Basandrai,Shourya Jain,K. Ilanthenral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应重采样训练方法（ART），通过动态调整类别分布提升不平衡分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重采样方法使用固定分布，忽略了类别学习难度的动态变化，限制了模型性能。

Method: ART基于类别的宏F1分数定期更新训练数据分布，动态调整重采样程度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ART显著优于传统重采样和算法级方法，平均提升宏F1 2.64个百分点。

Conclusion: ART是一种可靠的不平衡分类方法，性能稳定且显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

TL;DR: 提出一种在线去中心化联邦多任务学习算法，解决数据异构性和拜占庭客户端主导的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，联邦学习面临数据异构性和拜占庭客户端问题，现有方法无法应对拜占庭客户端占多数的情况。

Result: 仿真结果显示，算法在拜占庭客户端主导时表现接近无拜占庭环境。

Conclusion: 该算法为联邦学习在复杂现实场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

Motivation: 传统微调方法在动态适应多样数据分布时表现不足，MEPT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用专家混合架构，集成多个提示专家，自适应学习非平稳数据分布。

Result: 在SuperGLUE上优于现有基线，平均准确率提升1.94%，激活提示减少79.25%。

Conclusion: MEPT通过动态神经通路激活和理论支持，成为高效的数据分布适应框架。

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

TL;DR: FlexMDMs扩展了MDMs，支持可变长度序列生成，同时保留并行推理能力，在数学和代码填充任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs在非因果任务中表现良好，但不支持标记插入，限制了其生成固定长度序列的能力。

Method: 提出FlexMDMs，基于随机插值框架，通过插入和解除掩码标记生成可变长度序列。

Result: FlexMDMs在困惑度上与MDMs相当，长度建模更准确，数学和代码填充任务性能显著提升。

Conclusion: FlexMDMs成功解决了MDMs的局限性，展示了在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Result: 在DSADS和PAMAP2数据集上表现优于现有方法，无需用户校准即可实现高精度。

Conclusion: TPRL-DG为可扩展的人体活动识别系统提供了新思路，推动个性化医疗和智能环境的发展。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Conclusion: MatPROV为自动化合成规划和优化等未来研究提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

Motivation: 传统分布式轨迹优化方法需要大量调参，难以适应多样化任务和智能体配置。

Method: L2C通过轻量级神经网络元学习超参数，并利用ADMM-DDP管道进行分布式端到端训练。

Result: 在复杂任务中，L2C生成动态可行轨迹，适应性强，梯度计算速度提升88%。

Conclusion: L2C为多智能体协调提供了一种高效、自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 仅用少量训练数据（0.2346%基础模型数据），模型在多种运动场景下优于ASR-ICA基准。

Conclusion: 结合IMU信号能有效提升EEG运动伪影去除效果，推动BCI实际应用。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Conclusion: RefineStat为小语言模型生成高质量概率程序提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Conclusion: CCE和RankEval为时间序列异常检测提供了更优的评估工具，且开源实现。

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Conclusion: SC-GIR框架能有效学习紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表示，适用于目标导向的通信任务。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Conclusion: 方法成功扩展到非线性情况，保持了理论性质，提升了预测稳定性。

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN对所有节点使用固定消息传递步数，忽略了节点多样性需求。

Method: 提出ADMP-GNN框架，动态调整每个节点的消息传递层数。

Result: 在节点分类任务中表现优于基线GNN模型。

Conclusion: ADMP-GNN通过自适应调整层数，有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

Result: 在多个公开基准数据集上，StoxLSTM表现优于现有方法，具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过随机潜在变量有效提升了xLSTM的性能，适用于复杂时间序列建模。

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种关系保持损失（RPL），用于在降维过程中保留向量空间的关键性质（如正交性和线性独立性），并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降维可能会扭曲向量空间的关键性质（如正交性和线性独立性），而这些性质对跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了关系保持损失（RPL），通过最小化高维数据与其低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵（如Gram或余弦矩阵）的差异来保留这些性质。

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL在降维的同时，能显著保留下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: RPL不仅适用于降维，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐、迁移学习、知识蒸馏等领域，保持几何一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Result: 提升了特征空间的类内紧凑性和类间分离性，增强了对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物与人工智能系统的学习物理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的衡量标准MPC，用于量化GNN解决任务的实际难度，超越了传统的表达能力理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的表达能力理论过于理想化，无法反映GNN的实际能力，且对大多数任务来说，过高的表达能力并非必要。

Method: 提出了Message Passing Complexity (MPC)，一种连续衡量标准，通过消息传递量化GNN解决任务的难度。

Result: MPC的理论预测与实证性能相关，能够解释GNN架构的成功与失败。

Conclusion: MPC为理解和改进GNN架构提供了更强大和细致的框架，弥补了理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在大规模场景中优于集中式和独立基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少通信的同时，实现了局部和全局目标的协调。

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: 迭代示例选择策略能有效提升LLMs的泛化能力，尤其是在组合规则任务中，简单示例可能优于复杂示例。

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且灵活性不足，现有神经算子模型难以捕捉多尺度行为和物理对称性。

Method: 结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率U形架构，通过调节平移等变性来对齐物理规律。

Result: E-UNO在细尺度和高频结构上表现优异，泛化能力强且训练数据需求低。

Conclusion: E-UNO是复杂相场系统的高效替代模型，具有物理一致性。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于重建不确定性估计（RUE）的方法，用于生成生命体征预测的校准预测区间（PIs），以提高临床决策的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中表现出潜力，但由于缺乏可靠的不确定性量化，临床医生难以信任和解释模型输出，限制了其在医疗领域的应用。

Method: 提出了两种方法：参数化的高斯copula方法和非参数的KNN方法，分别适用于不同频率的生命信号数据。

Result: 高斯copula方法在低频数据上优于基线，KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RUE衍生的PIs为临床提供了可解释且具有不确定性的生命体征预测，展示了其在医疗领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，DEPO表现优于现有方法，仅用20%数据即可实现1.85倍（AIME24）和1.66倍（AIME25）加速。

Conclusion: DEPO通过高效数据选择显著提升训练效率，为大规模推理模型提供了可行的优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为优化问题提供了理论支持的全局指导，优于启发式自适应方法。

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Result: AT损失函数在Lipschitz常数、预测性能评估、一致性实验和消融研究中表现优越。

Conclusion: AT损失函数优于传统方法，适用于降水预测的优化问题。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Conclusion: 该方法通过因果分析显著减少混淆偏差，并在时空轨迹预测等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Method: 提出CbLDM模型，利用条件潜在扩散模型和拉普拉斯矩阵替代距离矩阵，以减少重构误差。

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用层次图结构和自适应随机游走来解决消息传递架构在长距离依赖建模上的不足的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消息传递架构在节点和图预测任务中难以充分建模长距离依赖关系。

Method: 通过引入可学习的转移概率，决定随机游走是在原始图上还是通过层次捷径进行。

Result: 在合成长距离任务中，该方法超越了传统方法的理论限制，层次优先的游走与原始图上更长游走表现相当。

Conclusion: 这些初步发现为高效处理大图并有效捕捉长距离依赖开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

Motivation: 解决VQ-VAE因潜在空间过大导致概率推理不可行的问题。

Result: 在密度估计和条件生成任务中表现优异，挑战VQ-VAE固有的不可处理性观点。

Conclusion: VQ-VAE可通过蒸馏实现高效推理，同时保持生成能力。

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了实例依赖成本敏感（IDCS）分类器在信用评分中的成本效率及其对模型解释稳定性的影响，发现IDCS分类器虽然提高了成本效率，但解释稳定性较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管IDCS分类器在信用评分中表现出成本效率优势，但其对模型解释稳定性的影响尚未被研究，而监管对透明度的要求日益增加。

Method: 使用四个公开的信用评分数据集，评估IDCS分类器的判别力和成本效率，并通过控制重采样研究SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名的稳定性。

Result: IDCS分类器提高了成本效率，但解释稳定性显著低于传统模型，尤其是在类别不平衡增加时。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在追求成本优化的同时，必须解决IDCS分类器的解释稳定性问题，以确保其优势不被不稳定的解释所削弱。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Motivation: 传统PDE求解器计算开销大，MD-PNOP旨在加速参数化PDE求解，同时严格保持物理约束。

Method: 将参数偏差的残差转化为源项，利用预训练的神经算子离线优化解，嵌入迭代求解器作为初始猜测。

Result: 在多种参数分布下，MD-PNOP减少50%计算时间，保持高精度。

Conclusion: MD-PNOP为参数化PDE求解提供高效、物理约束保持的加速方案。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

Conclusion: 总结了几何框架与深度RL接口的开放挑战。

Abstract: Reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation are often
studied as separate objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a
unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror
descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两步层次方法，通过利用大型语言模型生成详细描述，并结合检索机制，显著提升了运动描述生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注的高层次运动描述数据，但这些数据稀缺且缺乏低层次细节。

Method: 1. 使用大型语言模型生成详细描述；2. 引入检索机制对齐低层次描述与候选高层次描述。

Result: 在三个数据集上，性能提升6%到50%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过外部文本知识显著提升了运动描述的准确性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Result: 在CrossDocked2020基准测试中，PAFlow实现了最高的结合亲和力（平均Vina评分-8.31），同时保持了良好的分子性质。

Conclusion: PAFlow通过创新的交互指导和原子数预测，显著提升了分子生成的准确性和亲和力，为药物设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Result: 在四个公开ECG数据集上验证了框架的有效性，能识别新异常并保持对现有信号的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在解决存储限制和类别不平衡问题上表现出色，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Result: 显著减少平均遗忘，提高准确性，同时降低内存和运行时间。

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了高效且有效的解决方案，适用于多媒体应用。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Conclusion: 未来研究需关注数据集大小在基准测试中的作用，并设计避免性能停滞的GCL算法。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac引导的CFM为精确控制生成样本提供了新工具，尤其在复杂化学问题中表现出色。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

Motivation: 随着越来越多的微调模型公开，模型合并的安全性引发关注，现有方法无法有效防止非法合并。

Method: 利用Transformer模型中注意力机制的对称性，随机采样两对可逆矩阵并应用于QK和VO分支，保持输出不变但远离共享参数空间。

Result: 实验表明，MergeLock在大多数情况下可将合并模型的性能降低95%以上，且无法通过低成本方法恢复。

Conclusion: MergeLock能有效防止未经授权的模型合并，增强安全性。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

Result: 在GEO-BLEU和DTW指标上达到最优性能，收敛速度提升至2.92倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了移动预测的准确性和训练效率。

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Conclusion: 控制偏差可提升梯度因果发现的可靠性，现有方法改进后能有效应对偏差。

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

Conclusion: RTB可视为KL正则化RL的一种形式，为生成模型微调提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Motivation: 改进DeepONet框架，在保持简单高效的同时提升精度，适应不同PDE的特性。

Method: 引入双向交叉条件，将查询点信息注入分支网络，输入函数信息注入主干网络。

Result: 在四个PDE基准测试中，某些变体精度超过改进版DeepONet，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 交叉条件的有效性依赖于PDE的特性，变体选择需结合方程物理特性。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Conclusion: RL改进的小模型在ML工程任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Result: 多模态集成模型表现最佳，ROC-AUC达到92%，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于车辆损坏检测，还可扩展到汽车安全和自动驾驶领域。

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Conclusion: SoLS通过优化策略更新机制和样本利用效率，在多轮任务中表现出色，为强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

Result: 新方法显著提升了脑与非脑独立成分的分类准确性，并生成可分离的时空滤波器。

Conclusion: 通过频谱归一化改进EEG信号处理，为临床诊断中的自动化分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

Conclusion: BM-CL将公平性与持续学习结合，为开发既公平又有效的机器学习系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Conclusion: MBT-CB能有效捕捉不确定性和时间动态，有望改善CVD生物标志物预测和临床决策支持。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Conclusion: TSAIA Benchmark为LLMs在时间序列分析中的应用提供了科学严谨的评估框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at

Result: 实验表明，动作屏蔽显著提升策略性能，结合正向奖励进一步优化效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在圣劳伦斯湾验证有效，平衡了燃料效率、时间、风阻和路径多样性。

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增强上下文学习的全保形预测框架（E-ICL+FCP），通过模拟多次重训练模型，显著提高了数据效率和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统保形预测方法（SCP和FCP）在数据效率和计算复杂度上存在互补的局限性，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的上下文学习模型，结合CP感知损失函数，模拟FCP的多次重训练过程。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，E-ICL+FCP在效率和覆盖率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP是一种高效且可靠的保形预测方法，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

TL;DR: GradES是一种基于梯度的早期停止方法，通过监控Transformer组件中的梯度幅度来动态冻结参数，显著减少训练时间并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早期停止方法需要全局验证损失监控，计算成本高，尤其是在大型Transformer中。GradES旨在通过组件级别的梯度监控减少计算开销。

Method: GradES在训练过程中跟踪注意力投影和前馈层矩阵的梯度幅度，当梯度低于阈值时冻结该组件，避免全局验证。

Result: GradES将训练速度提高了1.57-7.22倍，同时通过防止过拟合使平均准确性提高了1.2%。

Conclusion: GradES通过组件级别的梯度监控，实现了高效训练和更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Motivation: 现有基于权重的特征分析方法存在性能下降和数据效率低的问题，需要一种既能保持性能又能实现可解释性的方法。

Method: 设计了Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS)激活函数，用于Gated Linear Units (GLUs)。

Result: 实验表明SQS在性能上与最先进的激活函数相当，同时实现了基于权重的可解释性。

Conclusion: SQS是一种有效的激活函数，能够在保持高性能的同时实现模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with

<details>

Motivation: 传统固定路线公交在低密度地区效率低，而完全按需服务成本高。本文旨在结合两者的优势，提高服务效率和适应性。

Method: 使用深度强化学习（PPO算法）动态分配车辆到分区，结合固定路线和按需服务。通过基于代理的仿真在慕尼黑真实公交路线上验证。

Result: 动态分区控制的半按需服务比传统固定路线多服务16%乘客，成本增加13%。强化学习控制带来2.4%的乘客增长和1.4%的成本增加。

Conclusion: 研究展示了共享自动驾驶车辆和机器学习在公共交通中的潜力，为解决多模式交通系统中的首末英里问题奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Motivation: 传统优化方法在灾后道路评估中计算时间长且需要专业知识，无法满足时间敏感的需求。

Method: 采用深度强化学习，结合网络转换方法和合成路网生成技术，训练多任务学习模型。

Result: AEDM在解质量上优于商业求解器16-69%，且推理时间仅1-2秒，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和解质量间取得平衡，适用于时间关键的灾后应急响应。

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了ADAS功能与传统车辆属性如何共同预测车辆获得NCAP最高安全评级（5星）的可能性，通过机器学习模型分析发现，车辆基本特征（如重量和年份）和ADAS功能均对预测有重要贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解主动安全技术（ADAS）与传统车辆属性如何共同影响NCAP安全评级，以提升车辆安全评估的准确性。

Method: 使用包含5,128辆车的NCAP数据集，比较了四种机器学习模型（逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升、SVC），并通过5折分层交叉验证和超参数优化选择最佳模型。

Result: 优化的随机森林模型在测试集上表现最佳，准确率为89.18%，ROC AUC为0.9586。车辆基本特征（如重量和年份）贡献最大，但ADAS功能也有显著预测价值。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合传统车辆属性和现代ADAS功能的机器学习模型能有效预测NCAP最高安全评级，为车辆安全评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态调整噪声注入来提升深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用均匀噪声或固定丢弃率，无法针对不同节点的梯度波动性进行自适应调整。VISP旨在通过梯度波动性指导噪声注入，以更有效地防止过拟合。

Method: VISP从梯度统计中动态计算波动性，并利用其缩放随机投影矩阵，从而选择性地对高波动性的输入和隐藏节点进行正则化。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP显著优于基线模型和固定噪声方法，同时稳定了网络内部动态并增强了特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过动态噪声注入机制有效提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且能自动发现U-Net架构的优化原则。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Motivation: 探讨新皮层是否具备情景记忆能力及其与语义记忆的关系，挑战互补学习系统理论的二元性。

Method: 提出一种预测编码模型，测试其在少量和大量训练样本下的情景记忆能力。

Result: 模型在少量样本下能回忆具体例子但会过拟合，而在大量样本下失去回忆能力，表明情景记忆可能源于语义学习。

Conclusion: 新皮层可通过密集重叠表征编码有限数量的具体例子，但需要海马的稀疏分离表征来支持更多情景记忆。

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Result: 理论分析了图扰动下的稳定性和谱特性相关的过平滑行为，为连续图学习提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: So-TPDEGs框架为多领域连续图学习提供了稳健的理论基础。

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能生成高性能规则，还提供了更可解释的规则设计思路。

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

TL;DR: 研究发现，公平比较优化器需严格超参数调优和全面评估，实际速度提升低于宣称，且随模型规模减小。

Motivation: 解决优化器比较中的方法论缺陷，如超参数调优不平等和评估设置有限或误导。

Method: 系统研究十种优化器，覆盖四种模型规模和数据-模型比例，严格调优和评估。

Result: 矩阵优化器速度提升随模型规模减小，0.1B模型1.4x，1.2B模型仅1.1x。

Conclusion: 公平比较需全面评估，矩阵优化器速度优势随模型规模减小。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层优化框架，用于在隐私保护和数据效用之间找到平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐私保护技术（如数据扰动）导致数据准确性、特异性和多样性下降的问题。

Method: 采用双层优化框架，上层任务关注数据效用，下层任务关注隐私保护，利用局部外在曲率量化隐私风险。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抵抗成员推理攻击的同时，提升了样本质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和数据效用之间实现了协同平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Motivation: 开发LUCIE-3D是为了扩展LUCIE-2D框架，以更全面地模拟大气垂直结构和耦合气候动力学。

Method: 采用球形傅里叶神经算子（SFNO）作为主干，基于30年的ERA5再分析数据训练，支持CO2强迫和可选的海表温度耦合。

Result: 模型成功复现了气候均值、变率和长期气候变化信号，包括CO2增加下的地表增温和平流层冷却，并捕捉了关键动力学过程。

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D在稳定性、物理一致性和可访问性方面表现优异，适用于快速实验和耦合气候动力学研究。

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量样本方面表现出色，但在稀疏且分布不均匀的数据（如蛋白质数据）中，现有方法忽略了数据依赖的变异性。

Method: 使用KDE预处理步骤估计每个数据点的噪声尺度σ，并训练一个基于这些σ值的分数模型，将局部数据几何融入去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个指标上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 数据感知的σ预测对于稀疏高维数据中的生成建模至关重要。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 职业事故报告分类对工作场所安全至关重要，但类别不平衡问题影响了模型性能，尤其是罕见但严重的事故类型。

Method: ABEX-RAT结合了抽象-扩展（ABEX）数据增强和随机对抗训练（RAT），生成高质量合成样本并提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在OSHA数据集上，ABEX-RAT达到了90.32%的宏F1分数，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ABEX-RAT是一种高效且有效的解决方案，适用于不平衡分类任务。

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图方法仅依赖共同信息，忽略了独特信息的潜在预测能力。

Method: CIML通过最大化Gacs-Korner共同信息提取共享特征，并利用信息瓶颈压缩任务相关表示；同时压缩独特表示并最小化其与共同表示之间的互信息。

Result: 实验证明CIML优于现有方法，且理论证明其联合表示对下游任务具有预测充分性。

Conclusion: CIML通过结合共同和独特信息，提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Result: 方法在任务数量增加时仍保持稳健，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多任务学习中的任务干扰问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了可微分EM的实际应用，还贡献了MW₂的理论稳定性结果和新变体，为相关领域提供了新的工具和理论支持。

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical

this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset

nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level

detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with

aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau

\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic

dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in

recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior

significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设更准确的预测会带来更接近最优解的结果，但这一假设在复杂约束优化问题中缺乏实证支持。

Method: 通过模拟机器学习模型的预测（包括新提出的多分类器模拟算法），实验分析预测误差对解质量的影响。

Result: 实验表明，分类器性能可以较准确地模拟，但预测误差与解质量的关系并非简单线性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预测误差对优化解质量的非平凡影响，为基于机器学习的决策系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Motivation: 现有自动微分框架存在编程语言支持有限、需代码修改、科学计算性能不足等问题，限制了其在大规模问题中的应用。

Conclusion: DaCe AD 提供了一种通用且高效的自动微分解决方案，适用于科学计算和机器学习领域。

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法反映医疗咨询的动态交互性，导致医疗大语言模型在实际临床决策中的实用性不足。

Method: 提出动态验证框架，包括患者模拟器和临床评分生成器，并开发了Baichuan-M2模型，采用改进的GRPO算法进行训练。

Result: Baichuan-M2在HealthBench上表现优于其他开源模型和多数闭源模型，得分超过32。

Conclusion: 动态验证系统对提升医疗大语言模型的临床实用性至关重要，为医疗AI部署建立了新的性能-参数权衡前沿。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效建模跨多时空尺度的依赖关系。

Method: 提出STPM模块提取多尺度时空特征，AHM模块学习稀疏超图捕捉高阶依赖，并通过三相超图传播交互特征。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，ST-Hyper在长短期预测中平均MAE分别降低3.8%和6.8%。

Conclusion: ST-Hyper通过自适应超图建模显著提升了多元时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Result: 在聚集任务中，VariAntNet的收敛速度是现有解析方法的两倍以上，同时保持高凝聚力。

Conclusion: VariAntNet在时间关键场景中优于传统方法，但需权衡速度与智能体损失。

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

Conclusion: 校准作为一种不可区分性概念，为决策者提供了评估预测器可靠性的工具。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UDI的新策略，通过放弃传统的联合损失函数，采用主动的顺序训练方案来解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态学习方法通常使用联合损失函数，但容易导致模态不平衡，强模态压制弱模态，限制了各模态信息的充分利用和模态间交互信息的挖掘。

Method: UDI策略首先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后利用其学习到的表示通过无监督损失指导其他模态，并通过动态调整模态交互来优化任务表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，提升了多模态学习任务的性能。

Conclusion: UDI通过解耦模态优化和定向信息流，避免了单一模态的支配，促进了有效的跨模态特征学习。

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

Result: AdaSwitch在多种场景（如处理系统、k-server问题、资源分配）中表现灵活且广泛适用。

Conclusion: 该框架和算法为学习增强的在线决策提供了灵活且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个真实数据集上表现优于其他主流过采样方法，尤其在严重不平衡情况下。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了文本数据中的类别不平衡问题，为文本分类任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

Result: 在八个多元数据集上，RDIT实现了更低的CRPS、快速推理和更好的覆盖性。

Conclusion: RDIT在概率时间序列预测中表现出色，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

Method: 通过调整CSG计算参数（M和K），在标准数据集（如FB15k-237、WN18RR）上进行实验，分析其与性能指标（如MRR）的相关性。

Result: CSG对参数K高度敏感，且与性能指标相关性弱，无法稳定预测下游任务表现。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测任务中表现不佳，需开发更稳健的复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法为网络训练提供了无需验证数据集的停止准则，并在实际成像实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该算法在合成数据集和实际MoE使用场景中优于传统LRU。

Conclusion: 层扩展LRU算法能有效优化LLM专家管理，提升缓存效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM通过寻找平坦的损失函数谷底来提升泛化能力，但实际中对抗扰动可能过于友好，限制了泛化效果。

Method: 提出VASSO方法，通过抑制对抗扰动的方差来稳定扰动，从而提升泛化能力。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务中验证了VASSO结合SAM能显著提升泛化性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: VASSO是一种通用的稳定对抗扰动的方法，能够有效提升SAM的泛化能力，同时兼顾计算效率。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Motivation: 通知推送是重要的信息传递渠道，但现有离线强化学习方法（如CQL）在规模应用时存在稳定性、可解释性等问题。

Method: 采用决策变换器框架，将策略学习重新定义为基于回报的监督学习，并设计了多奖励机制、分位数回归方法以及生产就绪的系统。

Result: 在实际通知系统中，DT方法比CQL方法提升了0.72%的会话量，同时减少了用户疲劳。

Conclusion: DT框架在通知推送任务中表现出更高的鲁棒性和可扩展性，能够有效提升推送效果。

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Motivation: 解决能源网络中机器学习研究缺乏公开电力系统数据的问题。

Method: 利用ENGAGE和DINGO两个开源数据集，评估四种解码器变体，并通过结构和频谱指标比较生成网络与原网格。

Result: 简单解码器无法捕捉真实拓扑，GCN方法在ENGAGE上表现良好，但在DINGO上产生断开组件和重复模式等问题。

Conclusion: VGAE在电网合成中具有潜力但存在局限性，需要更具表现力的生成模型和更鲁棒的评估方法。

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮TIR在强化学习中存在训练不稳定和性能崩溃问题，主要由外部工具反馈引起的分布漂移导致。

Method: 提出SimpleTIR算法，通过识别并过滤无效轨迹（无代码块或最终答案的轮次），阻止有害梯度，稳定训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中表现优异，AIME24分数从22.1提升至50.5，并促进多样化推理模式。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR有效解决了多轮TIR的训练不稳定问题，同时提升了模型性能和推理多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Motivation: 传统的数据驱动方法忽略了流域的拓扑信息，而现有的GNN方法因计算成本高而无法处理高分辨率数据，且未能同时捕捉时空依赖性。

Method: 提出异构流域图，将每个像素作为节点，结合水文流向和流域间关系，开发HydroGAT网络自适应学习时空重要性。

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高效分布式训练和可解释的注意力机制，显著提升了洪水预测的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

Result: RNN在长度达训练数据8倍的序列上实现高准确率，92.6%的任务达到近乎完美泛化。

Conclusion: 神经方法学习复杂ω-正则语言可行，有望用于神经符号验证方法。

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Result: 在VLMEvalKit基准测试中，量化后的MoE模型在保持竞争力的同时显著减少了内存占用。

Conclusion: MoPEQ通过混合精度量化为VLM-MoEs提供了高效部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

Conclusion: 替代基准为模型合并超参数优化提供低成本高效解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that

Motivation: 研究稀疏自编码器的缩放行为，特别是特征流形（多维特征）对缩放行为的影响。

Method: 采用容量分配模型（Brill, 2024）分析SAE的缩放规律，并探讨特征流形的作用。

Result: 模型揭示了不同的缩放机制，其中一种机制下，特征流形会导致SAE学习的特征数量远少于潜在变量数量。

Conclusion: 初步讨论了SAE在现实应用中是否处于这种病理机制中。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

Conclusion: IOG框架有效提升了火灾场景下的智能感知和响应能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Motivation: 自动车辆定位（AVL）数据因更新频率不一致影响效果，需轨迹重建以提高分析质量。

Method: 评估13种轨迹重建方法，包括新方法，结合高分辨率AVL数据，分析速度、位置、平滑和数据密度的影响。

Result: 速度感知方法表现最佳，VCHIP-ME在准确性和效率上最优，平滑方法在复杂环境中可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 建议采用VCHIP-ME方法，并投资高频AVL数据收集，以提高轨迹重建的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的任务驱动探索方法，用于机器人动态任务中物理属性的快速准确估计，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态机器人任务中，机器人需要快速准确地估计物体的物理属性以成功执行任务，且无法从失败中恢复或重试。

Method: 采用强化学习训练探索策略，利用特权任务策略对属性误差的敏感性自动生成奖励，并引入不确定性机制决定何时从探索过渡到任务执行。

Result: 在击球任务中达到90%的成功率，平均探索时间低于1.2秒，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别物体属性并调整任务执行，适用于实际物理环境中的机器人任务。

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

Result: 在基准控制任务和真实机器人（Go2四足机器人）上验证了方法的有效性，兼具高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持通用性的同时，实现了高效的一阶策略优化，避免了其他基于模型方法的缺陷。

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

Motivation: 机器人在处理视觉模糊物体时，生成模型在模糊情况下表现不佳，即使考虑了动作历史。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，该方法在模拟和真实环境中均优于基线。

Conclusion: HAVE通过解耦生成与验证，显著提高了动作质量，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中验证了TReF-6的鲁棒性，支持跨多样物体配置的任务意图保留。

Conclusion: TReF-6通过抽象空间表示提升了一次性模仿学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Motivation: 太空环境中机器人自主操作面临感知与运动不确定性、严格运动约束和有限人工干预机会等挑战，需要高效的规划方法。

Method: TMP-EAOG通过迭代扩展AND/OR图，集成任务级抽象和运动规划可行性评估，具备鲁棒性、可控自主性和灵活性。

Result: 在模拟移动机械臂的基准测试中，TMP-EAOG能有效应对多种挑战。

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG为太空机器人自主操作提供了一种适应性强的规划解决方案。

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态胃环境中导航柔性内窥镜具有挑战性，需要有效利用与胃壁的接触来达到目标位置。

Method: 使用基于物理的有限元方法（FEM）模拟胃环境，并通过近端策略优化（PPO）算法训练深度强化学习模型。

Result: 在静态和动态胃环境中，CAN策略实现了100%的成功率和1.6毫米的平均误差，在未见过的挑战性场景中保持85%的成功率。

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的CAN策略显著优于现有方法，提升了柔性内窥镜的导航性能。

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

Conclusion: 展示了可解释的VLA组件可用于控制，为机器人领域透明且可引导的基础模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

Motivation: 可变形连续体机器人（DCRs）的非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性违反了传统强化学习的马尔可夫假设，雅可比方法的应用也受限于时变运动学和欠驱动变形动力学。

Conclusion: JEDP-RL通过雅可比特征增强状态表示，显著提升了DCRs的规划性能，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Abstract: Traditional aggregate sorting methods, whether manual or mechanical, often

these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm
system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining
applications. The system integrates a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a
binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework.
Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate
detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic
modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size
estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment.
Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping
and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy.
Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and
texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates
significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and
improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource
for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban
intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing
datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information
richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a
fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban
signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for
drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection
types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000
TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts
per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw
videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements
validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification
of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of
interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining,
traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and
reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning.
Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points,
whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory.
Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and

novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off.
Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed
geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances
computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive

Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving
the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert
pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual
sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction
process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these
limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion
platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our
platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes,
including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational
spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector
to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for
multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our
device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control
scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of
tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool
insertion efficacy.

Result: 在MuJoCo模拟的差分驱动移动机器人上验证了控制器性能，优于原始CTC和传统运动学控制器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合CTC和DRL，显著提升了样本效率和闭环稳定性。

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

Conclusion: 演示学习为电影拍摄提供了一种鲁棒、免奖励的解决方案，降低了技术门槛，实现了艺术意图与机器人自主性的结合。

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired

evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of
VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the
lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous
vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the
absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz

teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour

smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by

Conclusion: CDF-MPPI框架在高效性和有效性上优于传统方法，适用于高维运动规划。

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

Abstract: This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous
driving in heterogeneous traffic. To capture diverse human behaviors, we
propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits
to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These
parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model.
To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical
lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins,
time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM
data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two
15-vehicle scenarios, and NGSIM-based trials, consistently outperforming
conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a
scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world
autonomous driving applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合任务空间速度场和关节空间二次规划（QP）的分层框架，用于多自由度夹爪的快速反应抓取。


<details>

Result: 通过仿真和真实实验验证，该方法能使高自由度臂手系统在动态环境中实时执行无碰撞运动。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高自由度系统的实时规划问题，适应动态环境和外部干扰。

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

Result: 数值模拟验证了FPE-MPC在管理软机器人系统不确定性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: FPE-MPC为解决软机器人控制中的不确定性问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

Conclusion: SRR-SLAM显著提升了自主机器人感知系统的测量精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

Conclusion: PRBM plus LDM是一种计算高效且精确的软体执行器建模技术，可实现稳定灵活的抓取和精确的力调节。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

Abstract: Multi-agent distributed collaborative mapping provides comprehensive and
efficient representations for robots. However, existing approaches lack
instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting
their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we

Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure
consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation

Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization

of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,

knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward
distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more

Abstract: As robot technology advances, collaboration between humans and robots will
become more prevalent in industrial tasks. When humans run into issues in such
scenarios, a likely future involves relying on artificial agents or robots for

examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans
engaged in HRC tasks.

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且可部署于边缘设备，显著提升机器人6D位姿估计任务的表现。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Result: 提出了机器人如何为LGBTQ+群体服务的具体方向，并引发伦理思考。

Conclusion: 展望了LGBTQ+机器人技术的未来，强调实现这些愿景所需的努力。

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+
populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about
what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的基于检索的模仿学习方法（IWR），通过高斯核密度估计（KDE）计算重要性权重，解决了现有方法对噪声敏感和忽略先验数据分布的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模任务特定数据集在模仿学习中至关重要，但现有基于检索的方法依赖高方差的最近邻估计且忽略先验数据分布，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入重要性加权检索（IWR），使用高斯KDE估计目标数据与先验数据分布的概率比，平滑噪声并优化数据选择。

Result: 在仿真环境和真实数据集（Bridge）上，IWR显著提升了现有基于检索方法的性能。

Conclusion: IWR通过简单修改有效解决了现有方法的不足，为小规模数据集模仿学习提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Result: 在OVMM和真实世界实验中，MoTo的成功率分别比现有方法高2.68%和16.67%。

Conclusion: MoTo通过零样本方式实现了高效的移动操作，无需专家数据，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

Motivation: 理解铰接物体的3D运动对机器人场景理解、移动操作和运动规划至关重要，但现有方法在非受控环境中表现不佳。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪和因子图优化框架，直接从RGB-D视频中估计铰接部分轨迹和铰接轴。

Result: 在Arti4D数据集上，ArtiPoint表现优于经典和基于学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint在非受控环境中表现优异，并公开了代码和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅能过滤不安全动作，还能用于条件动作生成。

Conclusion: 约束解码框架有效提升了机器人基础模型的安全性和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Conclusion: Fail2Progress通过高效生成失败场景数据，显著提升了模型从失败中恢复的能力。

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

Motivation: 传统强化学习中直接惩罚能量消耗需要精细调整权重，可能导致任务性能下降。本文旨在避免这种权衡。

Method: 采用策略梯度投影方法，在任务和能量目标之间优化策略更新，确保能量最小化不影响任务表现。

Result: 在DM-Control和HumanoidBench基准测试中，能量消耗减少64%，同时保持任务性能。Sim2Real实验验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法易于实现，适用于任何策略梯度方法，为高效能量控制提供了理论替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

Abstract: This paper introduces ManiFlow, a visuomotor imitation learning policy for
general robot manipulation that generates precise, high-dimensional actions
conditioned on diverse visual, language and proprioceptive inputs. We leverage
flow matching with consistency training to enable high-quality dexterous action

efficiently, we propose DiT-X, a diffusion transformer architecture with
adaptive cross-attention and AdaLN-Zero conditioning that enables fine-grained
feature interactions between action tokens and multi-modal observations.
ManiFlow demonstrates consistent improvements across diverse simulation
benchmarks and nearly doubles success rates on real-world tasks across
single-arm, bimanual, and humanoid robot setups with increasing dexterity. The
extensive evaluation further demonstrates the strong robustness and
generalizability of ManiFlow to novel objects and background changes, and

Result: 在大规模真实AIS数据上表现优异，超越传统单船舶预测误差，并能量化潜在碰撞风险。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强海上安全和决策支持提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R²显著提升了自动驾驶系统的推理和自省能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ATE的数据高效、即插即用框架，用于解决VLA模型在下游任务中的适应性问题，显著提升了跨任务和跨机器人平台的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在适应下游任务时，由于机器人形态或任务与预训练数据的差异，导致动作分布不匹配，需要大量数据和计算资源进行微调。

Method: ATE通过构建统一潜在空间对齐动作空间，并利用变分自编码器和反向KL散度约束，结合扩散或流模型的生成过程引导机制，实现高效适应。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的跨形态和跨任务实验中，ATE比直接微调VLA模型平均多任务成功率提升9.8%（仿真）和32%（真实世界）。

Conclusion: ATE提供了一种通用且轻量级的解决方案，显著提升了VLA模型在新机器人平台和任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

*Guangzhen Sun,Ye Ding,Xiangyang Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何代数的新方法，用于解析确定机器人系统的基础惯性参数，并通过算法自动识别所有基础参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在确定机器人系统的基础惯性参数时缺乏几何直观性和计算效率，尤其是在复杂机构中。

Method: 使用投影几何代数重新表述刚体动力学，提出TP模型，并基于三个几何原理开发了自动确定基础参数的算法（DRNG）。

Result: 在四种机器人上验证了方法的有效性，成功识别了所有基础参数，表现出高鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性、鲁棒性和高效性，特别适用于复杂机构。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

Result: 初步应用于排队场景，展示了方法的潜力，未来可推广至更多人类活动。

Conclusion: HPLSV为机器人导航提供了社会规范的学习框架，有望提升机器人在复杂社交场景中的表现。

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Result: 通过模拟研究验证了运动级优化的简化对高层优化结果的影响，并在两个码垛场景中找到了时间最优的机器人设计。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效平衡了计算复杂性和解决方案质量，为工业机器人性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous
navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g.,
camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual
occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In
this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language
instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating
strong generalization in practical scenarios. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在有限数据条件下表现优异，优于基线模型，适用于复杂生物环境。

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and

technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems
provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world,
partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an
assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

Result: 揭示了VBTS技术当前面临的挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该分类方法为VBTS技术的研究和应用提供了系统化的框架，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.
