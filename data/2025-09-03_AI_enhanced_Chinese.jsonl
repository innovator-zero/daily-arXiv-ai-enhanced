Inspired by memory consolidation in\nthe human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed\nby~\\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of\nprior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the\nmost influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their\nframework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using\nthe CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with\nSynaptic Intelligence (SI).

This research evaluates 13 trajectory\nreconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using\nhigh-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four\ncritical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on\nreconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of\nthese methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the\ntrade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework\ncombines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity\nwith practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning\nvelocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed\nvariability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each\nmethod in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our\nfindings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform\nposition-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based\nmethods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban\nenvironments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical.

Ali", "Anis Koubaa", "Bilel Benjdira"], "title": "Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing", "comment": null, "summary": "Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital\nimages, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in\nthe computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSGLC\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u96fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u96fe\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u96be\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "SGLC\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08GFG\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\uff08LFE\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSGLC\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PSNR\u3002", "conclusion": "SGLC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u96fe\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on\nthis scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show\nthat a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at\nchance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for\ndetecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method\napplied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with\nan area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a\nnegative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be\nused to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the\ncosts and time associated with drug development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80be\u810f\u6bd2\u7406\u5b66\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u836f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u80be\u810f\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u67e5\u5927\u91cf\u6b63\u5e38\u5207\u7247\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528UNI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u4e3a0.62\uff0c\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u4e3a89%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u6392\u9664\u6b63\u5e38\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

Two key aspects of\nthe algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and\naccuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous\nlines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms\nwith optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for\npower-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$\nextend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that\nworsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded\nerror but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$\nalgorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our\ndevelopment of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes\nbeyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the\n$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an\nimage of shape $w \\times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal\ncomputational complexity $\\mathcal{O}(wh \\ln^3 w)$, while keeping the\napproximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and\ncontrollable via a meta-parameter.

Specifically, we introduce a novel\nLanguage-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three\ncomplementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and\nthe textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\npenalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the\ntext-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss\nbased on the labeled shots.

Unlike\nmachine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological\ncues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,\nchromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal\narchitecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain\ndiagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that\nexplicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial\norganization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are\nresilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided\nGeneralization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,\nand nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning\nframework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,\nMorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological\natypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific\nfeatures. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate\nstochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.\nAttention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear\nmorphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors\nor normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience\nof the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining\nartifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but\nalso addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for\ndigital pathology.

The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,\nwhich can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the\nphysical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such\nphysical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.\nThis paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address\nthese challenges.

However, their computational and energy demands have grown\nproportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a\nwider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates\nprincipled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning\nsystems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints\nand non-differentiability.\n  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture\ndesign, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose\nnovel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying\ndiscrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based\ntraining of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These\napproximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,\nleading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning.

While activation steering has\nemerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific\ncontrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal\nperformance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose \\textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM\n(\\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines\nactivation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model\nrobustness. In \\textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering\nvectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful\nbehaviors during inference. In \\textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering\nvectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage\nintegrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards\nbased on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded\ntext generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and\neffectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with\ndeeper policy refinement in Stage II.

This\nbreakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "TConstFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0O(1) KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u548cO(N^2 d)\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5468\u671f\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6bcfk\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fdd\u6301\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eTConstFormer\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "TConstFormer\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However,\ndue to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a\nchallenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual\nmodels to 3D domains through \"high-to-low\" mapping, these approaches often lead\nto the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for\nadapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by\naggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear\nlayers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the\ninherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of\nimages and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the\nrelative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched\nwith location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate\nself-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce\ncomputational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights\nwith the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without\nadding additional parameters.

Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients\nof signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.\nHowever, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the\nSDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have\nbeen introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration\nspace. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and\nthus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free\napproaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage\nlong-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these\nmethods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory\nsamples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost\nfunctions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a\nframework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the\nrobot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost\nin joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting\ncomputation while preserving collision avoidance in practice.

However, this assumption\nimplies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is\nnot enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice.

To explain this apparent\nparadox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is\nbetter understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein\nGradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time\nstochastic differential equation. Under this view, the \"probability flow\"\narises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke\nreverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains\nsuccessful even when the neural vector field is not a true score.

This is an extended version of the\n  original submission", "summary": "Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nacross distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data\nheterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation\npersonalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from\nclients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model\nstates. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid\noverfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even\ncollapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the\nclient side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges\nfor training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first\nto easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,\nclient-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased\npatterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,\nthe curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic\nknowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves\nweighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained\nstructural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph.

To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box\nDistillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under\nrealistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on\nlarge-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot\npredictions only.

Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation\nproperties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this\npaper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the\nmemorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical\ncontributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a\ntransformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length.

However, transferring VLMs from the natural\nimage domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the\nlimited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural\nand RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that\ndecouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at\nboth the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored\nstrategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)\nmodule, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global\nmodifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are\npartitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask\nproposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local\nscale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image\npatches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich\nthe text inputs.

In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated\nLearning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the\nperformance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own\nmodels within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named\nFedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading\nmodified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the\nprivate model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where\n\"divergence\" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that\nintegrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that\nour method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the\nattacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global\nmodel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u79c1\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0fSCFL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FedThief\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u81ea\u8eab\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u7834\u574f\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u81ea\u8eab\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u673a\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u8eab\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedThief\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0a\u4f20\u9636\u6bb5\u7be1\u6539\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5316\u79c1\u6709\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684divergence-aware\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u79c1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SCFL\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u653b\u51fb\u52a8\u673a\uff0cFedThief\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u81ea\u79c1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing\nattention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial\narrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they\ntend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training\ndata, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named\nMV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the\njoint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from\nmulti-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State\nSpace (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial\narrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's\ntraditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning\n(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate\nthat MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU\nPanoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP\n(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about\nwhat aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and\nsciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in\nfiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses\nqueering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot\nroles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building\nand celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by\nimplementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''\nusers, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a\nnetwork of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each\nother, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions\nwhether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.\nFinally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics\nfutures may look like, and what would be required to get there.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LGBTQ+\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6fc0\u53d1\u5173\u4e8eLGBTQ+\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u6848\uff08\u53cd\u6620\u7fa4\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u63a8\u52a8\u793e\u4f1a\u53d8\u9769\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u8d44\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u4e3aLGBTQ+\u7fa4\u4f53\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u601d\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u671b\u4e86LGBTQ+\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u613f\u666f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002"}}

One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset.

These applications place higher demands on model compression\nand inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,\ndue to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs\nface challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies\nlearned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To\naddress these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self\nAttention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier\nKAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.\nThrough the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift\nmechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves\nits nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational\ncomplexity.

Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer\nhave been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted\nthat prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,\nmodeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an\noverwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating\ntime-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,\nbut it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of\nMamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal\nstructure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba\n(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of\nremote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine\nit with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module\nbased on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the\ntwo modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a\nmore powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and\nLiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding.

Since degradation\nis rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate\nhealth assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because\noperational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces\nonly subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect\nshort-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the\nunderlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but\nthe residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in\nnoisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with\ndynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising\nframework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in\nslow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,\nwhile degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation\n(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)\nCDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a\nmulti-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a\nlearnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to\ncontrol degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces\nmonotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and\nsteady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively\ndisentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms\nresidual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable\ninference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08H-CDE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u8981\u53cd\u6620\u77ed\u671f\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u5316\u63a8\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6b8b\u5dee\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800cNODEs\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u503c\u521a\u6027\u548c\u9000\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "H-CDE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u6162\uff08\u9000\u5316\uff09\u548c\u5feb\uff08\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u4e24\u4e2aCDE\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u503c\u521a\u6027\u548c\u9000\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cH-CDE\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9000\u5316\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "H-CDE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing models struggle to generalize across\nconditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.\nIn this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap\nbetween clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective\ndenoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose\nestimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time\napplications.\n  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that\nevaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective\ndetection of sparse and discrete noise.\n  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive\npoint-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local\nregions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity\nthreshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and\nthen perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight\nprediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather.

On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the\nbrain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image\ngeneration capabilities of diffusion models.

Although existing works have recognized this\nproblem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as\nexisting approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses\nto validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli.

Unlike\nconventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for\nconditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between\nvisual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained\nalignment during the generation process.

Second, we introduce a novel method to transform\nthe possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from\nnormalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible\nrepresentation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief\nstructure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors\nclassifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into\ndecision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted\nto evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier\nand the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with\nboth evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The\nresults demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing\nevidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,\nwhile maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and\nrobustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eDempster-Shafer\u7406\u8bba\uff08DST\uff09\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u878d\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u65b0\u7684BPA\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDST\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u96b6\u5c5e\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u548cBPA\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5355\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u7684BPA\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636eK\u8fd1\u90bb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.84%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin\nTransformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail\nrestoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin\nTransformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and\ndecoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning\nof global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial\nfor structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a\ncomposite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel\nwatershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures\npixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse\natmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored\nimages.

We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token\nRouting Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to\ndynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving\nlightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the\nattention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is\nexplicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This\ndesign offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense\nattention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through\nattention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full\nTransformer.

To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step\nclustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,\nand then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with\nMarkov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze\nelevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.\nWhile the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror\nchecks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard\nglances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating\nincreased cognitive focus.

We primarily attribute these limitations to the \"contextual\nillusion dilemma\" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are\noverwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our\npaper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative\n(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded\nimages into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of\ndegraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware\nguidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we\nintroduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated\nfrequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from\npre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a\nvisual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes\ninto the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and\nattribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate\nlatent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their\nsurroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to\nreconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations.

A specialized transformer\nis trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation\nof position/shape and content-aware feature extraction.

This work has been accepted by IEEE TMI", "summary": "Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost\nfor medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as\nMean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on\nconsistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference\nprediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have\noverlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on\nstrategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the\nheterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively\nmining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss\nfunction, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is\nmore essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a\nspatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by\nsimultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between\nthe reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the\npredictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the\nloss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant\nand Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive\nthreshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious\nones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust\nlearning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is\nplug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods.

Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the\ndynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual\nstimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the\nTDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal\nconsistency between the feature representations and the original neural\nrecordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR\ntranslates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video\nreconstruction.

To overcome these limitations, this\npaper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for\ncomprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning\nframework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a\nfine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within\na segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive\n(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby\ngenerating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything\nModel (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt\nfor effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include\nan Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)\nmodule to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented\nMixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to\nsignificantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.\nComprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate\nthat SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits\nremarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via\nSegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA.

While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting\nthese signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because\nclinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable\nuncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals\n(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a\nmeaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical\ndecision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from\nthe Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure\nwell-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and\nsupport for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that\nprediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula\ndistribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,\nbased on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional\nerror distribution using similar validation instances.

We\nmodel the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which\nwe build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene\nnavigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and\na planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.\nCritically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned\npath. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the\nstochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical\nconsistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we\nleverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,\nsignificantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.\nExtensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that\nFantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of\ngeneralization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

Most existing\ngenerative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on\nrecovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing\nthat a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity\nand variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.\nInspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.\nIn this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative\nparadigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then\nreconstructs one from the other.

The cross-reconstruction significantly\nincreases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which\nenables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods\nin 3D self-supervised learning.

Currently,\nexisting CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to\nenhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.\nHowever, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of\nknowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential.

These refined annotations are used\nto retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.\nSecond, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism.

Through\nsimulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms\ninterference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.\nFurthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our\nframework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact\ninterventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive\npersonalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAddIPW\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\uff08SUTVA\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AddIPW\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u54cd\u5e94\u53d8\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u589e\u91cf\u5229\u6da6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5229\u6da6\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo\nonly reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of\nhairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing\nmethods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,\nhowever, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work\nfrom skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic\nrenderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real\nand synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we\ntrain a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of\nthe internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process\nto model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible\nhair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D\nstructure of hairstyles.

Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are\nvoxel-based and pillarbased approaches.

Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of\nvoxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel\npoint cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the\nhorizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main\ncontributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique\nthat converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The\nmodel only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as\nseparate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and\nenhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network\n(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN\ninto the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception\ncapability.

In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the\nability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during\nthe skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could\npotentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,\nutilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs\nvarying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the\ndecoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature\nmaps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by\nthis advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving\nDice coefficient scores of 86.49\\%, 92.56\\%, 93.37\\%, and 92.98\\% on the\nSynapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,\nrespectively.

Notably,\nour extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map\nbetween datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters\nin an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing\nbrain versus non-brain ICs.\n  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring\nof multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG\nanalysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent\ncomponent analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context\n(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the\nperformance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized\nby appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684CMMN\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6e90\u53c2\u8003\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdbEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u72ec\u7acb\u6210\u5206\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u9891\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55CMMN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6e90\u53c2\u8003\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u901a\u9053\u5e73\u5747\u548c$l_1$\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91cd\u5fc3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8111\u4e0e\u975e\u8111\u72ec\u7acb\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6539\u8fdbEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph\nthat incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both\ncamera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current\nmethods.

To address the ill-posedness of LACT\nreconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured\nclinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model\nconditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient\ndemographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors\nfrom noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the\ncoarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data\nconsistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the\nmeasured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac\nCT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves\nreconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation.

To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity\nmulti-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational\ncost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill\nsampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for\nfaster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel\ncontinuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell\nwithin a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search\ndimension (number of variables).

Federated learning (FL),\nby contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training\nacross naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world\nCAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of\ntraining and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.\nPractical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity\nfrom non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,\nand (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside\nsystematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance.

To address these two issues, we conduct a\nsystematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales\n(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).\nWe find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter\ntuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,\nperformed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one\noptimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer\nunfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned\nbaselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for\n1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before\nreaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two\noptimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our\nthorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon\nand Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with\nmatrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based\noptimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over\nAdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5ba3\u79f0\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6709\u9650\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5341\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u636e-\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c0.1B\u6a21\u578b1.4x\uff0c1.2B\u6a21\u578b\u4ec51.1x\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u9700\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002"}}

While this approach\nachieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles\nwith precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced\ndivision of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding\nmodule is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning\ntasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable\nSANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM\ndataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,\nDIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and\nGEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1\nand Step1X-Edit.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space\nthroughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the\nflexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,\nboth of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.\nIn the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground\nand background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional\ncontextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level\nfeatures. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the\noriginal reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a\nfeature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation.

Such a swarm is required to operate in\ncomplex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent\ncommunication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known\nas Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing\ncapabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate\nexplicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in\nmaintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.\nRecent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the\nclassical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep\nlearning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent\nswarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric\nfeatures extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It\nincorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,\ndifferentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that\npromotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph\nLaplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent\ngathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must\ngather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing\nanalytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while\nmaintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes.

However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still\nface challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences\nbetween regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations\ncaused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the\ncounting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose\nDSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature\ncorrelation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and\na Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it\ncaptures the potential feature correlations in density variations and\nrepresentation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction\nmodule that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a\ndensity-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch\nestablishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global\nrepresentation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to\nthe two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,\nwhich enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve\ncounting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios.

When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe\nabove an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods\nattempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or\ntest-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than\nimposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these\nobjectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce\nLearn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for\ntest-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to\ntrain a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the\ndiffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a\nlearned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a\nsurprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces\nrather than learning true spatial patterns.

However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios\nusing Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and\nperformance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by\na distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation\nof low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing\ncatastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that\nstabilizes multi-turn TIR training.

However, the labeling process, especially for\nordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is\nprone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the\nperformance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions\n(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.\nFor instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean\nabsolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to\n0.49.

Traditional data-driven approaches, such as\nconvolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological\ninformation about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate\ninformation exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning\nhydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction\nmodels collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training\nexplodes with graph size and higher resolution.

We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial\nUnderstanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of\nspatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the\nupper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial\nimagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient\nto achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we\nfind that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding\nwithin the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and\nnative MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future\nimprovements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.\nThese insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new\ndirections for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling\nand architectural tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMulSeT\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9MLLMs\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u6216\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7MulSeT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0a\u9650\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u6539\u8fdbMLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance.

In\nthis situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI\nmodalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,\nsuffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data\nheterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI\nimage segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves\nmultiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It\ndistinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and\ncross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel\nmodality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework\n(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality\ndecoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the\nmodality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored\nand modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,\ncorresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,\nrespectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of\nheterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the\nmodality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes\ndynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for\nincomplete modalities in each local client.
