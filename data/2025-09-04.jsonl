While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that\nunder certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which\nwe refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges.

Existing solutions address this by\ncontinuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point\nfeatures, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation.

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches."}

Unlike other adaptive variants of\nMuon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be\ninterpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to\nthe optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past\ngradient norms.

This paper introduces\nHyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a\ndata-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into\nanomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three\ninnovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time\nalerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while\npreserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the\nhierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.\nEmpirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that\nHyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a\nPR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation\nstudies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic\nembedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,\nwith the full framework delivering the highest performance.

To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy\nregularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including\nPPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks."}

Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop\nclassification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many\nregions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address\nperformance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote\nsensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes\nstrategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a\nglobal crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries\nacross five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,\nsoybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,\nCropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,\nand cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal\nmulti-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic\ncoefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization\nunder spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and\nrobust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal\ndata augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that\nsimulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median\ntemporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance\nacross all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,\nparticularly when training data diversity is limited.

However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations.
