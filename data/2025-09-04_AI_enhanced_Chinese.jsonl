We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order.

We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a\nlearning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently\nout-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation\ntask in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data\nfrom the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset.

Robots\ncannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot\nreadily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a\ndifferent set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their\nscene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the\nrobots to perform alternate work tasks.

Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment\nassumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic\nSLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic\nfeatures, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point\nfeatures for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by\ncontinuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point\nfeatures, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation.

For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,\nthe joint torques are reduced up to 84\\% for the balanced configuration.\nExperimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable\nfor applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction\nforces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ed\u73af\u5e73\u9762\u4e94\u6746\u94fe\u7684\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec2-DOF\u7684Forbal-2\u548c5-DOF\u7684Forbal-5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u529b\u77e9\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u8282\u529b\u77e9\u548c\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b/\u529b\u77e9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u7f6e\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u77e9\u51cf\u5c1166%\uff0c\u5173\u8282\u529b\u77e9\u51cf\u5c1179-84%\uff0cForbal-2\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u529b\u77e9\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

This\nbecomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation\ntasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot\ncontrol paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base\nnavigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as\nseparate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback\nmechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based\nvisualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were\nsystematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring\nintegrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a\nfeedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and\nperceived effort of the teleoperator.

This gap stems from the technical challenges\nand high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its\nperformance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely\ndue to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine\nspatial details.

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error.

Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding.

In addition, traditional static condition control makes it\ndifficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically\nevolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic\nconditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general\nframework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the\ndiffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the\ndiffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by\nthe same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their\nstatistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and\nreduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives\nof the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising\nprocess and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,\ndemonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and\nvisible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve\nthe best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

The proposed\nmethod enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding\nfeatures extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image\nwithout inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments\nconducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method\nconstitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u8138\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u7167\u7247\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u6076\u610f\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f15\u8d77\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u540e\u95e8\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u4eba\u8138\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Subsequently, boundary\nenhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the\nCoarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the\nfirst step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two\ndistinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine\nChange Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class\nActivation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the\nchange-occurring moment from coarse change moments.

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state.

To alleviate\nthis burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict\nmeaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only\ncount-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To\nachieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past\npredictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation\nbias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to\nprovide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of\npredicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling\nlocations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with\nthe number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further\nenhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised\ncontrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations\nwithin crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\ncross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several\ndatasets.

We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors\nfor poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:\na patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a\npositive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion\nof the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical\napplicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized\npoisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual\nindustrial inspection domain.

In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),\nTabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an\norder-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical\nparameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target\nparameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative\ncomputation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time\ninference.

If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive\nattribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as\nfollows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function\nthat is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on\nthe weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)\nThe second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function\nin y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the\nobjective, but part of a constraint.

We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a\ncritical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight\nMLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff08long CoT\uff09\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u7eedRL\u9636\u6bb5\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u524d\u63d0\u3002"}}

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise \\textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}\ntechniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a\nnovel calculus, called \\textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation\ntransformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}. The abstract\nnature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of\ndiverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as\nwell as informal notations.

This has been\ndiscussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and\nmutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be\nwritten as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs\nand its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the\nidempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the\nLLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been\nlimited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two\nhypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to\nrecover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending\ntherefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.\nEspecially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the\nconstraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple\nhypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio\ntransformed likelihood function.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning\nbeyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing\ncomprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation.

This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask.

Investigation beyond Hallucination", "comment": "Website at https://llm-liar.github.io/", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across\na variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications\nraises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional\nfalsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM\nknowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior\nof LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical\nscenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the\nneural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal\ninterventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control\ndeceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce\nbehavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying\ntendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task\nperformance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal\noptimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,\nshedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in\nhigh-stakes environments.
