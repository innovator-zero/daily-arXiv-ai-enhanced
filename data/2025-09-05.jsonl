Here, we present a physics-inspired\ncooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the\ndissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a\ndecentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous\nformation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of\nexplicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended\npayload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to\nenergy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control\nsystem is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors\nof the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches\nunder the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and\npayload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying\nrobots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success\nrate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,\nand 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor\nwinds up to Beaufort scale 4.

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors.

In particular, they can spuriously separate connected\ncomponents of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in\nwell-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE\nalgorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm\nstochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that\nemphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR\ndistance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of\ndatasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data\nthat demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of\nEmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much\nless likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data.

Although conducting every candidate test\nfor a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only\na subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial\ninformation. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem\ncould be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In\npractice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects\nare tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can\nbias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic\nMDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as\n$\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ rate in\nepisodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness.

However, their potential is often limited by the\nfinite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To\ndevelop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale\nin complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we\nreframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a\ngoal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a\ngenerative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize\nincreasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**\nagents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,\ngoal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,\nconfigurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'\nweaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative\npolicy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics.

Project website:\n  https://mhtippur.github.io/inairclothmanipulation/", "summary": "Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable\nmaterial dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten\ngarments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm\nvisuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual\ncorrespondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on\ncrumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a\ncustom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that\ncaptures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.\nThese estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies\nbased on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance\nnetwork, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines\nwhich regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used\nduring execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in\nlow-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air\nconfigurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in\nfolding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable\nintermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting\ngrasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more\ngeneralizable and scalable garment manipulation."}

Despite their\nunique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective\nimages in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,\nmaking it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This\nsurvey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on\nthe perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging\npipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for\nanalyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of\ndomain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform\nsampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.\nBuilding on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300\nresearch papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method\nanalysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific\nchallenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task\ncomparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual\nquality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal\nunderstanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges\nand future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the\nadvancement of panoramic vision research.
