### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用特征预测框架（GFP），通过预测高级特征而非低级别重建，提高了骨架动作识别的效率和语义表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于原始关节坐标的重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限。

Method: 采用协作学习框架，动态生成多样化的监督信号，并结合约束优化确保特征多样性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了计算效率（训练速度提升6.2倍）和表示质量的显著提升，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测，显著提升了骨架动作识别的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

### [2] [Teacher-Student Model for Detecting and Classifying Mitosis in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03614)
*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Dimitri Androutsos,Susan Done,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于UNet分割框架的师生模型，用于解决有丝分裂检测和分类任务，同时通过域泛化模块提升模型对域偏移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家手动计数有丝分裂耗时且存在观察者间差异，AI工具虽能自动检测但易受域偏移和数据不平衡影响。

Method: 采用UNet分割框架，结合对比表示学习和域对抗训练，师生模型生成伪掩码增强特征判别力。分类任务使用多尺度CNN分类器。

Result: 在初步测试集上，Track 1的F1得分为0.7660，Track 2的平衡准确率为0.8414。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一分割和分类框架，提升了有丝分裂分析的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过识别和抑制多重重叠偏差，提升视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像中存在多种重叠偏差，单独处理效果不佳，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 采用ABIL识别偏差，并通过梯度抑制微调去除偏差，引入SBA度量偏差放大。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，显著提升最差组准确率，降低多属性偏差放大。

Conclusion: GMBM是首个实用的端到端多偏差视觉识别解决方案。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量化的U-Net模型，通过消融研究优化了nnU-Net的关键组件，实现了与nnU-Net相当的左心室分割性能，同时模型更小、更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 左心室分割在超声心动图中对自动提取临床指标（如体积和射血分数）至关重要，但现有nnU-Net模型体积大、速度慢，限制了实时应用。

Method: 通过消融研究评估数据增强方案、架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术，确定最有效的组件，并设计轻量化的U-Net模型。

Result: 轻量化U-Net（2M参数）在CAMUS数据集上性能与nnU-Net（33M参数）相当（Dice分数0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89），且体积缩小16倍、速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明简单数据增强和深度监督是关键，复杂增强和大模型容量收益递减，轻量化模型在保持性能的同时更适合实时应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的无监督树实例分割算法treeX，适用于地面和无人机激光扫描数据，提高了运行速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，而treeX算法提供了一种资源高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合基于聚类的树干检测和区域生长的树冠划分，提供两种参数预设以适应不同扫描方式。

Result: 改进后的算法在多个公开数据集上表现优于原版和其他开源方法，F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 该算法可作为资源高效的替代方案，或用于生成深度学习模型的半自动标注。

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D是一种新型的3D场景理解框架，通过几何感知监督和双重监督范式显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本监督，缺乏几何约束，难以学习鲁棒的3D空间表示。

Method: Reg3D采用双重监督范式，结合对象级和帧级重建任务，通过双编码器架构强制几何一致性。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等数据集上表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了新的训练范式。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

### [7] [QuantV2X: A Fully Quantized Multi-Agent System for Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03704)
*Seth Z. Zhao,Huizhi Zhang,Zhaowei Li,Juntong Peng,Anthony Chui,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Hao Xiang,Zhiyu Huang,Fujia Wang,Ran Tian,Chenfeng Xu,Bolei Zhou,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X是一种完全量化的多模态多智能体V2X协同感知系统，通过统一的端到端量化策略显著降低了计算和传输成本，同时保持了与全精度系统相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注准确性而忽略了效率、延迟和实际部署性，且依赖高计算和传输成本的全精度模型，不适用于资源受限环境。

Method: 提出QuantV2X，采用统一的端到端量化策略，对神经网络模型和传输消息表示进行量化。

Result: QuantV2X在低比特约束下实现了与全精度系统相当的准确性，系统级延迟降低了3.2倍，mAP30提高了9.5。

Conclusion: QuantV2X证明了完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中的可行性，并提供了开源实现以推动研究。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ResNet50、MobileNetV2和EfficientNetB0三种深度学习架构在基于叶片脉络模式的植物物种自动分类中的效果，发现EfficientNetB0表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶片脉络模式是植物分类的重要形态特征，研究旨在开发高效、自动化的植物分类工具。

Method: 使用包含15种植物物种的瑞典叶片数据集（共1,125张图像），评估三种模型在训练和测试阶段的性能指标。

Result: ResNet50训练准确率94.11%但过拟合；MobileNetV2测试准确率93.34%，泛化能力更强；EfficientNetB0测试准确率94.67%，表现最优。

Conclusion: EfficientNetB0在基于脉络特征的植物分类中表现出色，适合开发可扩展且准确的自动化分类工具。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种更高效的图匹配方法，通过推迟跨图节点级交互到联合嵌入架构的末尾，显著提高了速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间较慢，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点级嵌入的距离函数，推迟跨图节点级交互。

Result: LayoutGKN在计算相似性方面表现与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度。

Conclusion: LayoutGKN是一种高效且性能优越的图匹配方法，适用于建筑布局图的比较。

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种基于奇异值分解（SVD）的多模态参数高效适应技术，用于改进CLIP模型在细粒度领域的适应能力，仅需调整0.04%的参数即可实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程或全模型微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识，CLIP-SVD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过SVD调整CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值，重新缩放基向量以适应新领域，无需注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上实现最优分类性能，并在少样本设置下表现更优。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD在保持模型泛化能力的同时，显著提升了适应性能，且具有可解释性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合训练无关的神经架构搜索方法和形状-纹理注意力模块（STAM）的轻量级网络STA-Net，用于边缘设备上的植物病害诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级网络在捕捉植物病害细微特征（如不规则病变形状和复杂纹理）上的不足。

Method: 1. 使用DeepMAD方法设计高效网络骨干；2. 引入STAM模块，通过可变形卷积和Gabor滤波器分别捕捉形状和纹理特征。

Result: 在CCMT数据集上达到89.00%准确率和88.96% F1分数，参数量仅401K，计算量51.1M FLOPs。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制结合领域知识，为边缘设备上的精准农业AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

### [12] [SLENet: A Guidance-Enhanced Network for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03786)
*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了DeepCamo数据集和SLENet框架，用于水下伪装物体检测（UCOD），并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装物体检测对海洋生态至关重要，但受光学失真、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特征影响，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-不对称增强模块（GAE）和定位引导分支（LGB），结合多尺度监督解码器（MSSD）提升检测精度。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上，SLENet表现优于现有方法，并展示了对广泛COD任务的高泛化性。

Conclusion: SLENet为水下伪装物体检测提供了有效解决方案，并在实验中验证了其优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [13] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视频帧时间偏置改进扩散模型训练的方法，无需架构修改即可加速收敛并提高生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图像训练扩散模型存在信息不足的问题，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和泛化能力降低。

Method: 利用连续视频帧中的时间偏置进行训练，无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在HandCo数据集上，收敛速度提升2倍以上，训练和验证分布的FID降低，生成多样性提高。

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少梯度方差加速收敛，有效捕捉时间变化，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

### [14] [MedVista3D: Vision-Language Modeling for Reducing Diagnostic Errors in 3D CT Disease Detection, Understanding and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03800)
*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个多尺度语义增强的视觉语言预训练框架，用于3D CT分析，解决了现有模型在局部-全局理解和报告语言一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断中的错误（如漏读、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中普遍存在，尤其是在3D成像中，需要同时满足局部检测、全局推理和语义一致的语言报告。

Method: MedVista3D通过局部和全局图像-文本对齐进行细粒度表示学习，并引入语言模型重写和放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答中达到最先进性能，并能迁移到器官分割和预后预测任务。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过多尺度语义增强和语言一致性处理，显著提升了3D CT分析的性能，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化文本提示学习方法（CaPL），显著提升了CLIP在细粒度数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP提示学习方法在细粒度数据集上表现有限，需改进。

Method: 通过视觉粒度化技术构建视觉颗粒，结合属性解耦模块和颗粒学习模块，利用因果推理策略提升文本提示的判别性。

Result: 在15个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在细粒度数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: CaPL方法通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，有效提升了CLIP在细粒度任务中的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于事件相机的高效湍流消除方法EGTM，通过事件流揭示湍流与时空分布的关联，显著提升了计算效率和恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要高容量网络处理同步帧的粗粒度湍流动态，计算和存储效率低。事件相机的高时间分辨率有望解决这一问题。

Method: 提出'event-lucky insight'揭示湍流与事件流的关联，并设计EGTM框架，从事件流中提取像素级无湍流引导信息进行融合。

Result: EGTM在模型大小、推理延迟和复杂度上分别比现有方法提升710倍、214倍和224倍，恢复质量（PSNR和SSIM）也达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 事件相机的引入显著提升了湍流消除任务的效率和质量，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合多模态特征，提升了RGB-Event检测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理RGB和Event数据的低信息区域时计算冗余且性能不佳，需要更智能的特征选择与融合策略。

Method: 提出Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS)策略和Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF)模块，自适应丢弃低信息区域并高效融合互补特征。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上表现优于现有方法，兼具高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应稀疏化和高效融合，显著提升了多模态检测的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLO的集成模型，结合可见光和热成像数据，显著提高了风电场缺陷检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机搭载先进传感器为风电场监测提供了新机会，但高分辨率数据和高效处理方法是可靠缺陷检测的关键。

Method: 开发了集成YOLOv8通用模型和专用热成像模型的集成方法，采用复杂边界框融合算法结合预测结果。

Result: 实验显示该方法mAP@.5达0.93，F1分数0.90，优于单独YOLOv8模型的0.91 mAP@.5。

Conclusion: 结合多YOLO架构和融合多光谱数据提供了更可靠的解决方案，提升了视觉和热缺陷的检测能力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有食物识别方法难以应对新菜品的快速涌现，组合零样本学习（CZSL）中的属性和对象与食物中的菜系和食材自然对应，但CZSFR面临背景冗余、角色混淆和语义偏差三大挑战。

Method: 提出SalientFusion方法，包含SalientFormer（去除背景冗余并利用深度特征解决角色混淆）和DebiasAT（通过对齐提示与视觉特征减少语义偏差）。

Result: 在提出的CZSFood-90和CZSFood-164基准数据集上，SalientFusion取得了最先进的结果，并在通用CZSL数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SalientFusion通过上下文感知方法有效解决了CZSFR的三大挑战，为食物识别领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自回归的方法在长期占用生成中存在效率低、时间退化和缺乏可控性的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将占用世界模型重新定义为时间尺度预测任务（TENS），并引入TensFormer管理时空关系，同时提出姿态聚合策略增强可控性。

Result: 实验表明，OccTENS在占用质量和推理速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间尺度预测和姿态控制策略，实现了高效、可控的高质量占用生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系时，物体的功能（即对其他物体的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的物体部分通常在形状和外观上相似。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型伪标记多视角图像获取功能部分，结合密集对比学习从像素对应中提取功能和空间知识，训练新模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优于现有的自监督图像表示和基于视觉语言模型的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过功能引导的密集对应方法，能够有效解决跨类别图像匹配问题，为形状重建和机器人操作等任务提供支持。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter通过动态适应少样本数据，显著提升了CLIP的性能和效率。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling

TL;DR: SPECS是一种针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过增强CLIP的特定性来提高评估效果，同时保持高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标在长图像描述任务中不可靠，N-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，RS指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽相关性强但成本过高。

Method: SPECS通过修改CLIP的目标函数，强调特定性，奖励正确细节并惩罚错误细节。

Result: SPECS在相关性上与开源LLM指标相当，但效率更高。

Conclusion: SPECS是图像描述模型开发中迭代评估的实用替代方案。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

Conclusion: LMVC框架在多视角视频编码中表现出色，为未来研究提供了强有力的基准。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性，TopoSculpt旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略、拓扑完整性Betti约束和渐进式细化方案。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，几何和拓扑错误显著减少，分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效纠正关键拓扑错误，推动复杂3D管状结构的高保真建模。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应负文本空间（ANTS）方法，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）提升OOD检测性能，显著降低FPR95。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对OOD图像理解不足，且存在假负标签问题，影响近OOD检测性能。

Method: 通过MLLMs生成负标签，分别针对远OOD和近OOD设计自适应负文本空间，并采用加权评分平衡两者。

Result: 在ImageNet基准上，FPR95降低4.2%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: ANTS方法无需训练且零样本，具有高适应性和扩展性。

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: MMChange是一种结合图像和文本模态的多模态遥感变化检测方法，通过增强特征表示和语义建模提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖图像模态，限制了特征表示和变化模式建模，尤其在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 引入图像特征细化模块（IFR）、视觉语言模型（VLM）生成语义描述、文本差异增强模块（TDE）和图像文本特征融合模块（ITFF）。

Result: 在多个数据集（LEVIRCD、WHUCD、SYSUCD）上超越现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MMChange通过多模态融合显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，结合位置编码和全实例相关性计算，性能优越且易于部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间关系建模和序列长度外推问题，同时避免Transformer方法的复杂部署需求。

Method: 采用位置编码模块处理空间关系，SAC块基于MLP实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算。

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL高效且易于部署，为WSI分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Result: 辅助数据显著提升了分割准确性，尤其在标注数据较少时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 辅助成像模态可增强模型性能，即使仅在训练时可用。

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多项选择题回答（MCQA）中提示设计的敏感性，发现微小变化可导致15%的准确率差异，并提出了Promptception框架和针对不同模型的提示原则。

Motivation: 揭示LMMs在MCQA任务中提示设计的敏感性，解决透明和公平评估的挑战。

Method: 提出Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型，评估10种LMMs在3个MCQA基准上的表现。

Result: 专有模型对提示措辞更敏感，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂措辞能力较弱。

Conclusion: 提出了针对专有和开源LMMs的提示原则，以支持更鲁棒和公平的评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理体素特征时忽视高度轴信息，且传统通道注意力对所有高度层赋予相同权重，限制了特征表达能力。

Method: 采用全局和局部垂直切片提取体素特征，结合全局局部融合模块和SEAttention3D模块动态分配通道注意力。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上显著提升平均IoU，尤其在小物体类别上表现突出。

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架有效解决了高度轴信息处理问题，提升了3D语义占用预测性能。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Conclusion: 呼吁在研究中谨慎使用包含虚假信号的图像，并通过乳腺癌分类案例验证了方法的实用性。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: LML问题在病理图像分割、政治投票预测等应用中具有重要价值，但现有MIL方法难以直接解决。

Method: 提出计数网络估计多数标签，并通过MPEM增强多数类比例。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在四个数据集上优于传统MIL方法，且各模块均有效。

Conclusion: LML是一种有价值的问题，提出的方法在性能和应用上均表现出色。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Result: 系统在1920*1080分辨率视频流中实现50-100毫秒的单帧处理延迟，多尺度目标识别精度超过98.5%。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Conclusion: KWF方法有效解决了视角偏差问题，提升了行人重识别的性能，且适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Result: 在两个基准数据集（LLP和UnAV-100）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结合两种研究方向的优势，有效提升了AVVP任务的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing

Motivation: 现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染上表现不佳，导致故事不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述和对话，结合注意力机制和自注意力机制确保角色一致性和对象精确放置。

Result: 实验表明TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion解决了多角色故事生成中的一致性和对话分配问题。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，需改进以提升实用性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

*Safouane El Ghazouali,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisioFirm是一个开源Web应用，通过AI辅助自动化简化图像标注，减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注工具需要大量人工输入，难以扩展到大数据集。

Method: 结合CLIP、预训练检测器和零样本模型生成初始标注，用户可通过交互工具进行修正。

Result: 在COCO类数据集上测试，初始预测大多正确，手动工作量减少90%。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过自动化显著提升标注效率，同时保持高准确性。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理跨域图像检索时，对象特征常与域特定风格纠缠，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型解缠对象特征与域特定风格，并通过渐进式对齐互邻居实现特征对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上超过13个域，DUDE取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进对齐，显著提升了无监督跨域图像检索的效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

*Wanfu Wang,Qipeng Huang,Guangquan Xue,Xiaobo Liang,Juntao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER是一个自进化框架，通过多步感知能力提升VLMs在GUI任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在高分辨率输入和复杂视觉交互中有效推理的问题。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛质量估计和IoU区域质量评估，构建高质量偏好数据。

Result: 在ScreenSpot Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中表现优异，GTA1-7B上达到55.7分。

Conclusion: LASER在7B规模模型中实现了新的SoTA性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像分割在测绘、城市规划等领域有重要应用，但现有分割网络未针对其独特挑战（如尺度变化）优化。

Method: 通过直接输入和混合架构两种方式，将DMP特征融入三种先进分割网络，并在iSAID数据集上评估。

Result: 混合DMP架构在mIoU、F1和Recall指标上优于非DMP模型。

Conclusion: DMP的引入能有效提升遥感图像分割性能，混合架构表现最佳。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本引导的3D扩散模型，用于合成tau PET图像，结合结构MRI和血浆生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: tau PET成本高且可用性有限，而结构MRI和血浆生物标志物更易获取，因此需要一种非侵入性、经济高效的方法来量化tau病理。

Method: 使用文本引导的3D扩散模型，结合血浆p-tau217测量（文本提示）和MRI解剖结构约束，合成3D tau PET图像。

Result: 模型能够生成真实且具有临床意义的3D tau PET图像，适用于不同疾病阶段。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为tau PET数据增强的非侵入性替代方案，支持疾病进展模拟和可视化。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Result: 在标准基准和真实案例中，方法在弱输入假设下生成准确且详细的关节物体表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角和无相机监督下表现优于现有方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Conclusion: 该模型高效且性能优越，同时揭示了多模态大语言模型在视觉推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: GeoArena为图像地理定位任务提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架通过微调图像编辑模型（而非生成模型）进行密集几何预测，显著提升了单目深度和法线估计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，因此图像编辑模型可能比文本到图像生成模型更适合作为微调基础。

Method: FE2E基于Diffusion Transformer架构，通过重新设计损失函数（一致速度目标）和量化方法（对数量化），并利用全局注意力机制联合预测深度和法线。

Result: FE2E在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升，尤其在ETH3D数据集上性能增益超过35%，且优于训练数据量更大的DepthAnything系列。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型具有固有结构先验，更适合密集几何预测任务，FE2E框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Motivation: 动态面部表情识别面临长尾分布和时空特征建模复杂的挑战，现有方法未能有效解决这些问题。

Method: 提出GEIIM模块捕捉时空关系，WIAN动态加权聚合实例特征，MCCL策略平衡类别训练。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上达到最优性能，具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: MICACL通过多模块协同解决了DFER的核心问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法为紧急响应提供了实用的视觉总结工具。

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Result: 在主流AIC基准测试中显著优于传统方法和通用MLLMs，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM为AIC任务提供了一种有效的美学显著性集成方法。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Method: 结合扩散模型生成关键视角渲染图，通过跨视角注意力机制和实例级风格迁移实现风格化。

Result: 在多种场景下显著优于现有方法，生成更具结构性和视觉一致性的结果。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了风格迁移中的语义提取和结构清晰度问题，提升了3D场景的艺术表现力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtyINR是一种自监督框架，通过神经表示同时解决物体和探针恢复问题，显著提升了低信号条件下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线ptychography在纳米尺度分辨率方面表现优异，但探针未知时的图像重建问题限制了其广泛应用。传统方法和深度学习在低信号条件下效果不佳。

Method: 提出PtyINR框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需探针预表征。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均表现出卓越的重建质量，尤其在低信号条件下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR为计算显微镜中的探针依赖逆问题提供了通用且物理信息化的解决方案。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效且可扩展，为多模态安全数据集构建提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 图像导向方法在多模态安全数据集构建中具有潜力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的少步蒸馏方法在2D扩散模型中表现良好，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Velocity Matching（VM）和Velocity Distillation（VD）两个优化目标，分别从速度和分布层面等效转换优化目标。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变压器的采样步骤从25步减少到1或2步，实现了9.0倍和6.5倍的加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: MDT-dist显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，并在少步3D生成中实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Result: 在肖像动画属性迁移任务中达到最优性能，支持多属性组合。

Conclusion: Durian通过创新设计和训练策略，实现了高效、鲁棒的属性迁移，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字放射成像中，准直器阴影的检测是一个关键预处理步骤，但由于散射X射线辐射的干扰，阴影边缘可能变得模糊。利用准直器阴影通常为多边形形状的先验知识，可以改进检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度学习的分割方法，结合可微分的Hough变换网络来检测准直边界，并增强ROI中心信息的提取能力。在推理阶段，结合两个任务的信息生成线约束的分割掩码。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于最多四条阴影边界的准直器检测，且不受特定边数的限制，展示了在X射线图像预处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一模型（UM）的循环一致性评估框架UCF-UM，用于量化视觉语言模型在跨模态任务中的语义漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注单模态任务，无法衡量模型在跨模态任务中的一致性，因此需要一种新的评估协议。

Method: 引入UCF-UM框架，通过交替执行图像到文本（I2T）和文本到图像（T2I）任务，提出三种指标（MCD、SDR、MGG）量化语义漂移。

Result: 实验表明，不同模型在跨模态稳定性上差异显著，例如BAGEL表现稳定，而Vila-u漂移较快。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是现有单模态评估的必要补充，UCF-UM为统一模型的跨模态稳定性提供了实用指标。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Conclusion: 本文为全景视觉技术的发展提供了新的见解和前瞻性视角，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to

Conclusion: 联合训练和任务特定设计有效提升多模态虚假信息检测能力。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model

generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time
performance and scalability, improving simulation fidelity for underwater

Conclusion: INGRID通过结合机制理论和机器学习，使非专业研究人员也能设计并行机构，为机器人智能的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and

Conclusion: 密集描述符为其他规划模式提供了可重用的中间表示，为更通用和可扩展的衣物操作铺平了道路。

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

TL;DR: 设计了一种基于多模态测量融合的4WIS4WID爬墙机器人姿态估计器，结合EKF和UKF算法，解决了复杂环境下传统传感器失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爬墙机器人需要精确的姿态估计以携带测量设备，但传统传感器（如激光、超声波、雷达）和GPS在建筑环境中不可靠，因此依赖机器人里程计。

Method: 融合轮式里程计、视觉里程计和IMU数据，使用EKF和UKF进行姿态估计；采用非线性优化和Levenberg-Marquardt方法校准系统参数，遗传算法和粒子群优化校准运动学参数。

Result: 通过实验验证了校准方法和姿态估计器的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合方法有效解决了爬墙机器人在复杂环境中的姿态估计问题。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Conclusion: FPC-VLA通过关键帧激活监督器，显著提升任务成功率，展示了强大的泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel
communication concept for efficiently transmitting integrated wheel sensor data
from an ESP32 microcontroller. Our proposed approach utilizes a
publish-subscribe system, surpassing comparable solutions in the literature
regarding data transmission volume. We tested this approach on a drum tire test
rig with our prototype sensors system utilizing a diverse selection of sample
frequencies between 1 Hz and 32 000 Hz to demonstrate the efficacy of our
communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data
loss, approximately 0.1 % of the sampled data, validating the reliability of
our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel
sensor communication.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在复杂任务中动作准确性不足，主要依赖模仿学习的后训练范式，缺乏对数据质量分布特性的深入理解。

Method: 提出离线RL后训练目标，引入自适应调整的缩放因子，构建偏差-方差权衡目标函数，控制RL信号对流损失的影响。

Result: ARFM在仿真和真实实验中表现出优异的泛化性、鲁棒性、少样本学习和持续学习性能。

Conclusion: ARFM通过自适应平衡RL优势保留和流损失梯度方差控制，实现了更稳定高效的微调过程。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Conclusion: DRLR框架在减少引导误差、提高探索效率和跨任务鲁棒性方面表现优异，适用于实际工业机器人任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Conclusion: 即使不使用点云编码，模型仍能高效运行，且性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Conclusion: LASEM框架在计算效率高的同时，适用于非均匀几何形状、任意电缆布线、分布式载荷和轴向可扩展性，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with

categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision

environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make

increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data

Method: 提出EMMA框架，结合人类全身运动数据和静态机器人数据进行端到端训练。

Result: 在三个真实任务中，EMMA表现与基于遥操作数据的基线（Mobile ALOHA）相当或更优，并能泛化到新场景。

Conclusion: EMMA为真实环境中的可扩展机器人学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Scaling mobile manipulation imitation learning is bottlenecked by expensive
mobile robot teleoperation. We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA),
an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile
manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To
accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot
data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates
comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data
(Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task
success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations
and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the
hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in
real-world environments. Details of this project can be found at

### [91] [The Optimiser Hidden in Plain Sight: Training with the Loss Landscape's Induced Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03594)
*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼度量的新型优化器，用于训练神经网络，在低维任务中表现优异，并在高维任务中略优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用损失函数在高维空间中的黎曼度量，从几何角度开发更有效的优化器。

Method: 基于黎曼度量设计优化器，并与SGD、Adam等方法进行比较。

Result: 在低维任务中表现优异，高维任务中略有提升，且具有理论优势。

Conclusion: 新型优化器在计算复杂度与Adam相当的情况下，提供了更好的性能。

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT是一种通用的EHR基础模型，整合了特征表示、零样本预测和合成数据生成功能，通过时间标记学习框架提升临床序列的时序推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型多为单一任务设计，限制了其在真实医疗场景中的通用性和实用性。

Method: 采用时间标记学习框架，显式编码患者动态时间线，支持时序推理。

Result: CEHR-GPT在三个任务中表现优异，并能通过词汇扩展和微调适应外部数据集。

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT的通用性使其能快速开发模型、发现队列和预测患者结果，无需任务特定训练。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

TL;DR: NMF与PCC的相互关系及其在图像数据处理中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非负矩阵分解（NMF）与共同原因原则（PCC）之间的关系，并利用这种关系改进数据降维和去噪。

Method: 通过将灰度图像数据映射到概率模型，利用PCC估计NMF的有效秩，并基于NMF实现PCC的近似方法。

Result: 提出的秩估计方法对噪声和局部优化种子具有稳定性，解决了NMF的非可识别性问题，并实现了数据聚类和去噪。

Conclusion: NMF与PCC的结合为数据降维和去噪提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物联网场景中，联邦学习面临数据异构性、客户端能量和可用性限制的挑战，需有效选择参与训练的客户端以保证全局模型收敛和贡献平衡。

Method: 提出FedDeCAB方法，利用概率排名选择客户端，并在客户端离线时从邻近客户端获取部分模型参数进行联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，FedDeCAB在高度异构数据分布、有限通信预算和动态客户端离线/重新加入情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: FedDeCAB通过半去中心化设计和邻居协作机制，有效提升了联邦学习在复杂场景中的性能和通信效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF方法无法捕捉群体多样性，MaxMin-RLHF虽改进但仍存在少数群体表现不佳的问题。

Method: SharedRep-RLHF通过学习群体间的共享特征，而非单独建模，优化了奖励模型。

Result: 实验证明SharedRep-RLHF在多种自然语言任务中优于MaxMin-RLHF，性能提升最高达20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF通过共享特征学习，有效解决了群体多样性问题，提升了公平性和性能。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Motivation: 解决供应链中的效率损失、融资约束和风险传导问题，推动高质量供应链发展。

Method: 结合交易成本与信息不对称理论，使用随机森林、LSTM、XGBoost等算法处理多维数据，构建成本-效率-风险分析框架，并应用核心企业信用赋能与动态质押融资模型。

Result: 验证结果显示库存周转率提升30%，中小企业融资成本降低18%-22%，订单履约率稳定在95%以上，需求预测误差≤8%，信用评估准确率≥90%。

Conclusion: SCM-FSCM模型有效降低运营成本，缓解融资约束，支持高质量供应链发展。

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Method: 通过分析梯度方差和标准差的变化，提出一种梯度归一化方法，使其与梯度的自然演化对齐。

Result: 在CIFAR-100基准测试中，ResNet和VGG模型上表现优异，保持或提升了测试准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了直接跟踪梯度动态的重要性，为未来优化研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Conclusion: HF-FMs为解决边缘网络中的异构性问题提供了新思路，并开辟了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

Motivation: 现有SNE算法（如UMAP和tSNE）在噪声和高维数据中无法保持几何结构，可能导致虚假分离或聚类失败。

Method: 提出EmbedOR算法，采用曲率增强的距离度量，强调底层聚类结构，并扩展了tSNE的一致性结果。

Result: 实验表明EmbedOR能更好地保持数据几何结构，减少高密度区域的碎片化，并能用于注释现有可视化。

Conclusion: EmbedOR在可视化质量和几何保持方面优于现有方法，并提供更深入的数据几何洞察。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

Conclusion: 揭示了缺失数据对学习的影响，为高效序列测试策略设计提供指导。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经算子的表示特性，尽管其在科学计算中日益重要，但其表示性质仍未充分研究。

Method: 比较了SAE、提升SAE和SAE神经算子的推理和训练动态，分析了提升和算子模块引入的归纳偏差。

Result: 提升和算子模块带来了更快的恢复速度、平滑概念的更好恢复以及跨分辨率鲁棒推理的独特优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经算子的机制解释提供了新工具，并展示了其在科学计算中的潜力。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SatML应用中标记训练数据稀疏且分布不均，现有研究多关注模型架构而非数据条件建模，导致大规模监测时数据收集策略不明确。

Method: 提出了首个空间训练数据优化问题框架，结合异构数据收集成本和预算约束，并开发了新的优化方法。

Result: 在三大洲四个任务的实验中，优化采样策略显著提升了性能，并明确了优化采样的适用场景。

Conclusion: 该框架和方法可推广至SatML各领域，特别适用于农业调查数据增强，已在多哥的农业监测中应用。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Result: 在稀疏CT重建等实验中，方法在准确性和效率上优于传统前馈神经网络和插值方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维流形上的函数逼近提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 传统手工训练环境的有限复杂性和隐含偏差限制了世界模型的潜力，需要能随智能体学习而动态扩展复杂性的环境。

Method: 设计了一个生成型攻击者智能体和一个合作型防御者团队，攻击者通过生成挑战性世界状态来利用防御者弱点，防御者则学习应对策略。

Result: 该方法促生了复杂行为，如攻击者生成侧翼和掩护阵型，防御者学习协调集火和分散战术。

Conclusion: 对抗性共进化是学习驱动智能体战略深度和鲁棒性的世界模型的有效方法。

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

Result: 在100个领域中验证，PAMC样本效率提升1.6-2.1倍，计算开销仅增加20%。

Conclusion: 结构奖励学习成为新范式，适用于机器人、医疗等高样本成本领域。

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

Motivation: 时间序列预测在在线部署中面临分布偏移的挑战，现有方法主要关注参数选择和更新策略，但作者认为潜在因素的变化是根本原因。

Method: 提出ADAPT-Z方法，利用适配器模块结合当前特征表示和历史梯度信息，实现延迟反馈下的鲁棒参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，ADAPT-Z在多个数据集上优于无适应性的基准模型和现有在线学习方法。

Conclusion: ADAPT-Z通过更新潜在因素的表示，有效解决了时间序列预测中的分布偏移和延迟反馈问题。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

Result: 基于树的集成模型在准确性和鲁棒性上表现最佳，LiDAR特征有效捕捉粗糙度效应。

Conclusion: 框架支持生成散射感知环境地图，提升下一代网络的连接可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

Result: 实验表明，鲁棒分区在社区追踪场景中能更准确地恢复真实社区。

Conclusion: CPM模型在博弈论框架下表现出高效、鲁棒和准确的特点，适用于社区检测任务。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的BEV注入框架，通过融合多模态数据和空间上下文，显著提升了V2I链路预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆传感器数据的增加促使利用MLLMs进行链路质量预测，但MLLMs缺乏空间理解能力，需解决此问题。

Method: 开发了BEV注入连接器，结合CARLA和MATLAB的共仿真环境生成多模态数据，并提取指令和真实响应。

Result: 在三个V2I任务中，BEV注入框架将准确率提升至13.9%，在恶劣条件下提升至32.7%。

Conclusion: BEV注入框架显著提升了链路预测性能，尤其在复杂环境中表现稳健。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理异构任务，扩展了MFG中IRL的应用范围。

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

Conclusion: 自动选择DA策略的方法兼容性强，能有效提升低比特模型的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding

We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the mistake-bound model of online learning with caps on the
number of arithmetic operations per round. We prove general bounds on the
minimum number of arithmetic operations per round that are necessary to learn
an arbitrary family of functions with finitely many mistakes. We solve a
problem on agnostic mistake-bounded online learning with bandit feedback from
(Filmus et al, 2024) and (Geneson \& Tang, 2024). We also extend this result to
the setting of operation caps.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于混合AI的卫星故障检测系统，通过形式化验证工具Marabou确保神经网络模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星组件故障修复成本高且复杂，早期故障检测可减少资源消耗。

Method: 使用形式化验证工具Marabou验证神经网络模型的局部鲁棒性。

Result: 量化模型输入扰动对输出的影响，提升模型在不确定性下的可信度。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提高卫星故障检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型在医疗应用中表现优异，但可能无法捕捉临床所需的模式，例如非单调关系。论文旨在解决这种不一致性。

Method: 通过调查收集临床知识，将其作为约束整合到机器学习模型中，并在前列腺癌预测案例中分析模型性能和行为。

Result: 研究表明，通过约束整合临床知识可以实现模型与临床学习的对齐，且不影响性能。进一步实验表明，模型预测差异越大，临床解释差异越明显。

Conclusion: 论文证明了在非生成式AI临床风险预测模型中，通过反馈驱动的方法实现模型与临床学习对齐的可行性。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异质性和类别不平衡问题影响了全局模型的泛化能力，需要一种新方法来优化特征表示。

Method: FedQuad通过最小化类内距离和最大化类间距离，在共享特征空间中解耦客户端数据。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，FedQuad在不同数据分布和多客户端场景下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedQuad通过度量学习策略有效解决了联邦学习中的表示学习挑战，为数据异质性提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

Motivation: 现有CCI方法在治疗不平衡时预测区间过于保守，需改进。

Method: 引入合成数据增强校准集，结合RCPS和PPI进行去偏。

Result: SP-CCI在多个数据集上显著减少区间宽度，保持覆盖。

Conclusion: SP-CCI有效提升预测区间效率，理论保证其有效性。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，MISOB能减少所有群体的社会负担，同时保持分类器的整体准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为算法追索中的公平性问题提供了理论支持，并通过MISOB算法展示了实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: 代理工作流和LLMs在数据生成中潜力巨大，为未来方法指明新方向。

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

Motivation: 传统注意力机制直接比较查询和键，缺乏对输入序列动态特性的建模。

Method: 将输入序列建模为线性随机微分方程的离散观测，利用闭式解高效传播不确定性，注意力权重通过最大似然解生成。

Result: AFA在计算和内存复杂度上与标准注意力相当，且在动态和噪声消失时退化为普通点积注意力。

Conclusion: AFA提供了一种更高效的注意力机制，同时保留了传统注意力的优点。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Conclusion: 自监督语音学习为生物声学研究提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Motivation: 探索时间序列预测模型中成员推断攻击的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出了两种攻击方法：改进的多变量LiRA和新型端到端学习攻击DTS，并在真实数据集上评估。

Result: 预测模型易受攻击，用户级攻击效果显著，且攻击效果随预测时间增长和训练数据减少而增强。

Conclusion: 研究为时间序列预测模型的隐私风险评估提供了新基线，揭示了其脆弱性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

Conclusion: 通过谱条件和实验验证，为GNN中过平滑问题提供了理论支持和实用解决方案。

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral

decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在推理阶段计算和内存成本高，限制了实际部署。

Result: 在 Llama-3.1 8B 和 Qwen-3 8B 上，SBD 实现了 3-5 倍的前向传递减少，性能不变。

Conclusion: SBD 是一种无需架构修改或额外训练的高效加速方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）各有优势，但缺乏统一框架整合其互补能力。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval基准测试中表现优异，且效率接近单一模型。

Conclusion: ZooCast为多模型动态协作提供了高效解决方案，支持渐进式扩展。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: 该方法使降维过程更快、更可靠，并能确定预期结构是否被捕获。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

Conclusion: 结合注意力机制的灵活性和SSM的计算效率，提出新方法并证明其稳定性。

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Conclusion: 框架为设计自适应噪声注入方案提供理论指导，并揭示了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的多目标优化方法，用于解决差分隐私中隐私与模型性能的权衡问题，通过直接建模帕累托前沿和改进偏好学习方式，显著减少了计算成本和用户交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）在隐私保护分析中引入了隐私保证与模型性能之间的权衡，现有方法未能充分利用问题的独特结构，导致效率低下。

Method: 通过理论推导帕累托前沿的形状，直接建模前沿；改进偏好学习方式，用假设的权衡曲线替代简单的成对比较。

Result: 在差分隐私逻辑回归和深度迁移学习的实验中，该方法以更少的计算成本和用户交互收敛到最优权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了效率，为差分隐私中的权衡问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

Method: AT-UCB结合因果抽象理论在低成本模拟的粗粒度CMAB中探索，再在目标CMAB中使用UCB算法限制动作集。

Result: 理论证明和流行病学模拟实验表明，AT-UCB相比传统UCB显著减少累积遗憾。

Conclusion: AT-UCB为多抽象层次CMAB问题提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

Motivation: 私人汽车拥有量的快速增长加剧了城市停车问题，需要准确有效的停车位可用性预测来支持城市规划和管理。

Method: 使用K-means聚类建立停车集群区域（PCZs），整合多源交通需求数据，并改进iTransformer模型，引入自监督时空表示学习和双分支注意力机制。

Result: 在成都的真实数据实验中，SST-iTransformer表现优于基线模型，实现了最低的均方误差（MSE）和竞争性的平均绝对误差（MAE）。

Conclusion: SST-iTransformer通过有效建模时空依赖和多源数据整合，为停车位可用性预测提供了高性能解决方案，并揭示了网约车数据对预测的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Motivation: 现实实验场景中存在异方差偶然不确定性，且批量设置中这种不确定性可能相关。研究旨在利用偏差-方差权衡关系减少偏差。

Method: 提出基于偏差-协方差关系的主动学习策略，结合二次估计器和特征分解策略，优化批量设置中的学习效果。

Result: 在批量设置中使用该方法时，表现优于BALD和Least Confidence等经典方法。

Conclusion: 通过偏差-协方差关系的新方法在主动学习中有效减少偏差，提升性能。

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

TL;DR: PagedEviction是一种针对KV缓存的高效修剪策略，提升内存效率，适用于长序列任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在长序列任务中成为内存瓶颈，需要更高效的修剪策略。

Method: 提出PagedEviction，一种基于分页内存布局的块级修剪算法。

Result: 在多个模型上验证，内存使用更优且准确性高于基线。

Conclusion: PagedEviction有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型在迭代扩散模型的高保真度与高效少步模型的硬质量上限之间存在矛盾，TiM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种精确的连续时间动态方程，定义了任意有限时间间隔内的状态转移，从而构建了Transition Models (TiM)。

Result: TiM在865M参数下超越了SD3.5和FLUX.1等更大模型，且在增加采样步数时质量单调提升，支持高达4096x4096分辨率。

Conclusion: TiM通过灵活的步数适应性和高质量输出，为生成模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

TL;DR: IPA是一种特征感知投影框架，通过保留降维空间中的信息，优于LoRA和DoRA方法，在多个任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的下投影随机初始化且数据无关，丢弃了潜在有用信息，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出IPA框架，利用近似主成分分析的算法预训练投影器，保留降维空间中的信息。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务中，IPA平均比LoRA和DoRA高1.5和2.3个准确率点，且参数更少。

Conclusion: IPA通过信息保留机制显著提升了参数高效微调的性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

Result: HCL在理论和实证中表现优异，能够识别可解释的因果异质性，并在单细胞扰动数据中恢复生物学机制。

Conclusion: HCL为发现可解释的机制级因果异质性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 论文通过理论推导和实验验证，证明了在线和离线训练方法的统一性，HPT算法在性能和稳定性上均表现出色。

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.
