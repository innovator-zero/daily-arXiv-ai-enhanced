Here, we present a physics-inspired\ncooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the\ndissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a\ndecentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous\nformation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of\nexplicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended\npayload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to\nenergy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control\nsystem is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors\nof the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches\nunder the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and\npayload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying\nrobots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success\nrate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,\nand 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor\nwinds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges\nswarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable\nframework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex\ntransportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8017\u6563\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6545\u969c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u8f93\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u4eff\u684c\u817f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u8017\u6563\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8017\u6563\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u961f\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe94%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u8f93\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Addressing these biases individually proves\ninadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We\ntackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a\nlean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and\nminimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)\ndeliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders\nfor each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the\nclassifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine\nTuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving\na single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to\nrecognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup\nimbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias\nAmplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias\namplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,\nCelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute\nbias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and\ndistribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end\nmultibias solution for visual recognition.

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors.

However, adapting\nthese models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on\nprompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing\nadaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and\nadapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,\nand compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we\npresent \\textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \\textit{multi-modal} and\n\\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without\ninjecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular\nvalues of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain\nadaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced\nadaptation performance using only \\textbf{0.04\\%} of the model's total\nparameters and better preservation of its generalization ability.

To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE\nalgorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature.

We refer to this problem\nas the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test\nfor a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only\na subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial\ninformation. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem\ncould be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In\npractice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects\nare tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can\nbias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic\nMDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as\n$\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ rate in\nepisodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This\nelevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose\ncumulative regret is $\\tilde{O}(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and\nGaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent\nrewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum\nEntropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This\nstructure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ lower\nbound for OTP.

The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,\ngoal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,\nconfigurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'\nweaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative\npolicy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics.

Project website:\n  https://dense-functional-correspondence.github.io/", "summary": "Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks\nsuch as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting\nof matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the\neffect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences\nshould be established. This is because object parts that enable specific\nfunctions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the\ndefinition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and\npropose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.\nThe main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language\nmodels to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts.

Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap\nmeasures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.\nAlthough topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown\npromise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global\npreservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological\nrefinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a\nholistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)\nfirst introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly\nenforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a\ncurriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct\nerrors from coarse to fine scales.

Unlike\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D\nplane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial\nstructures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the\nvertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis\ninformation when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style\nchannel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting\ntheir ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal\nframework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract\nvoxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical\nslices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained\nspatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose\nthe SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through\naverage pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height\nlayer.

Despite high performance, modern ML models\ndo not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may\npredict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and\nsurvival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a\nreproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model\nbehavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of\nunderspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome\nprediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by\nincorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into\nthe ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and\nbehavior across degrees of underspecification.

Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of\n85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for\ndrivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with\nonly 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs.

A Precision-Recall Approach to Dimensionality Reduction Validation", "comment": null, "summary": "Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional\ndata, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure.

Existing DR quality\nmetrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure\nquality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual\nAnalytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large\nhyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent\nframework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,\nwhere similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data\nis projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and\nrecall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the\nmodeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some\nset of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application\nusing t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage\nscenarios.

Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be\nframed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first\ndiscovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a\ndecision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive\nMOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with\ngeneric surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is\ninefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:\na point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy\nfor a fixed privacy level.

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

Though few-step distillation methods, particularly\nConsistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in\naccelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex\n3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation.

Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation.

We train the model\nusing a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the\nsame portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as\nthe target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on\nthese inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of\nattributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy\nusing keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we\nfurther augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and\nappearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional\nmisalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively\ngeneralize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,\ndespite being trained without explicit triplet supervision.

While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

This\nsurvey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on\nthe perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging\npipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for\nanalyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of\ndomain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform\nsampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.\nBuilding on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300\nresearch papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method\nanalysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific\nchallenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task\ncomparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual\nquality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal\nunderstanding, and visual generation.
