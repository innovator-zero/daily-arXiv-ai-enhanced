In heterogeneous settings, its\nvalues are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model\nconfuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed\ndistributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values\nreflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their\nindividual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic\nnormalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and\ncolumn normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the\nunderlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it\nenables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted\nimprovements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix\nnormalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard\nand bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,\noffering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a\nclassifier."}

Instead, we\ndemonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted\nsuccessor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few\ninitial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the\nentry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor\nmeasure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation\nand estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral\nrecoverability of the corresponding matrix.

Applying contrastive\nmethods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all\nparts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of\ncertain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make\nnegative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues\nlead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor\nresults in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised\nlearning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This\nframework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new\nself-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation\ntechnique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to\nseveral contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,\nsemi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages."}

Our results show\nthat MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of\nconditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\nAdditionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and\nfind that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing\nuncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our\nexperiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of\nexperts can further enhance uncertainty calibration.

As a critical\nstep toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer\nvision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We\nadapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear\nratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The\nmodels were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean\nabsolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis\nrevealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,\nthough further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability\nassessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related\nfeatures. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions\nassociated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted\nspiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer\nvision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both\nmodel explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective\nemotion-aware therapeutic technologies."}

Experiments using five-fold cross-validation\nshowed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)\ncompared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =\n10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds.

We\nexplore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness\nby replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby\nincreasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet\narchitectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer\nin the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD\nand AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we\ndiscover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to\ncollapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating\nadversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.\nAs a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in\nrobustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding\nfeedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the\nzonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and\nhardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and\na convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a\nROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides\nstable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms\nof both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance."}

We study symbolic graphics programming, where\nthe goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task\nalso serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting\nthem to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper\nsticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to\nwhich LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and\ncompositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On\nSGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially\noutperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general\ncoding capabilities.

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards\napproach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a\ncross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision\nencoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to\nQwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and\nsemantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems.
