Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain\nskill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a\ndomain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an\noffline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The\nprototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of\nlong-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.\nFurthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a\ndynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter\ntoward better alignment with the target domain.

To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted\nusing a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally\nintroducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,\nconsisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for\nfacial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression.

ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba\noffer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture\nfine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess\nstrong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning\ncapabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs\nand multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a\nhierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract\nrich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later\nstages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently\nmodel long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for\nsuperior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with\nrespect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through\nextensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic\nsegmentation.

However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric\nforms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited\nto simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new\ninput-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new\nbehaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We\ntarget this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal\ndecision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires\nmodels flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich\nexternal stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first\npropose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of\npolicy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering\nground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)\nthat captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial\nhistory. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory\ndecision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on\nheld-out data.

To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets.

While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)\nprovide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions\nand/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation\nis the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing\nspatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main\nlimitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,\nroad networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus\nmissing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic\nalgorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn\nentities matching in a data-driven manner.

We argue that first-order\noptimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly\nreshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information.

Evaluated\non 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean\nabsolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and\nsurpassing prior CNN-based methods.

Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of\ncryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This\nplanning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading\nto variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we\nintroduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation\nplanning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for\ncryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical\nconstraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially\nselects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward\nfunction based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy\nthat leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any\nmanually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,\nCryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the\nbest automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human\nexpert performance while requiring substantially less planning time.

However, standard\nMLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value\nproblems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a\nspectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we\nintroduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired\nby classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with\nvariable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a\nspectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics\nwhich is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE).

This is often a key\nobstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.\nIn this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm\nlayer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform\nmore stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.\nHowever, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed\nand still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial\nsolutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into\nthis, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often\nundergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that\ncertain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)\nthe model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification\nbias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy\nminimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)\nremove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights\nto go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy\nsamples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation\ncollapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce\ninter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an\ninequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype\ncentroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.\nPromising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior\nmethods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAR\u548cSAR^2\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6279\u91cf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9aTTA\uff1bSAR^2\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9632\u6b62\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAR\u548cSAR^2\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "SAR\u548cSAR^2\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86TTA\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, due to severe illumination degradation and the\nlack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle\nto quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,\nthere is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on\nlow-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically\ngrounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light\nsettings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to\ndate for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and optical flow estimation.

Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based\nhypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions\ngenerated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled\nsamples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE\nparametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can\nhandle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions\nwith varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary\nconditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot\naccuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming\nU-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we\nintroduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the\ngenerated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a\n\"delta\" PINN.

To address this limitation, we introduce the\nScale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture\nthat synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational\nmodeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale\nmodule with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying\nreceptive fields.

Instead, we\ndemonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted\nsuccessor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few\ninitial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the\nentry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor\nmeasure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation\nand estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral\nrecoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive\na new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II\nPoincar\\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift\nneeded for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows\nin particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order\nsingular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small\nin practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary\nshift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which\nprovides a natural way of selecting the shift.

Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods\nlike contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn\nmeaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of\nthe same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the\npositive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide\ninformation that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive\nmethods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all\nparts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of\ncertain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make\nnegative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues\nlead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor\nresults in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised\nlearning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR.
