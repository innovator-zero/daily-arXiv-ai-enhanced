While techniques like\nActive Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying\ninformative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight\nof human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an\nemployed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\napproaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine\nlearning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),\neffective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.\nThis thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and\ninvestigating \"VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection\".\nVILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,\ntogether with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views.

However, existing\nsolutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target\nvariables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into\nthe model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to\npromote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two\nchallenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the\ntarget system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and\nfuture variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\model, a\nnovel framework for modeling \\underline{exo}genous variables in\n\\underline{s}patio-\\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,\nthen balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated\nexpert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent\nspace to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized\nsub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which\nrecomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into\ndual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs\nare integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic\nbalance during the modeling process.

We show that Transformer-style architectures can\neffectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction\nof high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework\non event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its\nutility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual\nevaluation.

Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across\nsensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state\nLiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on\nhandheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we\npropose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on\nsensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a\nKalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with\nLiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We\npropose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model\nfor IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map\napproach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR\nregistration, improving the overall odometry performance.

This combination of modalities allows for\nprecise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental\nconditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks.

Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,\nincluding coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the\nrepresentations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This\napproach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also\nenables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from\nthe teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of\npre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to\nmitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on\nlarge-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios."}

In this article we test a transformer designed for lane\nchange intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and\nHong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a\npopulation different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low\nas 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could\nachieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the\nIEEE for possible publication.

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views.

Our key innovation is semantic\ndescriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each\nimage patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce\nimage-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of\nsegmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling\npipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding\n(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of\nsemantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\\times$, without\ncompromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg\nachieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.\nTo further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic\ndescriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and\nrepresents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks.

In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by\nquantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR\nframework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the\nhigh-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint\n(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous\nhint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint\nlength for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the\noptimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In\neach round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs\ncollected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next\nround. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem\ndifficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration\nefficiency.

In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured.

We also show that hallucinations in the\noutput of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept\npatterns embedded in transformer layer activations.

In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples.

However, their high cost, limited\nresolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,\nparticularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we\npresent Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time\nevent generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct\naccess to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors\n(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,\ndelivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output\nthan RGB-based frame-to-event converters.\n  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable\nsimulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further\ndesign a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,\nRGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset\ncreation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams\nclosely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher\nresolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive\nparameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application\nrequirements.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes\ncounter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high\naccuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time\nof 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time\napplications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed\nmodel achieves accuracy rates of 95\\% and 97\\% in the LPD and CR detection\nphases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN\npre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\\%,\nespecially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the\nlearning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR\ndatasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more\nrepresentative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings\ndemonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent\noverall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable\napplications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary\nprocessing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,\nparticularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as\ninput."}

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from\nautoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in\ntext generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a\nseries of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for\nrobot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present\nLLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon\npretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to\nrobotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token\nclassification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with\nspecial action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a\nhierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences\nhierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots."}

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models\npredominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to\nshort-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,\nwe introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual\nforesight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a\nMixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,\nforesight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,\nand actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to\nsynthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By\nforecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation\nas a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that\nimplicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable\ncapabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset\ncomprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training\nscheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual\nforesight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive\nevaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1\nconsistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in\nboth task success rate and generalization ability."}

Classical\nmotion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full\nenvironment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural\nmotion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop\ndirectly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or\ndynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural\nmotion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic\nenvironments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is\nIMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million\ngenerated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further\nimprove IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher\nfinetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at\ninference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We\nevaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving\nobstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,\noutperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both\nsimulated and real-world settings.
