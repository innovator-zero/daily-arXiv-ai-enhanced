### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一种基于Transformer的架构，旨在学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态基础表示，无需微调即可泛化到未见数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合异构数据集，但批次效应和缺乏泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 引入CellPainTR，采用源特定上下文标记设计，支持跨数据集泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony，且在未见数据集Bray上表现稳健。

Conclusion: CellPainTR为基于图像的生物分析提供了更可靠和可扩展的基础模型。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLO和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，用于铁路缺陷检测，结合图像和音频信号，提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态方法（如YOLO）在铁路缺陷检测中存在过检问题，尤其是在外观相似的情况下。多模态融合可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 结合YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer，从图像和音频信号中提取特征，并在多个层次进行融合，用于检测铁路断裂和表面缺陷。

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上，多模态融合比纯视觉方法精度提高了0.2点，且统计检验证实了差异的显著性。

Conclusion: 多模态融合能有效提升铁路缺陷检测的精度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过子空间投影和特征重构误差实现领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，不适合数据隐私保护场景。

Method: 使用分类器权重的正交分解提取已知类子空间，映射特征并计算重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得领先性能。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的无需训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，适用于小规模数据集，无需标签且超参数少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模数据集在专业领域中持续预训练的挑战，弥补预训练模型缺乏重要信息的问题。

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，通过简单目标函数适应新数据分布，无需标签且超参数少。

Result: 在仅使用1000张图像的情况下，显著提升了DINOv3等先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: DIET-CP是一种稳定且高效的持续预训练方法，适用于多种数据模态和骨干模型。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强FPT对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，显著提升了模型在非IID设置下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPT方法在跨客户端协作微调VLMs时容易受到对抗攻击，导致下游任务分类错误。FedAPT旨在解决这一问题，特别是在非IID设置下的类信息差距问题。

Method: 提出类感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入生成视觉提示，并采用跨层生成器共享策略增强提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上，FedAPT显著提升了对抗鲁棒性，优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: FedAPT通过解决类信息差距和增强提示耦合，有效提升了FPT的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD)框架，用于评估开源视觉语言模型在企业应用中的实际表现，填补了学术评估与企业需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的开源视觉语言模型评估主要依赖选择题和合成数据，无法满足企业实际应用（如社交媒体内容分析）的复杂需求。

Method: ViLD框架定义了十项企业关键任务，并引入BlockWeaver算法解决OCR输出比较问题，同时构建了包含7,500个样本的新基准数据集。

Result: ViLD通过结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法，评估了Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源模型，提供了行业驱动的任务评估结果。

Conclusion: ViLD为开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的部署提供了实用评估框架和可操作建议。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一种自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部数据提升医学影像模型的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像数据中的潜在混杂因素（如扫描参数）影响了仅基于图像的模型的泛化能力，因此需要一种协议感知的方法。

Method: 结合协议-图像对比学习、掩码协议预测和协议-协议翻译，学习DICOM头部和图像特征的联合表示。

Result: 在多个任务（肺栓塞、脑胶质瘤分级、心脏肥大检测）中，Protocol Genome显著提升了AUROC和校准性能。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome在减少假阳性、提升跨站点和跨模态性能方面具有临床价值，并提供了部署指南和模型审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了高级视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否具备人类对字符的识别韧性，发现模型在字符被破坏时表现不佳，揭示了其结构局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否具备人类对字符的识别韧性，尤其是在字符被分割、重组或部分遮挡时。

Method: 构建了两个心理物理学启发的基准测试，分别针对中文和英文，通过拼接、重组和叠加字符生成对模型不可读但对人类可读的刺激。

Result: 尽管在干净文本上表现良好，VLMs在字符被破坏时表现显著下降，输出不相关或不连贯。

Conclusion: VLMs过度依赖通用视觉不变性，缺乏组合性先验知识，需改进架构和训练策略以提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在频率域进行特征级学习的方法，通过时间融合策略生成k空间数据，以解决动态心脏MRI重建中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态心脏MRI的k空间数据通常质量低且多样性不足，限制了重建的鲁棒性。

Method: 在频率域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，结合时间融合策略生成k空间数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低数据量情况下具有强大的生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有望缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

### [11] [Not All Splits Are Equal: Rethinking Attribute Generalization Across Unrelated Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06998)
*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨模型是否能跨语义和感知差异的类别泛化属性知识，发现当前模型在训练与测试类别相关性降低时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前模型在属性预测任务中是否能抽象属性并应用于概念上不相关的类别，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入基于LLM语义分组、嵌入相似性阈值、嵌入聚类和超类别分区的训练-测试分割策略，逐步减少训练与测试集的相关性。

Result: 结果显示，随着训练与测试类别相关性降低，模型性能急剧下降，聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性同时保持可学习性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前表征的局限性，为未来属性推理基准的构建提供了新见解。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种人机交互框架，用于定量评估LLM生成的3D模型，通过多种输入模态和指标提升生成模型的几何和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM生成3D模型几何和结构保真度的稳健方法，限制了其在CAD设计、逆向工程和快速原型等应用中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一套全面的相似性和复杂性指标（如体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性），并通过四种输入模态（2D正交视图、等距草图、几何结构树和代码修正提示）进行系统比较。

Result: 研究发现，语义丰富的输入（如代码级提示）能实现完美重建，且定量评估方法显著加快了向真实模型的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 本文不仅推动了AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和优化生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS²是一种新型内存高效框架，通过联合优化原始数量和每个原始参数，显著减少3D高斯泼溅的内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在边缘设备上因高内存消耗而受限，现有压缩方法多关注存储压缩，未解决渲染内存瓶颈。

Method: 用轻量级任意方向球形高斯瓣替代内存密集型球谐函数，并提出统一软剪枝框架，将原始数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为约束优化问题。

Result: 实验显示，MEGS²在保持渲染质量的同时，静态VRAM减少50%，渲染VRAM减少40%。

Conclusion: MEGS²有效解决了3DGS的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯性正则化方法存在局限性，需要一种更高效且统一的方法来提升生成模型的表现。

Method: 结合空间域和频谱域的损失函数，利用已知的矩和功率谱分布期望值，确保样本符合标准高斯分布。

Result: 新正则化方法优于现有方法，有效防止奖励欺骗并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法在生成模型中表现优异，尤其在提升美学和文本对齐方面。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Conclusion: 奖励驱动的优化框架显著提升了基础模型的适应性和性能，适用于多样化的分割任务。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在内存和计算资源有限的环境中高效分类流数据的挑战。

Method: 通过数据蒸馏提取数据流中的关键特征，减少计算需求并保留分类所需信息。

Result: DBC方法在图像数据流分类中达到73.1%的准确率，优于传统方法和RBC技术。

Conclusion: DBC方法在流数据分类中表现出色，为复杂数据流的处理设立了新的准确性和效率标准。

Abstract: This study tackles the challenge of efficiently classifying streaming data in
envi-ronments with limited memory and computational resources. It delves into
the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational
demands while preserving crucial information for accurate classification. Our
investigation com-pares this approach against traditional algorithms like
Hoeffding Trees and Adap-tive Random Forest, adapted through embeddings for
image data. The Distillation Based Classification (DBC) demonstrated superior
performance, achieving a 73.1% accuracy rate, surpassing both traditional
methods and Reservoir Sam-pling Based Classification (RBC) technique. This
marks a significant advance-ment in streaming data classification, showcasing
the effectiveness of our method in processing complex data streams and setting
a new standard for accuracy and efficiency.

### [17] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation基准，评估13个大型多模态模型在性别偏见上的表现，发现模型普遍放大职业性别刻板印象，但部分模型通过设计选择可实现公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）的性别偏见时存在方法学限制，缺乏大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。

Method: 使用75个性别中立提示生成图像，涵盖刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业，并通过LLM评分系统评估965张图像的性别代表性。

Result: 模型普遍放大性别刻板印象（男性职业93%为男性，女性职业仅22.5%），且存在默认男性偏见（非刻板职业68.3%为男性），但部分模型表现接近性别平等。

Conclusion: 性别偏见并非不可避免，设计选择可改善公平性，标准化评估工具对促进AI公平发展至关重要。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

### [18] [Faster VGGT with Block-Sparse Global Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07120)
*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的全局注意力替代方案，显著提升了多视图重建模型的推理速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）因全局注意力层的二次复杂度面临运行时瓶颈，限制了其在大规模图像集上的扩展性。

Method: 通过分析全局注意力矩阵，发现注意力集中在少数跨视图几何匹配的patch交互上，提出使用优化的块稀疏核替代密集全局注意力操作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个多视图基准测试中有效，推理速度提升高达4倍，且无需重新训练主干网络。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏核方案显著提升了模型效率，适用于VGGT和π³，并支持大规模图像集。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [19] [Detection and Recovery of Adversarial Slow-Pose Drift in Offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07130)
*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absurd,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督、无标签的检测与恢复机制，用于防御视觉惯性里程计（VIO）在边缘服务器上的姿态欺骗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势可能导致服务器端的安全威胁，微小的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查。

Method: 模型在无攻击会话中训练，学习运动的时间规律性以检测运行时偏差并启动恢复以恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上评估，结果显示轨迹和姿态误差相比无防御基线显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了姿态欺骗攻击带来的误差，提升了VIO系统的安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

### [20] [Realism to Deception: Investigating Deepfake Detectors Against Face Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07178)
*Muhammad Saad Saeed,Ijaz Ul Haq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人脸增强技术可能降低深度伪造检测器的准确性，甚至可作为反取证工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人脸增强技术在提升视觉质量的同时，是否会对深度伪造检测器的性能产生负面影响。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和基于GAN的增强技术，评估其对不同类型检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验显示，基础增强滤镜可显著降低检测准确率（ASR达64.63%），而GAN技术效果更显著（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强技术可作为反取证工具，需开发更具适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

*Erencem Ozbey,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全无监督的方法，利用Vision Transformers和流形学习技术来发现新类别，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，现有方法多为半监督学习，而本文探索了完全无监督的方法来解决新类别发现问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成向量嵌入，并结合流形学习技术优化嵌入，以提高图像聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet上实现了最先进的单模态聚类和新类别发现结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在已知或未知聚类数量的情况下均表现优异，为无监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [22] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种结合图像特征和临床文本的双提示双分支多模态模型，用于精确的乳腺超声分割，显著提升了小病灶的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声分割对于小或低对比度病灶的精确测量和分析具有挑战性，现有方法容易产生模糊边界。

Method: XBusNet结合全局CLIP Vision Transformer和局部U-Net路径，通过自动生成的文本提示（如形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语）优化分割。

Result: 在BLU数据集上，XBusNet的Dice和IoU分别达到0.8765和0.8149，优于六种基线方法，小病灶提升最显著。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支设计结合全局语义和局部精度，显著提升了乳腺超声分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

*Sepehr Salem,M. Moein Esfahani,Jingyu Liu,Vince Calhoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散概率模型（DPM）的数据增强框架，用于解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，并在乳腺癌热图分类中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺限制了深度学习的应用，需要一种有效的数据增强方法。

Method: 使用DPM进行数据增强，结合预训练的ResNet-50深度特征和手工非线性特征（如分形维度），通过XGBoost分类器进行分类。

Result: 分类准确率达到98.0%，灵敏度为98.1%，验证了DPM增强和非线性特征融合的重要性。

Conclusion: 先进生成模型与可解释特征的结合可显著提升医学诊断工具的准确性。

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecA是一种资源高效的后训练方法，通过利用视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集“文本提示”，显著提升统一多模态模型的生成和编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练依赖稀疏的图像-文本对，缺乏细粒度视觉细节，RecA旨在通过自监督重建损失重新对齐理解和生成。

Method: RecA利用视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集提示，通过自监督重建损失优化模型以重构输入图像。

Result: RecA在多种UMM架构中一致提升生成和编辑性能，仅用27 GPU小时即显著提升多个基准测试分数。

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种UMM架构，性能超越更大的开源模型。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的无人机多光谱目标检测方法DEPF，通过双域增强和优先级引导的Mamba融合解决低光照图像、局部小目标建模和计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多光谱遥感目标检测中的低光照图像互补性差、局部小目标建模干扰和高计算复杂度问题。

Method: 设计了双域增强模块（DDE）和优先级引导Mamba融合模块（PGMF），分别用于图像增强和目标特征融合。

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DEPF方法在多光谱目标检测中有效解决了现有挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为G$^{3}$CN的新方法，通过高斯滤波器和GRU增强GCN在骨架动作识别中的表现，特别是在区分模糊动作方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN在骨架动作识别中表现优异，但在区分模糊动作时存在局限性，需要改进拓扑和空间特征的表示。

Method: 结合高斯滤波器优化骨架拓扑图，并引入GRU增强信息传播。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（NTU RGB+D等），G$^{3}$CN显著提升了模糊动作的识别效果。

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN通过拓扑优化和信息传播增强，有效解决了GCN在模糊动作识别中的不足。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

TL;DR: PGVL通过结合视觉和语言模态，利用解析图和引导模块（GM）提升遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力，尤其是语言提供的丰富先验信息（如空间关系）在遮挡场景中的作用。

Method: 提出PGVL框架，包含解析图和引导模块（GM），通过低层节点保留局部特征、高层节点整合全局特征，并结合双向跨注意力机制实现多模态有效融合。

Result: 在主流姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和所设计网络的有效性。

Conclusion: PGVL通过多模态交互和层级特征整合，显著提升了遮挡场景下的姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成方法多关注几何建模，缺乏对PBR材质的端到端支持，LGAA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: LGAA包含Wrapper、Switcher和Decoder三个模块，利用多视角扩散先验和2D高斯泼溅技术。

Result: 实验表明LGAA在文本和图像条件下均表现优异，且数据效率高（仅需69k多视角实例）。

Conclusion: LGAA为高质量、可重光照的3D资产生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Result: 实验显示现有MLLMs难以准确理解用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 注视信息对实现个性化且高效的AI助手在自我中心场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

*Pooya Khosravi,Kun Han,Anthony T. Wu,Arghavan Rezvani,Zexin Feng,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一种新型深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合，提升OCT到OCTA转换的质量，尤其关注视网膜层间血管差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取成本高且易受运动影响，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建复杂血管细节。

Method: 结合跨维度监督（CDS）和多尺度特征融合（MSFF）网络，利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，增强血管细节重建。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上表现优异，显著提升临床评估所需的en-face投影质量。

Conclusion: XOCT提高了OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，有望用于眼科疾病检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘的偏置缓解方法，通过选择性移除偏置样本或特征表示，显著提升了视觉模型的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络常依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在关键领域（如医学和自动驾驶）中产生偏置预测。传统方法需要从头训练或重新设计数据流程，而机器遗忘提供了一种后处理的替代方案。

Method: 研究采用Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning范式，结合梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏等技术，在三个基准数据集上评估了后处理遗忘的效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CUB-200、CIFAR-10和CelebA数据集上分别提升了94.86%、30.28%和97.37%的公平性，且准确率损失最小。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是一种实用的框架，可在不重新训练的情况下提升已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Method: 结合视频扩散模型的时间先验和图像扩散模型的重光照能力，提出Refinement Projection Algorithm确保前景一致性。

Result: 在消费级GPU上实现高质量视频生成，前景一致性和时间相干性表现优异。

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL为视频内容创作提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is
publicly available with reproducible training and inference scripts and
contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical
imaging domains. We make the code publicly available:

Motivation: 矢量图形的动画通常需要大量手动操作，现有技术在灵活性和动画质量上存在局限。

Method: 采用分层隐式神经表示重建矢量图形，利用视频分数蒸馏采样优化神经表示，并通过变形生成平滑动画。

Result: 实验证明该方法能生成生动自然的矢量图形动画，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了矢量图形动画的自动化问题，提升了动画质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Motivation: 传统导航系统在室内因缺乏精确位置数据而效果不佳，需改进以提升视障人士的独立性和可访问性。

Method: 使用LoRA微调BLIP-2模型，并在手动标注的室内导航数据集上训练，提出改进的BERT F1评估指标。

Result: 应用LoRA后，模型在生成方向性指令方面显著提升，克服了原始BLIP-2模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了室内导航的准确性和实用性，为视障人士提供了更好的辅助工具。

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

TL;DR: DiGS将SDF学习嵌入3DGS框架，提升表面重建的准确性和完整性，同时保持高渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在渲染方面表现优异，但缺乏显式几何监督，导致表面重建不完整和不准确。

Method: DiGS通过为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值，显式对齐几何，并设计几何引导的网格增长策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DiGS显著提升了重建准确性和完整性，同时保持高渲染质量。

Conclusion: DiGS通过结合SDF学习，为3DGS提供了更强的几何约束，实现了更优的表面重建效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过局部混合和逻辑优化增强对抗样本可转移性的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合策略可能破坏全局语义特征并导致梯度消失，限制了对抗样本的质量和可转移性。

Method: 采用局部混合策略生成多样化输入，并引入逻辑损失和扰动平滑损失优化对抗样本。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上表现优异，黑盒攻击成功率平均提升17.28%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了对抗样本的可转移性和攻击效果。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高，弱监督方法依赖2D标注但存在投影模糊性和部分可见性问题。

Method: 提出MVAT框架，利用多视角时序数据聚合点云，采用教师-学生蒸馏范式生成伪标签，并引入多视角2D投影损失。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著缩小与全监督方法的差距。

Conclusion: MVAT无需3D标注即可实现高性能弱监督3D目标检测，代码已开源。

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Conclusion: EHWGesture可作为推进多模态临床手势理解的综合基准。

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Result: 在六个新空间控制任务中，仅用30个标注样本微调即可实现精细控制，性能接近全监督基线。

Conclusion: UFC是一种高效且通用的适配器，适用于多种扩散模型架构。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Result: 在五个公开的3D医学影像数据集上，该方法显著提升了性能（BTCV:~84.64%，Flare22:~92.43%，MM-WHS:~90.67%，Amos22:~88.64%，BraTS:~78.55%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域特定的MIM策略对医学图像分割的表征学习具有重要意义，并提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the

directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first

queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在现有工作中表现有效。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效的高斯全头重建，为快速渲染提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言基础模型（VLMs）中的性别偏见评估可能因非性别特征的干扰而失真，建议在评估时加入特征敏感性测量以提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前性别偏见评估方法可能因非性别特征（如物体和背景）的干扰而失真，需要验证这些干扰是否影响评估结果。

Method: 通过系统扰动四个常用基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP和PHASE）中的非性别特征，量化其对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使轻微扰动（如遮挡10%物体或模糊背景）也会显著改变偏见分数，生成式VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体达43%。

Conclusion: 当前偏见评估可能反映的是模型对干扰特征的反应而非真实性别偏见，建议在报告中加入特征敏感性测量以提高评估可靠性。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效微调方法，用于3D医学影像的视觉语言模型，应用于阿尔茨海默病诊断，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型未充分利用患者元数据和临床诊断知识，且在3D医学影像上表现有限。

Method: 通过将结构化元数据转换为合成报告，并添加辅助标记预测MMSE分数，结合轻量级提示调整。

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个AD数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D医学影像的诊断效果，且数据效率高。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Method: 自监督交叉编码器框架，将表示解耦为静态（对比学习约束）和动态（输入梯度正则化）两部分。

Conclusion: 该方法在分类和可解释性上表现优异，并具有泛化能力，代码将公开。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW)的新方法，通过保持频率完整性来提升语义水印的检测性能，并引入中心感知嵌入策略以增强抗裁剪攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义水印技术在再生攻击中表现稳健，但因频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降。

Method: SFW通过强制Hermitian对称性保持频率完整性，并结合中心感知嵌入策略减少裁剪攻击的脆弱性。

Result: 实验表明，SFW在多种攻击场景下实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，同时保持图像保真度。

Conclusion: SFW是一种有效平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的框架，解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Method: 将任务重新定义为张量低秩和稀疏分解问题，提出TenRPCANet网络，利用自注意力机制隐式强制多阶张量低秩先验，并通过特征细化模块增强目标显著性。

Result: 在红外小目标检测和空间目标检测任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且通用，适用于复杂环境中的小目标检测。

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有方法在深度差异场景中表现不佳，需更高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: 使用指数衰减基函数的自由形变网络和自适应稀疏运动聚合器，结合渐进相关细化策略。

Result: 参数、内存和运行时间显著减少，PSNR提升0.5 dB，局部细化后提升1.06 dB。

Conclusion: EDFFDNet在效率和精度上优于现有方法，且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN等基准测试中表现优异，同时提升了鲁棒性和干净样本的准确率。

Conclusion: 显式处理类间特征接近性对增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Conclusion: 结合代理和批评机制能有效提升复杂视频推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用单一熵模型难以捕捉图像不同语义区域的统计特性，限制了压缩效率。

Method: 利用语义分割指导多熵模型的选择和适配，结合多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素分布。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最优压缩比，且编码解码延迟极低。

Conclusion: SEEC通过多熵模型和语义分割的结合，显著提升了无损图像压缩的性能。

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Result: 多模态模型在复发检测（AUC 0.84）和复发自由生存时间预测（c-index 0.68，AUC 0.71）中表现良好。

Conclusion: 心脏疾病和颈动脉之间存在关联，未来将通过更多数据收集和模型优化进一步验证这一发现。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Conclusion: 该方法在头发几何重建和拓扑评估上表现出色，为虚拟现实和数字人体建模提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Motivation: RayGauss在合成和室内场景中实现了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本高，无法在真实场景中实时渲染。

Method: 引入空空间跳过、自适应采样等加速策略，增强光线一致性，提出新的密度分布准则。

Result: 训练速度提升5-12倍，渲染速度提升50-80倍，PSNR提升0.56 dB。

Conclusion: RayGaussX在保持高质量的同时大幅提升了效率，适用于更大场景。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和图像质量上均优于现有技术，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在多视图图像生成高质量3D场景方面表现出色，但修复缺失区域（如遮挡或编辑）仍存在模糊、伪影和几何不一致的问题。

Method: 结合深度和对象监督确保修复的高斯分布准确放置，并提出一致性感知细化方案选择性修正不一致区域。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越现有方法，训练时间减少24.5%，细节更清晰、伪影更少。

Conclusion: SplatFill在3D场景修复中实现了最先进的感知质量和效率提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

TL;DR: PLM框架通过OcDR和GRD解决了LLMs与3D点云表示不对齐的问题，显著提升了3D分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，LLMs与3D点云的表示不对齐限制了输入和输出阶段的效果，导致语义混淆和细粒度精度损失。

Method: 提出PLM框架，包含OcDR（学习目标语义和场景关系的对象中心表示）和GRD（结合几何与密集特征的解码器）。

Result: 在ScanNetv2和Multi3DRefer等基准上，PLM分别提升了7.3和6.0 mIoU，并在多个任务中表现一致。

Conclusion: PLM通过对象中心推理有效解决了表示不对齐问题，提升了3D理解的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental
monitoring, disaster management, and assessment of climate change. This study
presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答任务中表现优异，但容易产生与视觉输入冲突的幻觉文本。现有方法未能准确定位问题层，因此需要更精细的诊断和修正方法。

Method: 提出两种诊断工具：层图像注意力熵（LIAE）和图像注意力聚焦（IAF），用于定位问题层和评分注意力头。基于此，开发了动态层间熵和注意力融合方法（D-LEAF）。

Result: D-LEAF在标准图像描述任务中相对改进53%，在视觉问答任务中准确率和F1分数均提升约4%，显著抑制了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: D-LEAF通过动态定位和修正注意力错误，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Conclusion: aMINT为AI部署提供了更强的透明度和安全保障。

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

Motivation: 现有方法在图像级别建立相关性时难以抑制背景噪声，导致过拟合。

Method: 设计OCNet，包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关性构建模块（CCM），通过对象级相关性匹配目标原型。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 对象级相关性能有效减少噪声，提升少样本分割效果。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ScoreHOI通过扩散先验和物理约束，显著提升了人-物交互重建的质量。

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有牙齿分割方法缺乏严格验证且性能有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提升分割精度和临床适用性。

Method: 采用多模态对比学习（ToothMCL）整合CBCT和IOS数据，捕捉模态不变特征，实现精确的多类分割和牙齿编号识别。

Conclusion: ToothMCL是一种高效的多模态牙齿分割方法，具有广泛的应用前景和临床价值。

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地AI日益普及，但目标检测器在消费级硬件上的实际性能与基准测试存在显著差距，尤其是在资源受限的系统上，性能受限于系统级瓶颈而非计算能力。

Method: 引入了一种模型无关的两阶段自适应推理算法，无需架构修改，通过快速低分辨率检测和仅在检测置信度低时升级到高分辨率模型来优化性能。

Result: 在5000张COCO数据集图像上，该方法比PyTorch Early-Exit基线实现了1.85倍加速，仅损失5.51%的mAP。

Conclusion: 该研究为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了实用方案，通过硬件感知的推理策略最大化吞吐量，而非单纯依赖模型优化。

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，适用于多种DNN，并在单GPU上高效运行。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited

across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源方法推理模式单调且交互轮次有限，难以应对需要试错探索的复杂任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe Dataset、开发迭代数据收集管道、提出over-turn masking策略。

Result: Mini-o3能生成数十轮推理路径，性能随轮次增加而提升，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过多轮深度推理和多样化模式，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的解决能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Motivation: 解决单视图重建缺乏度量尺度和生成模型与真实图像之间的域差距问题，以支持机器人操作中的长尾实例。

Method: 使用粗到细对齐模块联合优化尺度和姿态，并结合文本引导的生成域随机化策略增强合成数据的多样性。

Conclusion: OnePoseViaGen通过高保真单视图3D生成和域随机化策略，实现了可靠的6D姿态估计，适用于实际机器人操作。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉任务中表现不足，主要因文本监督导致视觉细节丢失。

Method: 提出VIRAL，通过对齐MLLMs与预训练视觉模型的内部表示来保留视觉细节。

Result: 实验表明VIRAL在多模态基准任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: VIRAL为MLLMs中视觉信息的有效整合提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

### [75] [Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06974)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康至关重要，因此需要可靠且易用的预测工具以进行预防性干预。

Method: 模型结合多尺度卷积层、循环层和注意力机制，采用两阶段域适应策略增强泛化能力。

Result: 模型在多种输入和预测窗口下表现优异，最佳RMSE为0.216（3天输入窗口和1天预测窗口）。

Conclusion: 该框架为个性化睡眠预测提供了鲁棒、自适应且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单数据集下评估，缺乏对跨数据集迁移性的研究，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的潜力。

Method: 在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估五种代表性自监督方法在多样化目标图上的表现，标准化实验设置以排除干扰因素。

Result: 大多数图自监督方法泛化能力差，甚至不如随机初始化，而GraphMAE（掩码自编码器方法）表现稳定且优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图自监督方法迁移性的关键因素，为图学习的'预训练-迁移'范式奠定了基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SongYYYY/GSTBench.

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于配置优先的框架，用于评估深度学习系统在不同后端（CPU、GPU和编译运行时）的兼容性，并通过三层次验证协议量化漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习系统在不同后端部署时存在兼容性问题，缺乏统一的评估和缓解方法。

Method: 使用YAML解耦实验与代码，支持库和仓库模型，采用三层次验证协议（张量级接近度、激活对齐和任务级指标）。

Result: 在672次检查中，72.0%的运行通过，检测模型和编译后端易出现漂移，确定性适配器和选择性回退可显著改善一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次系统量化并缓解跨后端漂移，为异构运行时部署提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在解决高维可靠性问题时具有高计算效率和强预测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高维可靠性分析中的维度灾难问题，同时保持了预测精度和计算效率。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共交通工具的到达时间预测对乘客体验和交通管理至关重要，但非平稳数据会降低模型性能。

Method: NSATP方法包括两个阶段：序列平稳化和非平稳性效应恢复，通过二维模型和补偿模块捕捉隐藏周期性。

Result: 实验显示，NSATP在电车和公交车的RMSE、MAE和MAPE上分别降低了2.37%、1.22%、2.26%和1.72%、0.60%、1.17%。

Conclusion: NSATP在多步ATP中有效平衡了可预测性和非平稳性，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在基础推理任务上表现优异，但在需要与外部工具交互的任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种能够提升多轮工具使用能力的框架。

Method: RLFactory采用异步调用器和解耦的工具/训练架构解决工具调用的稳定性和适应性问题，并通过奖励层支持多种评估需求。它通过引入观察标记和动态策略优化工作流（生成-解析-调用-更新）来重构MDP。

Result: 在Search-R1和Qwen3-4B上，RLFactory在Natural Questions数据集上的测试得分为0.486，超过了使用类似技术训练的更大模型（如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO的0.473），并将训练吞吐量提高了6.8倍。

Conclusion: RLFactory提供了一个低门槛、高适应性的框架，能够有效提升大语言模型在现实场景中的多轮工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARE框架通过实时安全监控、回滚机制和自省干预策略，在解码时实现安全对齐，平衡安全性与响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在现实应用中的安全性至关重要，现有方法在安全性和响应质量之间存在严重权衡。

Method: CARE框架包含三个关键组件：实时安全监控的守卫模型、高效回滚机制和自省干预策略。

Result: 实验表明，CARE在安全性、质量和效率上取得优越平衡，有害响应率低且用户体验干扰最小。

Conclusion: CARE为解码时安全对齐提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了安全性与响应质量的平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

TL;DR: FediLoRA是一个针对异构LoRA秩和缺失模态的联邦多模态微调框架，通过维度聚合和轻量级模型编辑提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法假设统一秩配置和单模态输入，忽略了异构资源和多模态数据的挑战。

Method: 提出维度聚合策略和轻量级模型编辑方法，优化LoRA更新和局部模型修复。

Result: 在三个多模态基准数据集上表现优于基线，尤其在模态缺失情况下。

Conclusion: FediLoRA在异构资源和多模态场景下有效提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地重现流行病曲线，适用于快速且实用的模型校准，已在R中实现并验证。

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Method: 使用LPCMCI框架和GPDC分析1970-2021年的季度数据，结合Chronos框架进行零样本预测。

Result: 发现经济增长对GDP的单向因果联系，失业率预测准确且提供90%置信区间。

Conclusion: 因果结构学习与概率语言模型结合可增强经济预测和政策制定的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

*Serra Aksoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文比较了CNN和视觉Transformer在光伏热故障检测中的性能，并通过XRAI分析验证了模型决策与热物理原理的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光伏监测中AI模型决策缺乏物理验证的问题，以提升其在能源基础设施中的应用。

Method: 使用ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0、ViT-Tiny和Swin-Tiny模型，结合XRAI显著性分析，评估模型决策与热物理原理的匹配度。

Result: Swin Transformer表现最佳（94%二元准确率；73%多类准确率），XRAI分析显示模型学习了物理相关特征，但不同故障类型性能差异显著。

Conclusion: 热物理指导的可解释性方法为能源监测中的AI决策验证提供了方法论，有助于克服可再生能源基础设施中的部署障碍。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维线性映射在现代深度学习模型中占据大量参数和计算成本，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过可训练的低维多变量函数实现高维映射，采用样条查找表实现高效计算。

Result: lmKANs在多个基准测试中显著降低推理FLOPs，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: lmKANs是一种高效的高维映射替代方案，适用于多种深度学习任务。

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的欧几里得归一化层不适用于流形数据，而许多黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，可以扩展神经网络到非欧几里得领域。

Method: 提出了GyroBN框架，基于伪约简和陀螺等距陀螺两个条件，确保对样本统计的理论控制。

Result: 在七种代表性几何（如Grassmannian、常曲率空间等）上验证了GyroBN的有效性。

Conclusion: GyroBN为黎曼流形上的批量归一化提供了理论支持和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at
https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/GyroBN.git.

TL;DR: TabGFM将图数据转换为表格形式，利用表格基础模型进行零样本节点分类，显著提升了泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型在真实图数据上泛化性能不足，而表格基础模型在其他领域表现优异，因此尝试将图问题转化为表格问题。

Method: 通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格，应用多个表格基础模型进行多样化子采样，并通过集成选择聚合输出。

Result: 在28个真实数据集上，TabGFM优于任务特定GNN和最先进的图基础模型。

Conclusion: 表格化重构为可扩展和泛化的图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对Transformer Circuits行为连贯性的单次量化评估。

Result: 提出了EICS评分方法，并提供了实际应用指南和计算开销分析。

Conclusion: EICS是一种白盒、单次评估方法，适用于量化Transformer Circuits的连贯性。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Result: 生成的结构在稳定性和新颖性上比现有方法提高50%，空间群条件生成效果提升50%。

Conclusion: PLaID++展示了将NLP技术应用于材料设计的潜力，为高效新材料发现铺平道路。

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

TL;DR: Fed-REACT是一个针对异构和动态数据的联邦学习框架，通过两阶段方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据分布异构和动态变化导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 结合表示学习和进化聚类，分两阶段训练：客户端学习本地表示，服务器动态聚类并训练任务特定模型。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Fed-REACT有效应对数据异构和动态变化，提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

Method: 分析量化对权重和激活的影响，研究其对网络性能的影响，并提出混合精度QAT结合数据集采样和加权损失函数的方法。

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加和群体准确率下降，影响梯度和Hessian矩阵特征值。

Conclusion: 混合精度QAT结合数据集采样和加权损失函数可缓解量化对少数群体的不公平影响。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an

optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced

discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为逆问题提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效学习复杂哈密顿流形，适用于保守、耗散和端口哈密顿系统。

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

Conclusion: ALICE为组合复杂领域提供了泛化和可解释性的新见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based

automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

*Li-Chin Chen,Ji-Tian Sheu,Yuh-Jue Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用人口统计预训练（GDP）模型，用于学习年龄和性别的基础表示，提升临床风险分层和治疗的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口统计属性在电子健康记录中普遍存在且重要，但现有模型设计中对其表示学习关注不足。

Method: 通过预训练GDP模型，结合排序策略和编码方法，将表格人口统计数据转换为潜在嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，GDP模型显著提升了模型性能，尤其在年龄和性别对风险分层贡献大的疾病中。

Conclusion: GDP模型可泛化到不同任务和人群，为医疗预测性能提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

TL;DR: FedTeddi是一种针对动态数据演化的联邦边缘学习调度算法，通过量化时间漂移和集体差异，优化调度和带宽分配，实现快速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中客户端数据随时间变化且非独立同分布，现有研究假设静态数据集，无法适应动态数据演化。

Method: 提出FedTeddi算法，利用时间漂移和集体差异（通过EMD量化），设计联合调度和带宽分配优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，FedTeddi在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上分别比随机调度收敛速度快58.4%和49.2%，测试精度更高。

Conclusion: FedTeddi能有效适应动态数据演化，提升联邦边缘学习的收敛速度和模型性能。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

TL;DR: SBS通过两种技术抑制频谱偏差，提升神经网络的神经表示效果，实现更高精度的参数压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多层感知器在神经网络表示中存在频谱偏差，影响高频细节重建。

Method: 采用单向排序平滑和随机傅里叶特征技术，自适应调整输入编码频率带宽。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，SBS以更少参数实现优于现有技术的重建精度。

Conclusion: SBS是一种高效的神经网络表示增强方法，显著提升参数压缩和重建性能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where

equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the
computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods
making it a useful choice for diverse applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的框架DPH-RL，通过使用mass-covering f-divergences来解决RLVR中多尝试性能下降和灾难性遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RLVR中，尽管单次尝试准确性提高，但多尝试性能常下降，且伴随灾难性遗忘。现有方法未充分研究分歧项的作用。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，利用mass-covering f-divergences（如forward-KL和JS-divergence）作为知识保留机制。

Result: 实验表明DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k下降问题，还提高了域内外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 选择合适的分歧度量是改进RLVR的关键工具，能构建更通用和多样化的推理模型。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上实现最优性能，同时提供额外的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该模型在推荐任务中表现出色，且具备理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Result: 在真实DMA数据上测试，MAPE最大提升4.9%，并识别出社会经济因素影响的用户行为。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了短期水需求预测精度，并为理解需求模式提供了新视角。

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Conclusion: RoseCDL将卷积字典学习扩展为实际事件发现和表征的工具，超越了传统的压缩或去噪任务。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ΔL Normalization的损失聚合方法，用于解决RLVR中动态生成长度导致的梯度方差大和优化不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升大型语言模型推理能力方面表现出潜力，但训练中响应长度的大幅变化导致梯度方差高和优化不稳定。现有方法如GRPO、DAPO等存在偏差或梯度方差问题。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析动态长度对策略损失的影响，将问题重新表述为寻找最小方差无偏估计，提出ΔL Normalization方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同模型规模、最大长度和任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ΔL Normalization不仅提供了无偏的策略损失估计，还理论上最小化了梯度方差，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Conclusion: uGMM-NN为现代神经网络引入不确定性感知组件奠定了基础，拓展了判别与生成模型的新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

Conclusion: 双公式PINN框架通过提供误差界限和收敛质量指示，增强了在微力学均匀化问题中的适用性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Motivation: IG适用于连续数据，但不适用于离散的图结构，因此需要一种适用于图的解释性方法。

Method: 提出了GB-IG，扩展了IG以适用于图数据。

Result: 在合成数据集上准确识别关键结构，在真实数据集上优于IG。

Conclusion: GB-IG是图数据解释的有效工具。

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

TL;DR: IBN提出了一种可解释的双向建模网络，结合不确定性感知插值和图卷积，提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理缺失变量时缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式，IBN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: IBN集成了不确定性感知插值（UAI）和高斯核图卷积（GGCN），并采用双向递归单元增强时间依赖性建模。

Result: 实验表明IBN在不同缺失率场景下均达到最优预测性能。

Conclusion: IBN为缺失变量的多变量时间序列预测提供了更可靠且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出使用误差有损压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩MoE模型中未激活的专家模块，以减少数据传输开销，并分析了不同专家层的压缩误差对推理准确性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GPU内存受限的情况下，高效服务MoE模型是一个挑战。将未激活的专家模块卸载到主内存是一种解决方案，但带来了数据传输的挑战。

Method: 采用误差有损压缩算法压缩未激活的专家模块，并通过实验分析不同专家层的压缩误差对推理准确性的影响。

Result: 浅层专家对推理准确性影响较小，中层专家误差显著降低准确性，而深层专家误差有时能提高准确性。

Conclusion: 误差有损压缩是减少MoE模型数据传输开销的有效方法，但需根据不同专家层的特点调整压缩策略。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available
OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化联合药物筛选提供了更有效的早期决策路径。

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Motivation: 传统EEG设备虽准确但不便，限制了在家庭等实际场景中的应用。耳内EEG设备可能提供一种舒适、低干扰的解决方案。

Method: 通过11名参与者的睡眠研究，使用定制耳塞和干耳尖电极采集信号，并与Apple Watch Ultra的睡眠分期结果进行对比。

Result: 系统在二元睡眠检测（清醒vs.睡眠）中达到90.5%准确率，四类分期（清醒、REM、核心、深度）中达到65.1%准确率。

Conclusion: 耳内电极是一种低干扰、舒适的睡眠监测方法，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了大规模多任务学习的潜力，兼具高效性和性能。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

### [136] [ACE and Diverse Generalization via Selective Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07955)
*Oliver Daniels,Stuart Armstrong,Alexandre Maranhão,Mahirah Fairuz Rahman,Benjamin M. Marlin,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ACE的方法，通过自训练解决深度神经网络在完全虚假相关性下的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到虚假相关性的影响，尤其是在完全虚假相关性下，正确的泛化是未定义的。

Method: 使用自训练方法学习一组概念，这些概念在训练数据上一致，但在未标记的新输入上做出不同预测。

Result: ACE在完全虚假相关性基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并在语言模型对齐中取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: ACE在解决泛化未定义问题上取得了重要进展，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于高秩结构化矩阵的新评分函数，解决标准注意力机制的信息损失和计算偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影导致信息损失，且缺乏距离相关的计算偏差。

Method: 使用Block Tensor-Train (BTT)和Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR)矩阵设计高效评分函数。

Result: 在高维输入任务和语言建模中表现优于标准注意力，MLR在长时序预测中也有潜力。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于更广泛的高效结构化矩阵家族，能解决标准注意力的关键缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

TL;DR: 学习率预热是一种在大规模深度神经网络训练中常用的技术，本文通过提出一种新的广义平滑性假设，从理论上验证了其加速收敛的效果。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管学习率预热在实践中取得了巨大成功，但其理论优势尚未完全理解，本文旨在填补这一理论与实践的差距。

Method: 提出了一种新的广义平滑性假设，并在确定性和随机设置下研究了梯度下降（GD）的收敛性质。

Result: 研究表明，学习率预热能显著加速GD收敛，在某些特定情况下，预热学习率比非递增学习率快Θ(T)倍。

Conclusion: 本文从优化理论的角度提供了学习率预热策略的理论依据，解释了其在实际中的优势。

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

Result: 在1-DoF、2-DoF和双臂任务中，比经典优化器（如Nelder Mead）提速高达93倍。

Conclusion: 建立了量子原生框架，有效连接量子计算与机器人运动学优化。

Abstract: Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching
complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally
challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native
framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to
solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum
circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then
constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm
leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity.
Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method
achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder
Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational,
quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging
quantum computing and robotics problems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态环境下的感知引导间隙规划器（dynamic gap），通过跟踪自由空间的间隙并预测其动态，结合间隙传播算法和追踪引导理论，生成理想条件下可证明无碰撞的轨迹。


<details>

Motivation: 现有动态环境中的感知引导局部规划器多依赖经验性鲁棒性而非动态障碍物的正式分析，本文旨在通过明确处理动态障碍物来提升规划性能。

Method: 1. 跟踪自由空间的间隙并估计其动态；2. 通过间隙传播算法预测未来可行区域；3. 利用追踪引导理论生成无碰撞轨迹；4. 在无间隙时进行障碍物中心处理。

Conclusion: 动态间隙规划器通过系统处理动态障碍物，显著提升了动态环境中的规划性能，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a point-cloud-based navigation
stack, MUONS, for autonomous off-road navigation. Performance is characterized
by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation
and validated through field testing. Our simulation campaign considers three
kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98
success rate and experienced no failures in the field. By statistical and
correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the
proportional variation due to changes in the tuning parameters is remarkably
well correlated to performance in field testing. This finding supports the use
of Monte-Carlo simulation campaigns for performance assessment and parameter
tuning.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental
task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While
imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness
on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint
changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser
scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual
localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of
ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1)
the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth
generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3)
limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under
aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from
mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and
San Francisco.

Conclusion: TransMPC在复杂系统中实现了高精度实时控制，兼具计算效率和适应性。

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from
excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment.
Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control
policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on
simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for
complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based
explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences
in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC
policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention,
enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward
pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while
ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy
optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases.
Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal
trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via
automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay
buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training
samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon
lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments
validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy,
adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential
capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods
are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined
models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the
above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,
existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training
efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are
equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper
develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a
risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a
safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting
areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.
The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding
vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during
training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold
channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.
Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions
with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation
results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak
reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky
areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley
collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to
improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the
collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a
Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking
maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized
queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces
significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental
disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active
infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting
conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and
visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented
with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable
docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the
robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high
docking accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了及时性与信息量之间的权衡关系，为优化时间关键场景中的人机交互提供了新方向。

Abstract: In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on
alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues
usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses
independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning.
Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by
context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g.,
social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while
overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human
comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing
considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays
can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off
between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential
decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We
design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline
taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable
taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic
humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to
methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and
informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these
two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in
time-critical human-AI assistance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

Abstract: Birds in nature perform perching not only for rest but also for interaction
with human such as the relationship with falconers. Recently, researchers
achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable
structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and
compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains
challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling
flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high
compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable
aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping
ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,
we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm
and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to
remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.
We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation
while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing
interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the
structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify
sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control
remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype
demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well
as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions
during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve
an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.

TL;DR: OmniMap是一个实时在线映射框架，首次同时捕捉光学、几何和语义场景属性，解决了现有方法的模糊、不规则和语义模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D环境感知中只能部分满足光学、几何和语义需求，存在模糊、不规则和语义模糊等问题。

Method: OmniMap采用3DGS-Voxel混合表示，结合自适应相机建模、混合增量表示和概率融合等创新技术。

Result: 实验表明，OmniMap在渲染保真度、几何精度和零样本语义分割方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniMap的多样性和高效性使其适用于多种下游应用，如场景问答、交互编辑和导航。

Abstract: Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception,
requiring simultaneous capture of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise
layout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic).
Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these
requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and
semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall,
OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously
captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining
real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level,
OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that
combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation
level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and
introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and
exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal
constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.
Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering
fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is
further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including
multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,
and map-assisted navigation.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在自碰撞检测中比传统几何方法更高效。

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the integration of positional encoding -- a
technique widely used in computer graphics -- into the input vector of a binary
classification model for self-collision detection. The results demonstrate the
benefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification
accuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,
leading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision
patterns. The manuscript shows that machine learning-based techniques, such as
lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) operating in a low-dimensional
feature space, offer a faster alternative for collision checking than
traditional methods that rely on geometric approaches, such as
triangle-to-triangle intersection tests and Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)
for mesh-based models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SSD-Mamba2的跨模态强化学习框架，用于高效、可扩展的运动控制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制器在感知-动作策略上存在计算-内存权衡问题，且难以处理长时程依赖。

Method: 使用SSD-Mamba2作为骨干网络，结合状态空间对偶性，实现高效的长时程依赖建模。

Result: 在多种运动控制场景中，性能优于现有方法，且训练更快、更安全。

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2为高效、可扩展的运动控制提供了实用的融合骨干。

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Conclusion: RobKiNet在复杂约束下表现优异，适用于实际机器人任务。

Abstract: In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the
robot's configuration space to meet task-level global constraints and enhance
the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Due to the complexity of joint
configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often
lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a
kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the
Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration
space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with
traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29
times faster and a sampling accuracy of up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% task
completion rate in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data
transmission.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了机器人系统的透明度和可信度，支持更广泛的因果查询。

Abstract: Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.
In particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a
particular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.
Behaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of
robots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is
whether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering
"why" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior
attention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual
explanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically
generates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive "why"
questions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal
model from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge
about the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model
is then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual
explanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the
behaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being
able to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step
towards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic
systems.

Abstract: We address ego-motion estimation for automated parking, where

Traditional methods using inertial-measurement units and wheel encoders require

contributions include a Doppler-augmented radar SLAM method, multi-radar

demonstrate high-accuracy localization and improved robustness over

Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control
framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with
a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing
the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired
altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical
applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic
Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the
challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a
model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high
computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid
computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge
arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With
modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were
trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also
achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the
robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were
conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and
underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A
comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their
potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.

Conclusion: SPERO的创新设计克服了停止旋翼飞行器的长期挑战，为未来类似飞行器提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight
regimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile
delivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate
vertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the
stop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,
practical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and
stability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO
(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a
flipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust
vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state
machine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller
reconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and
control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome
longstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,
bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in unstructured environments require the ability to
switch between compliant and rigid states to perform diverse tasks such as
adaptive grasping, high-force manipulation, shape holding, and navigation in
constrained spaces, among others. However, many existing variable stiffness
solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or
monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper
presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that
achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints
actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm
states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high
stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under
high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into
reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We
validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness
gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;
and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves
shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These
results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for
programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable
morphology and task-adaptive interaction.

Result: RaC在真实和模拟任务中表现优于现有方法，数据收集时间减少10倍。

Conclusion: RaC显著提升机器人策略的效率和鲁棒性，且性能随恢复行为数量线性扩展。

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

Conclusion: GF-VLA展示了在多样空间和语义变化下的强泛化能力和鲁棒性，为机器人技能学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a
significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level
trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,
spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we
introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that
enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution
directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an
information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively
highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues
are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently
integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance
efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy
that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit
geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly
benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial
generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation
achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the
language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When
deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%
placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,
letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong
generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Abstract: Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.
