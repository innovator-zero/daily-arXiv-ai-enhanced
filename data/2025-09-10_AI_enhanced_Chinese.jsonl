We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP\ndataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in\nboth batch integration and biological signal preservation.

Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend\nto be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an\nalternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A\ngenerator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,\nand a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the\nplanner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started\nwith the next-best grasp as the target and so on.

Existing perception-informed local planners\nthat operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical\nrobustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of\ndynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses\ndynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar\nregions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are\nestimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.\nThen, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap\npropagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.\nLastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories\nthat are provably collision-free under ideal conditions.

Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic\ndata, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for\nurban traffic demand forecasting.

Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where\nprocedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice\nthickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent\nconfounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We\nconsider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but\nclinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized\nembeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image\nfeatures using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol\nprediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health\nsystems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT\ntriage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph\ncardiomegaly detection.

Deep learning\nhas demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model\nnon-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data\nwill degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint\ndistribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied\nnormalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby\nachieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful\ncharacteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the\nover-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and\nnon-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (\nNSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization\nand non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the\npredictability.

However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as\nContrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and\nresponse quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for\ndecoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a\nguard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially\nunsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe\noutputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;\nand (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model\ngenerates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates\nthese reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The\nframework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model\nfor precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and\nour novel introspection method for effective self-correction.

This challenge is exacerbated by\nthe unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and\nperception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving\nuncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners\ndegrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter\nserious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected\nmaneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency\ntrajectory optimization framework in this paper.

These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory\noptimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the\nuncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without\nresorting to excessive conservatism.

This design allows the robot's arms to\nremain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.\nWe also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation\nwhile integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing\ninteraction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the\nstructural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify\nsufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control\nremain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype\ndemonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well\nas the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions\nduring flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve\nan aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8eab\u4e0a\u6816\u606f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6293\u63e1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53d8\u5f62\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u98de\u884c\u548c\u6816\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u4fa7\u67d4\u6027\u81c2\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u5145\u6c14\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6c14\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u673a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8eab\u4e0a\u67d4\u6027\u6816\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u63a8\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6816\u606f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002"}}

However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry\nmodeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture\nsynthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end\nPBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter\n(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR\nmaterials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel\nperspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.\nSpecifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV\ndiffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,\nenabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple\ndiffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns\nmultiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D\nGaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated\npost-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh\nassets from the resulting 2DGS.

To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that\nenables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution\ndirectly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an\ninformation-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively\nhighlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues\nare structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently\nintegrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical\nbehavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance\nefficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy\nthat autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit\ngeometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly\nbenchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial\ngeneralization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation\nachieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the\nlanguage-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies.

Key innovations that make our approach\neffective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for\nsimultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a\nsignificant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic\ndifferentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and\nearly-stopping mechanism for robust offline training.

The findings suggest that foundational\nmodels for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and\npopulations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive\nperformance in healthcare applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08GDP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GDP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGDP\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u8d21\u732e\u5927\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "GDP\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,\nwe design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes\nGaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and\nTanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction\naccuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiGS\u5c06SDF\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u51653DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "DiGS\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5173\u8054\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SDF\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u589e\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDiGS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "DiGS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408SDF\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a3DGS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model\nvulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.\nAlthough current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or\ndirectly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic\nfeatures and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,\ntheir reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to\ngradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example\nquality.

However, relying solely on 2D boxes\nintroduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to\nmultiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single\nviewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,\na novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data\nto address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point\nclouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as\npossible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher\nnetwork learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally\naggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality\npseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for\nboth static and moving objects.

The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the\npolicy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from\nits diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:\nusing the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,\nDiversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences\n(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By\ncontinuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to\nmaintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is\nmore training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator\nfunctions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online\nreference model.

For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this\npaper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to\naddress this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT\nimages, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention\nconvolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention\nrollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean\ncurvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in\ncombination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed\nedges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also\nyielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based\nexplanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose\noptimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and\ndistance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase\nwith 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.\nThe CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps\ncan enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions.

In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers.

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely\non target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in\ncomplex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and\nbackground discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video\nbackgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable\npriors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and\nsparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the\nbackground, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on\nthese insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires\nminimal assumptions about target characteristics.

This mechanism captures both local\nand non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying\non explicit iterative optimization.

To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted\nMulti-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework\nutilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of\nmultiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution\nestimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts\nimage features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different\nregions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique\nstatistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture\nlikelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves\nstate-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and\ndecoding latency.

Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and\n25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high\n(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address\nthis issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage\nin order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D\nintracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age\nand the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and\nmultimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection\n(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a\nsubsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse\npatients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:\n0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal\nXSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to\nmodality contribution measures.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient\nand explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of\nhair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level\nhair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline\nfirst reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian\nrasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands\nthrough a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under\nphotometric supervision.\n  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the\ngeometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair\nstrands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a\nproxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient\nreconstruction, typically completing within one hour.\n  The project page can be found at: https://yimin-pan.github.io/hair-gs/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5934\u53d1\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u62d3\u6251\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5934\u53d1\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5934\u53d1\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u6805\u5316\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5934\u53d1\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u6bb5\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5934\u53d1\u4e1d\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5728\u5149\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u751f\u957f\u5934\u53d1\u4e1d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u53d1\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u57281\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5934\u53d1\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative\nRepresentation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target\nsemantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.\nThis mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances\nresilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within\nLLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation\nDecoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying\nLLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving\ncomprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments\nshow that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and\n+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains\nacross 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7OcDR\u548cGRD\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u4e0e3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cLLMs\u4e0e3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bOcDR\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\uff09\u548cGRD\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetv2\u548cMulti3DRefer\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPLM\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.3\u548c6.0 mIoU\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "PLM\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in\nsingle-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous\nenvironments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often\nconstrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address\nthese challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the\noverall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces\non extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by\nmitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,\n\\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load\nacross the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \\textit{dynamic\nparameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA\nadapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge\nretention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks\nsuch as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying\nexclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains\nperformance on par with specialized single-task baselines.

In this paper, we\nintroduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces\ndiffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By\nharnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion\nmodel can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given\nthe image observation and object feature.

By explicitly enforcing this\nalignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details\nfrom the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual\nknowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex\nvisual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all\ntasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying\nour framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction\nfor the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIRAL\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVIRAL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50MLLMs\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVIRAL\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "VIRAL\u4e3aMLLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
