We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a\nContinual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that\nincrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining\nknowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely\non unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological\nevolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.\nSimultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow\nfor the real-time performance of DFD systems.

Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language\nexpressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.\nMoreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both\nobject grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object\nGrounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets\nopen-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target\nobjects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated\nobject instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp\nSynthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp\nAffordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp\nannotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion\nmodule and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,\nimproving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that\nOGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial\nlanguage instructions.

VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,\neach processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating\nthe output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a\nricher set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We\ntheoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla\nscaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving\nperformance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various\nmodel architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and\nEventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves\nperformance.

The\ndataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process\nhigh-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a\ndataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered\nby the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very\ndiverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity\nof the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts\nand missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to\nsolve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training\nand validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to\navoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical\nimage patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were\noriginally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the\ndataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide\nstatistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial\ndistribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and\nmore.

Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising\nperformance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,\nexisting methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness\nand noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework\nbased on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.\nTechnically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and\nincrease the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to\nachieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in\neach module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature\nextraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,\na noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex\nnoise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a\nchannel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different\nfeatures across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while\nmaintaining both lightweightness and robustness.

To address this, physical layer compressive measurement\nhas been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video\nSnapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the\noptical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling\nstrategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is\nrandomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated\nthat images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by\nI2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial\nlocation, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then\nbuild a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the\neffectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS\nmeasurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to\nrecover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and\nCCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we\npropose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,\nglobal Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity\nof the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data\nshow that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

A significant challenge\nwith these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring\nthe classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D\napplications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in\nimage-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called\nE3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes\nwithout relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL\ntackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty\nestimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction\nprobabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for\npointwise prediction uncertainty.

Critical to this\nsuccess are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens\nbased on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal\nstructures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of\ninduction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and\nlearn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal\nstructure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the\nrelationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our\nframework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with\ndifferent lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting\nunveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows\ntransformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure\nin-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism\nto predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the\ncorresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a\n3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a\ntheoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to\nthe maximum likelihood solution.

State-of-the-art\nmethods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the\nmultiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement\nmodules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key\nlimitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that\neither focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,\nor cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class\ninstances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial\nbackground class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic\ngap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during\noptimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we\nfirst design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which\nutilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo\nGT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between\nadjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic\ndetection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class\nrepresentation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap\nbetween matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss\non ignored proposals to accelerate convergence.

For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the\nclients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round\ncommunication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of\nclipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee\nclient-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the\nprivacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for\nmoderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the\noriginal GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM\nto FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish\ntheoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a\nlogarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$.

In\naddition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic\nfeature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from\nbystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most\nimportantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our\npath-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by\nclustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to\nlocalize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally\ncluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient\nto noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an\nextended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP\nwith other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.\nHowever, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP\noutperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence\nand velocity jumps.

However, maintaining\nconsistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to\nviewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to\ntracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a\nunified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.\nHowever, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density\ncaused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the\nquality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking\naccuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that\ncombines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it\napplies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during\nprojection.

Recent\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object\nrecognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities\nthat align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,\nit remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social\nnavigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents\nand human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot\nnavigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social\nrobot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to\nmeet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social\nNavigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene\nunderstanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB\nprovides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based\nbaselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social\nreasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art\nVLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging\nprobability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler\nrule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in\nsocial scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for\nfurther research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a\nframework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot\nnavigation needs.

We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning\ndiffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.\nJM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety\nfilters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional\ngeneration is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by\ncomparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.\nMore details at: https://jm2d-corl25.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "JM2D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "JM2D\u5c06\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u52bf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "JM2D\u5728\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JM2D\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u662f\u5176\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU\nmemory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.\nOffloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to\nalleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache\nconfiguration.

To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:\nperturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to\nconstruct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and\ncan be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying\nparameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient\nto train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a\ntheoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild\nassumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic\noptimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.\nWe validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,\neven in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PFL\uff09\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DFL\uff09\u5404\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1aPFL\u5ffd\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cDFL\u56e0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u5766\u800c\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3cSigmoid\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4efb\u4f55DFL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9057\u61be\u503c\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8ePFL\u548cDFL\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In this work, we present HuMo, a\nunified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first\nchallenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,\nreference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage\nprogressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies.

Furthermore, we extend\nLADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation\nmasks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,\nshowcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.\nUltimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world\ndomain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly\nor incomplete.", "AI": {"tldr": "LADB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6e90\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u6865\uff08LADB\uff09\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LADM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "LADB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,\nbut as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due\nto fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can\nsimultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel\nsecure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather\nthan a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's\ndata by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding\naccuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs\nsimilarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect\nprivacy.

Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides\ncritical insights into complex behaviors and failures.

We propose a method that labels log data\nwithout manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of\nanomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies\ninto three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,\nAnomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a\nflexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,\nand supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show\nF1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third\nlayer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,\ntheir origin, and event sequences.

Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and image-to-video generation.

Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach.

This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals.

The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects.

Besides, MoT\nconsistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive\nmulti-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating\noverfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level\nteachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general\nreasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating\nthat consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly.
