Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source
code and trained models are publicly available at:

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉扩散模型（VDM）和Transformer的方法，用于实现跨物种、视角和上下文的人类动作识别，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在跨物种、视角和上下文的动作识别任务中泛化能力不足，无法像人类一样灵活识别动作。

Method: 使用视觉扩散模型生成特征，并通过Transformer聚合这些特征，同时利用扩散过程的早期时间步条件来突出语义信息。

Result: 模型在跨物种、视角和上下文的动作识别任务中均达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了动作识别的泛化能力，使其更接近人类水平的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

### [3] [PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910)
*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术主动防止LLM生成有害信息，结合数据驱动的对比学习和多目标优化，减少25-30%的危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法从源头预防有害输出，尤其是对弱势群体（如LGBTQ+、单亲家庭等）的风险。

Method: 提出VulnGuard Prompt，整合少量示例、伦理链式推理和自适应角色提示，通过多目标优化和熵边界理论减少危害。

Result: 理论验证显示危害减少25-30%，并通过GitHub数据集建立了系统研究的数学基础。

Conclusion: PromptGuard为实时预防LLM有害输出提供了系统化解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Beta-SOD的统计异常检测框架，用于解决Re-ID任务中的标签噪声问题，通过混合Beta分布建模相似性分布，结合多种损失函数优化特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID方法对标签噪声敏感，导致性能下降，因此需要一种鲁棒的去噪方法。

Method: 采用Siamese网络架构，结合Beta-SOD框架建模相似性分布，使用交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失联合优化。

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，Beta-SOD在10-30%噪声水平下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Beta-SOD在去噪和Re-ID任务中表现出鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFD-Mamba2Net的端到端框架，用于提高ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICA图像的低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构对现有分割和检测方法提出了挑战，需要更精确的解决方案。

Method: 结合多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，设计了CASE模块和PHFP模块。

Result: 在八个分割指标上优于现有方法，狭窄检测的阳性预测值和真阳性率最高。

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net在ICA图像的分割和狭窄检测中表现出色，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自动化框架，结合分割和放射组学技术，用于预测结直肠肝转移（CRLM）患者的手术结果，显著优于现有临床和基因组生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌肝转移（CRLM）的手术预后预测模型目前基于有限的临床或分子特征，预测能力不足，尤其是在多灶性CRLM病例中。

Method: 框架包括分割管道（利用SAMONAI算法完成部分标注数据的3D分割）和放射组学管道（使用SurvAMINN模型进行生存分析）。

Result: 在227名患者的机构数据集上，该框架的C-index提高了10%以上，优于现有生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了自动化分割算法与放射组学生存分析结合在CRLM预后预测中的潜力，具有高效、准确和可解释的特点。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

### [7] [Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)
*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon是一种进化搜索算法，用于发现两个文本到图像模型中视觉属性的差异及其触发提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型在视觉表示上的差异，揭示模型间的潜在偏差和特性。

Method: 引入CompCon算法，通过进化搜索发现模型间的视觉属性差异，并构建ID2数据集进行评估。

Result: CompCon成功识别出模型间的差异，如PixArt和Stable Diffusion 3.5在特定提示下的不同表现。

Conclusion: CompCon能有效揭示模型间的视觉表示差异，为模型比较和偏差分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

### [8] [An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949)
*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于U-Net的深度学习模型，用于识别和修复无人机图像中的云阴影和太阳耀光，以提高水质参数估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像在云阴影和太阳耀光的影响下难以准确估计水质参数，因此需要一种有效的方法来修复这些干扰区域。

Method: 使用U-Net深度学习模型，从像素级数据中训练模型，并通过评估指标确定最佳训练设置，最终修复图像中的干扰区域。

Result: 研究成功开发了一种高质量的图像修复模型，能够有效恢复受云阴影和太阳耀光影响的区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机图像处理提供了一种有效的解决方案，有助于提高水质参数估计的准确性。

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin结合卷积和Transformer，通过局部-全局特征融合提升小数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs在全局建模上表现优异，但在小数据集中缺乏局部特征提取能力。

Method: 提出CoSwin，集成局部特征增强模块到注意力块中，结合卷积和Transformer。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能优于Swin Transformer，如CIFAR-10提升2.17%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合能有效提升Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部和全局一致性学习提升配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，提升配准精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 结合局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习，通过双边匹配和最近邻搜索优化置信矩阵。

Result: 在KITTI、KITTI-360和3DMatch等数据集上达到SOTA性能，内点率高达97%。

Conclusion: iMatcher在多样场景下表现出色，显著提升了点云配准的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于占用表示的方法UltrON，利用超声图像中的声学特征改进弱监督优化下的几何一致性，解决了遮挡和标注依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖精确标注且难以处理超声图像的视角依赖性和声影伪影，限制了3D重建的准确性。

Method: 采用占用表示，结合声学特征和新型损失函数，优化多视角超声图像的几何一致性。

Result: UltrON减少了遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提升了3D重建的准确性。

Conclusion: UltrON为超声图像的3D重建提供了更准确的解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

*Andrew Bell,Yan Kit Choi,Steffen Peterson,Andrew King,Muhummad Sohaib Nazir,Alistair Young*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INRs）的方法，用于自动量化心肌运动和应变，无需推理时间优化，在准确性和速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动量化心肌运动和应变在标记MRI中是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法在准确性和效率上存在不足。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INRs）结合学习到的潜在代码，预测连续的左心室位移。

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，该方法实现了最佳跟踪精度（2.14 mm RMSE）和最低的全局周向（2.86%）和径向（6.42%）应变误差，速度比最准确的基线快约380倍。

Conclusion: INR模型适用于大规模CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析。

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet通过动态加权策略改进MLNet，专注于相关类别边界，显著提升已知和未知类别的区分能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MLNet）对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，无法有效区分已知和未知类别。

Method: 提出E-MLNet，集成动态加权策略到OEM中，利用闭集分类器的预测，专注于每个目标样本最相关的类别边界。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，E-MLNet在VisDA和ImageCLEF上取得最高平均H分数，并在多数任务中优于MLNet。

Conclusion: E-MLNet的动态加权策略显著提升了模型性能，验证了其聚焦适应策略的有效性。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu是一个大规模乌尔都语图像-字幕数据集，旨在填补乌尔都语在多模态研究中的空白，并通过质量评估框架确保数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语在多模态研究中资源匮乏，导致多语言视觉语言模型存在偏见。COCO-Urdu旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 数据集基于MS COCO，通过分层抽样和翻译（SeamlessM4T v2）生成，并使用混合质量评估框架（COMET-Kiwi、CLIP、BERTScore）验证和优化。

Result: COCO-Urdu包含59,000张图像和319,000条字幕，质量评估结果显示其性能优异。

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu为减少语言偏见提供了基础，并推动了包容性视觉语言系统的发展。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Motivation: 现有fMRI视觉解码方法依赖主体特定训练，限制了可扩展性和实际部署。

Method: VoxelFormer结合Token Merging Transformer（ToMer）和Q-Former，实现高效体素压缩和固定大小神经表示。

Result: 在7T Natural Scenes Dataset上，VoxelFormer在训练主体上表现出竞争性检索性能，参数更少。

Conclusion: Token合并和基于查询的Transformer是参数高效神经解码的有效策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: PCGM通过结合解剖学约束和扩散模型，生成高质量的反事实脑MRI，成功复现了疾病对大脑皮层的细微影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D脑MRI研究中，视觉难以检测的细微形态差异需要高质量的反事实图像生成，但现有模型缺乏解剖学细节的保留能力。

Method: 提出PCGM，通过概率图模块捕捉解剖学约束，生成空间二值掩码，结合ControlNet和扩散模型生成高质量MRI。

Result: PCGM生成的MRI质量优于基线方法，并能复现疾病对大脑皮层的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM是研究脑形态差异的重要里程碑，为合成MRI的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Conclusion: Med3DInsight为无需人工标注的可扩展多模态3D医学表示学习提供了新范式，并可无缝集成到现有网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Motivation: 现有图卷积神经网络（GCNs）在人机交互动作识别中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏场景信息的有效表示和合适的学习架构。

Method: 通过引入固定物体信息和多任务学习架构，改进动作识别模型。

Result: 在真实数据集上测试，准确率达到99.25%，比仅使用人体骨架的基线模型提高了2.75%。

Conclusion: 结合场景信息和多任务学习能有效提升人机交互动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态特征对比和筛选策略的创新特征融合框架IRDFusion，显著提升了多光谱目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征融合中常保留多余背景或噪声，限制了感知性能。

Method: 设计了MFRM和DFFM模块，通过迭代关系图差分引导特征融合机制（IRDFusion）实现自适应特征增强与噪声抑制。

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M$^3$FD数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代反馈显著提升了跨模态融合质量，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有VLA压缩方法无法同时实现量化和令牌剪枝，导致效率提升受限。

Method: 通过协同设计量化和令牌剪枝流程，提出量化感知的令牌剪枝标准，并优化量化器设计。

Result: SQAP-VLA实现了1.93倍加速，平均成功率提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA在保持模型性能的同时，显著提升了VLA模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc展示了自监督方法的潜力，为LiDAR定位提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,

occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种高效、无需训练的植物个体分割方法，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Conclusion: 该方法在动态空对空环境中显著提升了无人机感知的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Result: GA-DMS在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据优化和模型改进，显著提升了CLIP在人物表征学习中的效果。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's

Motivation: 构建大规模PET成像基础模型面临标记数据有限和计算资源不足的挑战。

Result: 仅用500样本即可生成高质量投影数据，性能媲美大数据集训练的模型，适用于多种任务且内存使用低于24GB。

Conclusion: ALL-PET在低资源条件下高效解决了PET成像的多样化任务需求。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Result: ANN在噪声环境下表现优于PH方法，可能因其能从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验。

Conclusion: ANN为噪声环境下的拓扑估计提供了有潜力的替代方案。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

Result: 用户研究表明，OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知。

Conclusion: OSIM为3D重建和生成模型的标准化评估提供了新工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

*Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种以数据集为驱动的视角，重新审视视频理解模型的架构演变，强调数据集的结构性压力如何引导模型设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集对模型架构演变的指导作用。本文旨在填补这一空白，展示数据集如何通过运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次组合和多模态丰富性等特性为模型提供归纳偏置。

Method: 通过重新解读视频理解领域的里程碑模型（如双流网络、3D CNN、序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型），分析它们如何响应数据集驱动的压力。

Result: 论文提供了一个统一的框架，将数据集、归纳偏置和架构结合起来，为模型设计提供实用指导，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Conclusion: 本文不仅是对视频理解领域的全面回顾，还为推动通用视频理解的发展提供了规范性路线图。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过多尺度标注数据集验证了细胞与组织交互对病理图像分析的重要性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型难以模拟病理学家在不同放大倍数下的行为，缺乏多尺度标注数据集阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 挑战赛提供了来自6个器官的673对多尺度标注数据，参与者开发了结合细胞与组织关系的模型。

Result: 最佳模型在测试集上F1分数比基线模型提高了7.99，证明了多尺度语义的重要性。

Conclusion: 多尺度语义的引入显著提升了细胞检测性能，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

TL;DR: RT-DETR++改进RT-DETR模型的编码器，通过AU/AD机制和CSP-PAC技术提升小目标和密集目标检测性能，同时保持实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化和遮挡等挑战，需要改进现有方法。

Method: 引入通道门控注意力上/下采样机制（AU/AD）和并行空洞卷积的CSP-PAC技术，优化特征融合。

Result: 模型在小目标和密集目标检测上表现优异，且保持实时性，计算复杂度未增加。

Conclusion: RT-DETR++为实时检测系统的特征编码设计提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

### [34] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架，用于减少知识冗余和噪声，提升KB-VQA的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在知识检索中引入冗余和噪声，影响回答准确性。

Method: 通过低噪声查询检索知识，利用大模型提取关键信息，并选择性整合知识。

Result: 实验表明框架优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效减少冗余，提升知识利用效率。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [35] [CWSSNet: Hyperspectral Image Classification Enhanced by Wavelet Domain Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09163)
*Yulin Tong,Fengzong Zhang,Haiqin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积的分类框架CWSSNet，用于高光谱图像的地物分类，在小样本训练条件下表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像因波段多、维度高和光谱混合特性导致特征冗余，传统方法分类性能受限。

Method: 利用ZY1F卫星高光谱数据，结合多尺度卷积注意力模块和多波段小波域分解卷积操作。

Result: 在多个指标（mIoU、mAcc、mF1）上表现优异，对水体、植被和裸地分类效果最佳。

Conclusion: CWSSNet在小样本条件下分类效果接近最优，训练时间增加有限，具有可靠性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Result: 基准测试结果显示当前AI检测方法在真实条件下存在局限性，人类少样本学习能力在检测AI生成图像方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 论文强调了借鉴人类适应性开发更鲁棒检测算法的重要性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级自适应的Dark-ISP插件，用于低光环境下的RAW图像处理，提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光环境下目标检测因图像质量下降而困难，现有方法存在信息损失或框架复杂的问题。

Method: 将传统ISP流程分解为可微分的线性与非线性子模块，结合任务驱动损失优化，并引入自增强机制。

Result: 在三个RAW数据集上优于现有RGB和RAW检测方法，参数少且性能优越。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP通过自适应ISP流程优化，显著提升了低光环境下的目标检测效果。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Workshop on Visual Quality Assessment. The challenge aims to evaluate and
enhance the ability of state-of-the-art LMMs to perform open-ended and detailed
reasoning about visual quality differences across multiple images. To this end,
the competition introduces a novel benchmark comprising thousands of

emerging capabilities of instruction-tuned LMMs on quality assessment. This
challenge marks a significant step toward open-domain visual quality reasoning
and comparison and serves as a catalyst for future research on interpretable
and human-aligned quality evaluation systems.

TL;DR: MGTraj是一种多粒度目标引导的人类轨迹预测模型，通过递归细化网络和速度预测辅助任务，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标引导方法在粗粒度和细粒度之间缺乏中间粒度，限制了预测性能的提升。

Method: MGTraj采用递归编码和Transformer网络，从粗到细逐步细化轨迹预测，并整合多粒度特征。

Result: 在EHT/UCY和Stanford Drone Dataset上，MGTraj优于基线方法并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 多粒度建模和递归细化策略有效提升了目标引导轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

TL;DR: Medverse是一个通用的3D医学影像ICL模型，通过多任务训练和创新的学习框架，实现了高保真预测和全局解剖理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像ICL模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和区域的统一模型。

Method: Medverse采用渐进式自回归ICL框架和块状交叉注意力模块，支持多尺度解剖感知和高效计算。

Result: 在未见过的数据集上，Medverse显著优于现有ICL基线，确立了新的ICL范式。

Conclusion: Medverse为医学影像ICL提供了统一且高效的解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt是一种稳健的架构，可提高诊断准确性并减轻病理学家的工作负担。

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Method: 构建MMOral数据集和MMOral-Bench评估套件，提出OralGPT模型进行监督微调。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o准确率仅41.45%，OralGPT单次微调提升24.73%。

Conclusion: MMOral和OralGPT为智能牙科奠定了基础，推动牙科领域多模态AI系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中存在时间顺序建模不足和长距离依赖问题，导致信息丢失和时间理解退化。

Method: 结合时间戳注入机制（TIM）和语义引导的时间感知相似性采样（TASS），构建连续时间参考系统，并通过两阶段算法优化视频采样。

Result: 在长时间视频基准测试中，7B和72B模型均取得显著提升，7B模型甚至在某些任务上超越72B模型。

Conclusion: DATE方法有效提升了多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的时间感知和事件定位能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有高效分割模型多为静态设计，难以平衡性能与资源效率，限制了临床应用的适应性。

Method: PSP-Seg从冗余模型出发，结合块级剪枝和功能解耦损失逐步剪枝冗余模块。

Result: PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上性能与nnU-Net相当，但GPU内存减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是一种成本效益高且性能优异的解决方案，适合大规模临床应用。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部工具或单一推理策略，难以验证中间步骤，限制了图表理解的准确性和灵活性。

Method: 采用CaT方法，将图表信息转换为可验证的符号格式，并结合视觉可编程性，动态选择代码或视觉推理路径。

Conclusion: VLMs不仅能学习推理，还能动态选择最佳推理路径，为复杂任务提供更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的U-net架构，通过引入模态无关的输入通道和处理新模态的能力，提升了脑MRI多模态分割的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型在处理新模态时效果不佳，无法有效利用不同组合的模态信息。

Method: 在U-net中集成模态无关的输入通道，并通过图像增强生成人工MRI模态进行训练。

Result: 在包含多种病理和模态的8个MRI数据库上验证了模型的有效性，能够处理训练中未见过的模态。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留处理已知模态能力的同时，显著提升了处理新模态的分割效果。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一种新颖的对象中心学习框架，用于在SAR图像中分离目标表示与背景杂波，无需掩码标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）会干扰目标特征提取，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征。

Method: SlotSAR结合了SARATR-X的高层语义特征和小波散射网络的低层散射特征，通过多级槽注意力模块增强表示区分性。

Result: 实验表明，SlotSAR在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能，保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征集成和槽注意力，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波的分离问题。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在材料表征图像理解方面的能力尚未充分探索，MatCha旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MatCha包含21个任务，覆盖材料研究的四个关键阶段，评估MLLMs与人类专家的性能差距。

Result: MLLMs在需要高级专业知识和复杂视觉感知的任务中表现不佳，现有提示方法难以改善。

Conclusion: MatCha揭示了MLLMs在材料表征场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Motivation: 现有异构协作感知方法需要联合训练或预存模型，不适用于实际场景。

Method: 提出PHCP框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，动态对齐特征。

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上表现优异，接近SOTA方法，仅需少量无标记数据。

Conclusion: PHCP为异构协作感知提供了一种无需联合训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 预训练数据的领域相关性对少样本SSA性能至关重要，领域相关的小数据集可以优于大规模但不匹配的数据集。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Motivation: 当前ONSD测量方法存在操作不一致、主观性强和阈值变异性等问题，限制了其可靠性，需要非侵入性替代方案。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 眼底超声视频处理阶段进行解剖分割、关键帧识别和ONSD测量；2) 结合ONSD指标和临床特征预测ICP分级。

Result: 验证准确率为0.845±0.071，独立测试准确率为0.786，显著优于传统阈值方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少操作变异性并整合多源信息，为临床ICP评估提供了可靠的非侵入性方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者管理。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IC制造中缺陷多样且细粒度，传统方法依赖外部正常集，但IC图像布局多变且对齐困难，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合正常特征，通过一致性损失关联正常区域，解码器重建正常内容，利用重建残差分割缺陷。

Result: 在三个IC工艺阶段的数据集上表现优于现有方法，对产品变异性具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部正常支持，能有效分割IC缺陷，适用于多样化的IC制造场景。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: DRiFt通过特征解耦和对齐显著提升模型泛化能力，为临床提供更安全可靠的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Conclusion: FS-Diff通过语义引导和清晰度感知机制，显著提升了图像融合和超分辨率的效果，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入，限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过扩散过程和分层贝叶斯建模，将融合问题转化为最大似然估计问题，并结合EM算法优化。

Result: 在哈佛数据集上测试，FlexiD-Fuse在多种模态输入下表现最佳，且扩展实验验证了其普适性。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse在医学图像融合任务中表现出色，适用于多种模态和场景。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SSA地区高质量标注数据稀缺问题，支持临床决策。

Method: 采用3D Attention UNet架构，结合残差块和迁移学习，基于BraTS 2021数据集预训练。

Result: 在BraTS-Africa数据集上，Dice分数分别为ET 0.76、NETC 0.80、SNFH 0.85。

Conclusion: 模型具有通用性和实用性，有助于缩小全球健康AI的差距。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Result: 研究表明，现代生成模型产生的合成图像已难以与真实图像区分，新数据集和平台能有效提升检测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度伪造检测提供了动态更新的基准，有助于应对不断演变的虚假信息威胁。

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Result: 该方法减少了脚部滑动和抖动，提高了平衡性，同时保持了运动的准确性。

Conclusion: 利用动量约束可以有效解决局部与全局运动的耦合问题，提升运动生成的质量。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了高块级准确率（如96.34%），并生成了一致的区域级对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在现实漫画应用中具有潜力，能够有效处理无标注的线稿图像。

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，而现有传感器无3D超声方法未能充分结合局部和全局特征。

Method: DualTrack采用局部编码器（密集时空卷积）和全局编码器（图像主干与时序注意力层），通过轻量融合模块结合特征估计轨迹。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，DualTrack实现了低于5毫米的平均重建误差，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦局部和全局特征提取，为3D超声重建提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments

Result: 实验证明DL模型存在基于种族和性别的捷径学习与偏见，影响AD分类的公平性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更公平的脑MRI诊断工具奠定了基础，并提供了开源代码。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间取得了最佳平衡，为实际遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架，通过多模态指令理解和真实感肖像生成，解决了现有方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将指令条件视为低级别跟踪，缺乏对指令传达的交流目的的建模，导致叙事连贯性和角色表现力受限。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成蓝图视频；第二阶段通过并行生成子片段，结合全局到局部框架保留细节。

Result: Kling-Avatar能够生成1080p、48 fps的生动流畅长视频，在唇同步、情感表达、指令可控性等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟形象合成设立了新基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限的情况下实现了生物学合理的图像生成，结合了机制先验和生成空间-时间预测。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Result: 评估了多种先进MLLMs，提供了关于模型在拒绝错误答案方面的表现的有价值发现。

Conclusion: HumbleBench为安全关键场景提供了更真实的MLLM可靠性评估，填补了现有评估的空白。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: 提出UAE框架，通过Auto-Encoder视角统一理解（I2T）与生成（T2I）过程，利用强化学习优化双向信息流，提升多模态学习效果。


<details>

Motivation: 探索多模态学习中理解与生成的协同作用，通过统一训练目标增强双向信息流。

Method: 提出UAE框架，分三阶段强化学习：冷启动、生成促进理解、理解优化生成。

Result: 编码器生成更丰富描述，解码器理解能力提升，重建效果显著。

Conclusion: UAE框架在多模态学习中实现理解与生成的协同优化，效果显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAE或扩散模型方法无法充分建模人体运动的几何特性，NRMF旨在通过几何约束和动态建模解决这一问题。

Method: NRMF在关节旋转、角速度和角加速度的乘积空间中构建NDFs，并提出自适应步长混合算法和几何积分器。

Result: 在AMASS数据集上训练后，NRMF在去噪、运动插值和部分2D/3D观测拟合等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何建模和动态约束显著提升了3D人体运动的生成和恢复效果。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

TL;DR: 扩散模型的最优去噪器仅能复现训练集图像，而深度扩散模型的行为与之不同。本文证明深度扩散模型的局部性源于图像数据集的统计特性，而非卷积神经网络的归纳偏置。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验，证明最优参数线性去噪器与深度神经去噪器具有相似的局部性，并分析像素相关性对局部性的影响。

Result: 局部性源于自然图像数据集的像素相关性，而非卷积网络的归纳偏置。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，设计了一个更匹配深度扩散模型预测分数的解析去噪器。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

Result: 在仿真和实际机器人（NAO机器人）实验中验证了方法的有效性，任务重叠率显著降低（最高减少52%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在通信受限、环境复杂的情况下，能够高效协调多智能体系统，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

<details>

Motivation: 航空航天和机器人领域对轻量化高强复合材料的需求日益增长，但传统制造方法难以实现复杂3D结构且存在连接弱点。

Method: 采用3DFiT技术，通过连续单丝纤维精确排列，制造FCC晶格结构的无人机框架，避免了传统组装中的弱点。

Result: 无人机框架重量仅260克，比商用DJI F450轻10%，比金属和热塑性材料强度高4-8倍，飞行时间延长3分钟。

Conclusion: 3DFiT技术为轻量化无人机框架提供了一种可扩展且高效的制造方法，展示了单丝晶格桁架结构的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流场的运动规划方法KoopMotion，利用Koopman算子理论生成收敛到目标轨迹的平滑运动场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子理论在建模动态系统时虽有效，但无法保证收敛到目标轨迹或指定终点，这在从演示中学习（LfD）时是必需的。

Method: KoopMotion将运动流场表示为动态系统，通过Koopman算子参数化来模仿目标轨迹，并利用流场的发散特性实现收敛和跟踪。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上验证了有效性，并在真实机器人（小型自主水面车辆）上进行了实验。

Conclusion: KoopMotion在时空样本效率上表现优异，仅需3%的LASA数据即可生成密集运动计划，且在时空动态建模指标上显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Conclusion: 欠驱动变形机制在高效、适应性强的加载应用中具有潜力，其建模和优化框架可推广至更广泛的机械手设计。

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了双足机器人在户外环境中的运动稳定性和感知能力。

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field

reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: VLA-Adapter显著降低了VLA模型的部署门槛，仅需8小时在消费级GPU上训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Motivation: 连续机器人在受限和非结构化环境中表现出色，但长期使用会导致机械疲劳和材料退化，影响性能和安全性。目前疲劳估计研究不足，限制了长期操作。

Method: 采用混合铰链-梁结构（TwistBeam和BendBeam）解耦扭转和弯曲，被动限位器约束运动并检测极限扭矩，实时疲劳估计方法通过电机扭矩估算刚度。

Result: 实验表明，该设计比传统设计减少约49%的疲劳积累，被动限位器和电机侧传感能准确估计结构疲劳和损伤。

Conclusion: 该架构有效提升了连续机器人的长期操作安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

Abstract: Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and
reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have
driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying
hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

Result: 在传感器高度变化和反向导航等任务中表现优于图像相对方法，并能泛化到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制提供了一种更灵活、泛化能力更强的视觉导航解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人多模仿外观和关节运动，但忽视了生物体的全身膨胀-收缩运动对生命感感知的影响。

Method: 开发了MOFU机器人，采用Jitterbug结构和双轮驱动机制，通过在线视频调查评估其运动效果。

Result: 膨胀-收缩运动显著增强了生命感感知，但双机器人未显著提升效果；结合运动时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 体积变化运动是机器人设计中增强生命感感知的重要元素。

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

Result: 该方法保留了演示意图，支持机器人特定策略，提高了噪声鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示数据。

Conclusion: Dexplore为将不完美演示转化为有效训练信号提供了原则性桥梁，支持灵巧操作任务。

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: SimpleVLA-RL减少了对大规模数据的依赖，提升了泛化能力，并在实际任务中超越SFT。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Result: 讨论了委员会机器多样性崩溃的存在。

Conclusion: 该框架为不确定性估计和分解提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能，适用于多种量子学习任务和非线性量子性质预测。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

Result: 算法在对抗性环境下收敛速度与非对抗情况相近，且信息论下界证明其性能最优。

Conclusion: 填补了鲁棒强化学习中异步Q学习的空白，提供了首个有限时间鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

TL;DR: FoundationalECGNet是一种用于自动ECG分类的基础框架，结合多种技术提升性能，在多数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，现有ECG分析方法受噪声、类别不平衡和数据异质性限制，需更准确的诊断系统。

Method: 模型整合双阶段小波去噪、CBAM、GAT和TST，捕捉多通道ECG信号的时空依赖性，先区分正常与异常，再细分异常类型。

Result: 模型在正常与异常分类中F1-score达99%，多类疾病检测表现优异，并提供风险等级评估。

Conclusion: FoundationalECGNet是一种可扩展、可解释且通用的ECG分析解决方案，有望提升诊断精度和患者预后。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

TL;DR: 该论文通过将LRP类归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，分析了其数值特性，并推导了归因值的分布上界和分量界，最终得出控制归因收敛的乘法常数。


<details>

Motivation: 研究LRP类归因方法的数值特性，揭示其与梯度矩阵的关联，并分析归因值的分布和收敛行为。

Method: 将LRP类方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，类比雅可比矩阵乘法，推导归因值的上界和分量界。

Result: 发现LRP-beta的乘法常数与权重范数无关，区别于梯度方法和LRP-epsilon。

Conclusion: 研究结果为多数据增强和Smoothgrad类方法提供了理论支持，揭示了LRP-beta的独特性质。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

TL;DR: 通过碳感知客户端选择和训练调度，减少联邦学习中的碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器学习训练产生高碳排放，联邦学习通过分布式计算利用区域和时间碳强度差异，探索减少排放的方法。

Method: 提出碳感知调度策略，利用空闲时间延迟训练至低碳时段，并整合公平碳分配和全局微调阶段。

Result: 在真实碳强度数据上，调度器优于非空闲感知基线，在严格碳约束下表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 碳感知调度能有效平衡碳排放和模型性能，尤其在低碳预算下表现优异。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Motivation: 旋涂聚合物薄膜的机械性能优化是一个多目标问题，需要兼顾硬度与弹性。

Method: 使用PyePAL算法（基于高斯过程模型）优化设计变量（转速、稀释度、聚合物混合物），并结合UMAP可视化和模糊语言摘要提高可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能高效找到优化的聚合物设计，并通过可视化与语言解释辅助专家分析。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了性能，还通过解释性工具增强了结果的可理解性。

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Motivation: Transformer虽然能模拟MPC算法，但其二次时间复杂度限制了可扩展性，因此需要一种高效的注意力机制。

Method: 引入近似最近邻注意力（ANNA），证明其能保持标准注意力的表达能力，并解决Match2和$k$-hop等任务。

Result: ANNA-transformers能模拟MPC算法，解决关键推理任务，且能模拟低秩Transformer。

Conclusion: ANNA提供了一种统一的方法来推理高效注意力近似，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的表格数据常包含异构上下文，单一全局分布无法捕捉这些细微差异，导致异常检测性能下降。

Result: 在多个表格基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 上下文在准确区分异常和正常实例中至关重要，该方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Result: 在2天预报范围内，RMSE比最佳AI天气模型低10%，显著优于单个专家模型和简单平均方法。

Conclusion: MoWE方法是一种计算高效且可扩展的策略，能够充分利用现有高质量预测模型，推动数据驱动天气预报的进步。

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Method: 采用PRISMA框架对100多篇文献进行范围综述，评估ML在保护任务中的性能，并提出标准化建议。

Result: ML模型在模拟数据上表现良好，但在实际场景中验证不足，研究缺乏标准化和可比性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注真实数据验证、标准化报告和先进ML架构，以推动ML在动态电力系统中的实际应用。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架在特征子集推理上的高计算成本和单标量解释的表达能力限制问题。

Method: 采用RKHS中的正交功能分解，通过递归核中心化程序计算功能组件，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了0.6到9.7倍的加速，中位数约为3.0倍，同时保持高保真度（R²在0.81到0.999之间）。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过功能视角补充标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断工具如“组件手术”，在实验范围内量化特定交互的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Result: 在Rashomon比例大的场景下，AUROC提升0.20+，并在实际应用中验证了稳健性和实用性。

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble通过多样化模型选择显著提升泛化能力，适用于真实世界的复杂问题。

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Result: 实验证明Sensitivity-LoRA在多种任务和基准测试中表现出高效、稳定和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA解决了LoRA的局限性，为资源受限环境下的LLM微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，因果输入提高了预测精度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架可推广至高维动态领域，为因果预测建模提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以处理高频率或不规则时间间隔的复杂动态系统，且连续时间强化学习（CTRL）在多智能体领域应用受限。

Method: 使用PINNs近似HJB方程的值函数，引入VGI模块迭代优化值梯度，提升梯度保真度和策略学习效果。

Result: 在连续时间多智能体基准测试（如MPE和MuJoCo）中表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CT-MARL框架有效解决了多智能体连续时间强化学习的挑战，并展示了良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Conclusion: ISP可采用该方法自动化对等伙伴选择，优化互联网生态。

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

*Maria Risques,Kratika Bhagtani,Amit Kumar Singh Yadav,Edward J. Delp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HISPASpoof是首个针对西班牙语合成语音检测和溯源的大规模数据集，填补了西班牙语在语音取证领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 西班牙语在全球有超过6亿使用者，但在合成语音检测方面缺乏代表性数据集。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含六种口音的真实语音和六种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音，并评估五种检测方法。

Result: 在西班牙语上，基于英语训练的检测器表现不佳，而基于HISPASpoof训练的检测器显著提升性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为西班牙语语音取证提供了重要基准，推动了可靠和包容的语音取证研究。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过自适应令牌合并减少预训练视觉Transformer的计算和传输资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模Transformer模型在语义通信系统中表现强大，但其高计算需求限制了在资源受限的6G网络中的实际部署。

Method: 将每层合并比例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用高斯过程贝叶斯优化构建帕累托前沿，实现动态适应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少浮点运算，同时保持准确性，适应不同信噪比条件。

Conclusion: 为未来边缘智能系统中部署基于Transformer的语义通信提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

for short-term trend prediction with Quantum Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (QA3C), a quantum-enhanced variant of the classical A3C. Trained

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO是一种序列级强化学习方法，通过长度公平的剪裁优化LLM的响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在剪裁时存在长度不公平问题，FSPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FSPO在重要性采样权重空间中引入高斯驱动的剪裁策略，通过KL校正和√L缩放实现长度公平。

Result: FSPO在多个数据集上表现优于基线，训练更稳定。

Conclusion: FSPO通过长度公平剪裁有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估指标导致模糊预测被奖励，而忽略罕见高影响事件，需改进。

Method: 采用双解码器架构，结合背景/极端分解、物理过采样和任务特定损失函数。

Result: DART在极端对流检测中表现优异（CSI=0.273），并验证了'IVT悖论'。

Conclusion: DART为极端天气预测提供了可信的AI解决方案，并易于集成到现有工作流。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

Result: 在基准环境中验证了IP3O优于现有安全强化学习算法的性能，并提供了理论最优性误差界。

Conclusion: IP3O有效解决了约束强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，具有理论和实证优势。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in

growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，需要一种能够处理不同规模和结构的归纳策略方法。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，通过神经消息传递将状态转换为二分图并映射到潜在状态，结合监督和强化学习训练策略。

Result: Vejde策略在未见过的测试实例上表现良好，得分接近针对特定实例训练的MLP代理。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效生成归纳策略，适用于复杂结构决策问题，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

Motivation: 避免未训练的ERS对学生学习造成负面影响，同时提升模拟器的预测准确性。

Method: 提出LDSim方法，从LLM中蒸馏领域知识和推理能力，优化预测性能。

Result: 在模拟任务和知识追踪任务上均取得优异表现。

Conclusion: LDSim在性能和效率之间取得了平衡，为教育推荐系统提供了有效支持。

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转机械设备的智能故障诊断通常需要大量标记数据，但实际工业应用中数据获取困难且成本高，且不同设备需单独训练模型。

Method: 结合时频域编码器和元学习模型，通过随机增强生成状态表示，利用少量标记数据进行微调和对比学习优化。

Result: 在轴承故障数据集和转子测试台数据上，仅需1%标记数据即可达到99%的诊断准确率，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架高效且泛化能力强，适用于多种机械设备的故障诊断。

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和Deep Search三个任务上，EMPG显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EMPG通过调整学习信号，有效提升了LLM在长时任务中的性能。

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）依赖局部成对消息传递，难以捕捉复杂的高阶子图模式，且现有方法局限于图级任务，灵活性不足。

Method: MoSE框架通过匿名游走提取信息子图，并基于结构语义动态路由到专家模型，以捕捉多样子图模式。

Result: MoSE在Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman测试中表现更强，实验显示其优于基线模型并提供可解释性。

Conclusion: MoSE不仅提升了性能，还通过可视化学习到的子图模式提供了结构洞察。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Conclusion: 新方法在鲁棒性和确定性上优于现有方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of
best-performing baselines.

TL;DR: 研究探讨语言模型生成的反事实解释（SCEs）的有效性和最小性，发现其有效性高但最小性不足，可能误导决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型需解释决策以与人类协作，反事实解释是一种自解释方式。

Method: 评估LLMs生成的反事实解释是否有效（改变预测）和最小（最少修改输入）。

Result: LLMs生成的反事实解释通常有效但不最小，最小修改时又常无效。

Conclusion: SCEs作为解释工具效果有限，可能误导，需谨慎用于高风险场景。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合机器学习和地统计学的混合框架KpR，通过空间滞后特征提升预测性能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合机器学习和地统计学的优势，解决土壤属性预测中空间信息利用不足的问题。

Method: 使用KpR框架，通过普通克里金生成空间滞后特征，结合TabPFN模型进行预测。

Result: KpR显著提升了预测精度（R2提高约30%），并提供了可靠的预测不确定性估计。

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN结合是一种鲁棒且多功能的数字土壤制图框架，适用于精准农业。

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为fuser的新算法，用于微生物组共现网络推断，通过考虑不同环境下的时空动态性，显著提高了跨环境预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微生物组共现网络推断算法通常仅分析单一环境下的静态数据，忽略了微生物群落在不同生态条件下的动态适应性。

Method: 研究使用Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)框架评估算法性能，并提出fuser算法，该算法在训练时保留子样本特异性信号并跨环境共享信息。

Result: fuser在单一环境（Same）下与现有算法（如glmnet）性能相当，在跨环境（All）场景下显著降低了测试误差。

Conclusion: fuser算法通过考虑环境特异性，为微生物组网络推断提供了更动态和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于分数的建模在离散图生成中具有实际优势，能够实现灵活的多属性分子设计。

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上均表现优异，外源变量提升预测性能。

Conclusion: AquaCast模型具有鲁棒性和可扩展性，适用于复杂水动态预测。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Result: 在不同目标函数下实现次线性收敛，实验显示显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD在隐私和性能间取得更好平衡，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Conclusion: 小样本学习在医疗诊断中可行，尤其是在缺乏大型标记数据集时。

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,

Conclusion: 双重评分方法能有效检测攻击并保持诚实客户端的自然相似性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅在图领域有效，还能泛化至视觉-语言表示的无监督对齐。

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Conclusion: 该模拟器显著提升计算效率，支持参数空间探索和罕见事件统计研究。

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在保护子群中减少伤害并实现公平目标（如覆盖率或伤害）的问题。

Method: 使用Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (FG-FARL)，与行为克隆(BC)和HACO进行比较。

Result: FG-FARL在保持性能的同时提高了公平性指标。

Conclusion: FG-FARL为更安全和公平的决策支持提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant提出了一种基于可学习蝴蝶变换的量化方法，通过自适应旋转消除异常值，显著提升了2位量化的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的内存需求限制了其在消费级硬件上的部署，而极端2位量化因激活中的异常值导致性能下降。现有旋转方法使用固定变换，无法适应不同层的异常值模式。

Method: ButterflyQuant用可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard旋转，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化，支持梯度优化并保证正交性。还引入均匀性正则化以平滑激活分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，2位量化的ButterflyQuant困惑度为15.4，优于QuaRot的22.1。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过自适应旋转和轻量级学习，显著提升了极端量化的性能，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.
