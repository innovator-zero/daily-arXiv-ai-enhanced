This thesis presents a\nreal-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in\nshared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset\nuser to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,\nensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.\nRemoval is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,\nfollowed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,\nimplemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be\nportable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D\nscanning of the environment.

In our\nexperiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South\nAustralia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data.

In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and\nlocal model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL\nsuffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for\ngathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive\nmechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing\nthe utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is\ntheoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader\nand the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived\nto maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is\nformulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal\nstrategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an\nAdaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to\nstabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.\nExtensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the\nproposed method."}

In this\npaper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise\nprediction of glioma progression.

Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis\nmodule to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton\nsnippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training\nsamples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results\nagainst skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,\nUBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes."}

This forces learning algorithms to\nrediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,\nartificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced\nmultibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a\nData-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form\nNewton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for\ntensor-based control design.

This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance.

Our method estimates\nuncertainties in semantic predictions using Evidential Deep Learning and\nincorporates them into BKI for robust semantic inference. It further aggregates\nnoisy observations into coherent Gaussian representations to mitigate the\nimpact of unreliable points, while employing geometry-aligned kernels that\nadapt to complex scene structures. These Gaussian primitives effectively fuse\nlocal geometric and semantic information, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware\nmapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse\noff-road and urban outdoor environments demonstrates consistent improvements in\nmapping quality, uncertainty calibration, representational flexibility, and\nrobustness, while maintaining real-time efficiency."}

However, they often produce inaccurate or\nunreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly\nlimits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing\nneed for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for\nhallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and\nthermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response\nto a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood\ntoken paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By\nanalyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under\nchanges in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic\nstability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying\nunstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is\ncomputationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the\nmodel's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural\nnetworks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical\ninterpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.\nRemarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField\nachieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and\ndatasets."}

Following normalization, a Generalized\nCross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain\ntransferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the\nsimulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and\nreal-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing\nthe diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world\nscenarios.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies.

Effective analysis demands models\nthat capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual\ncharacteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency\nmodeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by\nintrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to\nthe high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot\nprocess high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before\ndownsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling\nfine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,\nMulti-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as\ncomputation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual\ndependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community.

RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as\nunbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak\ngeneralization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive\nSemantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level\nmasks to semantically rich and textured regions.

However, it remains a\nprevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and\nenvironmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of\naccommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and\ncomplex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency\nmatrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)\nvalues to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability.

This\ncompromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,\nsuppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,\nwe introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for\nMulti-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on\nimplicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit\ncorrespondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the\nattention control.

Evaluations on a wheeled mobile robot show\nthat the proposed policy, when trained in simulation, outperforms its\nreal-world-trained version by 31% and the prior state-of-the-art methods by 50%\nin navigation success rate. Policy generalization is verified by deploying the\nsame model onboard a drone.\n  Our results highlight the importance of diverse image encoder pretraining for\nsim-to-real generalization, and identify on-policy learning as a key advantage\nof simulated training over training with real data."}

Recent vision language models (VLMs)\nachieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak\ntemporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs\n(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured\nobject-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We\nintroduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene\ngraph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks\n(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM\nimproves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though\ngains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise\nand current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future\nhybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding."}

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.
