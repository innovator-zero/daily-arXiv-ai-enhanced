### [1] [A Real-Time Diminished Reality Approach to Privacy in MR Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10466)
*Christian Fane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于实时修复的减实系统，用于混合现实会议中的隐私控制，通过语义分割和对象选择实现实时去除敏感物品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在共享空间的混合现实会议中，隐私控制是一个重要问题。该系统旨在通过实时去除敏感物品来保护用户隐私。

Method: 系统使用YOLOv11进行对象检测，并采用改进的解耦时空变换器（DSTT）模型进行高质量视频修复，结合ZED 2i深度摄像头实现实时处理。

Result: 在720p分辨率下，系统帧率超过20 fps，验证了实时减实技术的可行性。

Conclusion: 该系统为混合现实中的隐私保护提供了一种便携且高效的解决方案，无需固定视角或预先3D扫描环境。

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

### [2] [SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555)
*Alejandra Perez,Chinedu Nwoye,Ramtin Raji Kermani,Omid Mohareri,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgLaVi是目前最大、最多样化的手术视觉语言数据集，包含24万视频片段-文本对，支持手术工作流理解，并通过SurgCLIP模型在多项任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术视觉语言预训练数据集规模小、多样性不足、语义质量低且缺乏层次结构，限制了手术VLP的发展。

Method: 提出SurgLaVi数据集，采用自动化流程生成细粒度视频转录和分割，并通过双模态过滤确保高质量标注。基于此开发SurgCLIP双编码器对比学习模型。

Result: SurgCLIP在阶段、步骤、动作和工具识别任务中显著超越现有方法，验证了大尺度、语义丰富数据集的价值。

Conclusion: SurgLaVi为手术基础模型开发提供了关键资源，其层次化结构和丰富语义直接提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

### [3] [Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620)
*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SimCLR的自监督学习基础模型，用于3D脑MRI分析，在多个任务中表现优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D脑MRI模型通用性差、分辨率低和可访问性不足的问题。

Method: 使用SimCLR自监督学习方法，预训练于11个公开数据集（18,759名患者，44,958次扫描）。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现最佳，即使仅用20%标记数据也能在阿尔茨海默病预测中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型通用性强、可访问性高，为临床脑MRI分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

### [4] [USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10651)
*Xiaoyang Ma,Yiyang Chai,Xinran Qu,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理约束的RGB到HSI重建方法，通过估计相机光谱敏感性和光照，结合低秩子空间SVT算子，开发了USCTNet网络，显著提升了重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB到HSI重建中因相机光谱敏感性和光照参数不准确导致的物理不一致性问题。

Method: 将RGB-to-HSI重建建模为物理约束的逆问题，引入低秩子空间SVT算子避免完整SVD计算，开发USCTNet网络结合参数估计模块和近端更新。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，重建精度显著优于现有RGB-based方法。

Conclusion: USCTNet通过物理约束和低秩子空间优化，实现了更精确且稳定的RGB-to-HSI重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

### [5] [A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors on MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10683)
*Felicia Liu,Jay J. Yoo,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs在医学影像任务（如胶质瘤分类和分割）中表现不佳，CNN优于LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在医学影像任务中的有效性，填补其在图像应用中的空白。

Method: 使用BraTS 2020数据集，评估LLM（LLaMA 3.2 Instruct）在微调前后的性能，并与3D CNN对比。

Result: CNN分类准确率80%，LLM仅76%，且特异性低；分割任务中LLM空间理解有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs不适合医学影像任务，需更严格的微调或训练策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

### [6] [Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687)
*Hao Zhang,Chun-Han Yao,Simon Donné,Narendra Ahuja,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP4D是一个框架，用于从单目输入生成配对的RGB和运动学部件视频，通过双分支扩散模型实现RGB帧和部件分割图的联合合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统部件分割方法依赖基于外观的语义线索，而SP4D旨在学习与物体关节对齐且跨视图和时间一致的部件。

Method: 采用双分支扩散模型，引入空间颜色编码方案和双向扩散融合模块，结合对比部件一致性损失。

Result: 生成的2D部件图可提升至3D，适用于动画和运动相关任务，实验表明SP4D在多样化场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SP4D通过学习运动学部件，提供了一种适用于下游任务的通用解决方案。

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

### [7] [SegSLR: Promptable Video Segmentation for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10710)
*Sven Schreiber,Noha Sarhan,Simone Frintrop,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegSLR结合RGB和姿态信息，通过零样本视频分割提升孤立手语识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法结合RGB和姿态信息时，常因不精确表示（如边界框）丢失关键细节（如手形和方向）。

Method: 利用姿态信息粗略定位手和身体，通过视频分割保留形状信息，并聚焦RGB数据处理于关键部位。

Result: 在ChaLearn249 IsoGD数据集上，SegSLR优于现有方法，且聚焦手和身体的设计被证明有效。

Conclusion: SegSLR通过结合RGB和姿态信息，有效提升孤立手语识别性能，设计选择合理。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

*Jecia Z. Y. Mao,Francis X Creighton,Russell H Taylor,Manish Sahu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语音引导的协作感知框架（SCOPE），结合大型语言模型和视觉基础模型，实现手术场景的实时分割和跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标记数据和领域特定模型，难以适应新手术场景和类别。

Method: 整合LLM和VFM，通过语音反馈引导分割和标记手术器械和解剖结构。

Result: 在公开和内部数据集上验证了实时分割和跟踪能力，并通过实验展示了动态协作潜力。

Conclusion: 展示了开发适应性强、免提、以外科医生为中心的手术室工具的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

### [9] [Every Camera Effect, Every Time, All at Once: 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing for Physics-based Camera Effect Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10759)
*Yi-Ruei Liu,You-Zhe Xie,Yu-Hsiang Hsu,I-Sheng Fang,Yu-Lun Liu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-GRT是一种结合4D高斯溅射和基于物理的光线追踪的两阶段方法，用于模拟相机效果，解决了现有数据生成方法的高成本或模拟与真实差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉系统假设理想针孔相机，但面对鱼眼畸变和滚动快门等真实相机效果时表现不佳，主要因缺乏相关训练数据。

Method: 4D-GRT通过多视角视频重建动态场景，再应用光线追踪生成可控且物理准确的相机效果视频。

Result: 4D-GRT在渲染速度上最快，渲染质量优于或与现有基线相当，并构建了八个合成动态场景作为基准。

Conclusion: 4D-GRT有效解决了相机效果模拟的瓶颈，为计算机视觉系统提供了高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

*Marcelo Sandoval-Castaneda,Bryan Russell,Josef Sivic,Gregory Shakhnarovich,Fabian Caba Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体方法，通过Editor和Critic代理自动化视频编辑任务，并引入基于学习的方法促进代理间通信，最终通过用户研究验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑工具主要关注检索或用户界面，而将实际编辑任务留给用户，本文旨在自动化核心编辑任务。

Method: 设计了Editor和Critic两个代理，Editor根据自然语言指令编辑视频，Critic提供反馈或渲染结果，并引入学习方法来优化代理间通信。

Result: 系统在覆盖率、时间约束满足和人类偏好方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法和学习型通信策略能有效自动化视频编辑任务，并通过LLM评估和用户研究验证了其效果。

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

*Sajad Amiri,Shahram Taeb,Sara Gharibi,Setareh Dehghanfard,Somayeh Sadat Mehrnia,Mehrdad Oveisi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu,Arman Rahmim,Mohammad R. Salmanpour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出稳定性感知框架，通过机器学习预测非对比MRI中的胶质瘤对比增强，减少对钆基造影剂的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基造影剂（GBCAs）在胶质瘤成像中虽重要，但存在安全、成本和可及性问题。预测非对比MRI中的对比增强可提供更安全的替代方案。

Method: 分析了1,446例胶质瘤数据，提取108个特征，结合48种降维方法和25种分类器，生成1,200个模型管道，通过旋转验证评估性能。

Result: 交叉验证准确率0.91-0.96，外部测试平均0.93。MI-ETr管道表现最佳，平衡了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 稳定性感知模型选择能可靠预测非对比MRI中的对比增强，减少对GBCAs的依赖，并提高跨中心泛化能力。

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

*Yilun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种检测器无关的后处理框架，通过重叠冗余转化为群体证据，提升无人机图像中小目标的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机图像中因远距离视角、遮挡和杂乱导致的小目标漏检问题。

Method: 采用重叠分块恢复低置信度候选框，通过空间门（DBSCAN）和语义门（ResNet-18嵌入）验证群体证据，并进行置信度重加权和NMS融合。

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上召回率提升0.093，F1分数达0.669，后处理延迟为0.095秒/图像。

Conclusion: 框架无需重新训练，适用于召回敏感的应用，未来将优化语义门成本并引入时序信息。

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

TL;DR: InternScenes是一个大规模、可模拟的室内场景数据集，解决了现有数据集在规模、多样性和布局真实性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在数据规模、多样性和布局真实性上存在局限，影响了Embodied AI的发展。

Method: 通过整合三种场景来源（真实扫描、程序生成和设计师创建），并采用数据处理流程确保可模拟性和交互性。

Result: 数据集包含约40,000个场景、1.96M个3D对象，展示了复杂布局带来的新挑战。

Conclusion: InternScenes为复杂场景的生成和导航任务提供了训练基础，并将开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Conclusion: 选择合适的基函数和多项式阶数可以有效平衡建模精度和计算成本。

Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市场景点云数据中缺乏高质量多视角图像和现有3D分割方法泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 通过多视角、多粒度渲染、掩码级视觉语言特征提取和样本平衡融合，直接从点云生成语义特征。

Result: 在SensatUrban和SUM等基准测试中，OpenUrban3D在分割精度和跨场景泛化能力上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenUrban3D为3D城市场景理解提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光谱成像技术在高压缩比下存在病态重建问题，传统方法和深度学习方法各有局限。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效保持了空间-光谱结构一致性，并在多种重建场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为计算光谱成像提供了可解释的数学基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

Result: 模型在EuroSAT-Landsat数据集上表现优异，即使缺乏显式元数据。

Conclusion: 紧凑且元数据感知的MoE-MAE是未来地球观测基础模型的高效可扩展方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的运动伪影校正方法（ESWGAN-GP），用于HR-pQCT图像，通过模拟运动伪影生成配对数据集，并利用边缘增强和自注意力机制提升校正效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HR-pQCT图像中的运动伪影（如皮质骨条纹和小梁模糊）阻碍了骨微结构的准确评估，目前缺乏标准化的运动伪影校正方法。

Method: 优化传统正弦图方法模拟运动伪影，生成配对数据集；提出ESWGAN-GP模型，结合边缘增强跳跃连接和自注意力机制，使用VGG感知损失重建微结构特征。

Result: 在模拟数据集上，ESWGAN-GP的SNR为26.78，SSIM为0.81，VIF为0.76；在真实数据集上表现更优（SNR=29.31，SSIM=0.87，VIF=0.81）。

Conclusion: 该方法虽未完全解决真实运动伪影的复杂性，但为HR-pQCT中基于深度学习的运动校正迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

Conclusion: 优化眼动校准和信号质量是提升基于凝视的身份验证性能的关键，但需注意滤波的潜在负面影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

Motivation: 肤色识别和生成在模型公平性、医疗和生成AI中很重要，但缺乏全面数据集和鲁棒方法。

Method: 引入TrueSkin数据集，包含6类7299张图像，用于评估和改进现有模型。

Result: 使用TrueSkin训练后，识别准确率提升20%，生成模型肤色保真度显著提高。

Conclusion: TrueSkin是提升肤色任务公平性和准确性的关键资源。

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在识别常见和稀有真菌物种方面表现出强大潜力，符合FungiCLEF 2025的主要目标。

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of
FungiCLEF 2025.

Conclusion: csMIL通过聚类和稀疏化有效提升了多实例学习的鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

Result: 在四个大规模VAD数据集上取得最优性能，覆盖100多个未见过的监控场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需目标域训练数据的情况下，显著提升了零样本视频异常检测的效果。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human
kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic
kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal
microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited
to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable
pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we
developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed
with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract
detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the
cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid
Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of
spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst
formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating
comprehensive reports. By providing an extensible, open-source framework,
Organoid Tracker offers a powerful solution for improving and accelerating
research in kidney development, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery. The
platform is publicly available as open-source software at

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于预测行星探测车的可通行性成本图，结合相机和LiDAR数据，通过自监督训练实现高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行星探测车在复杂地形中的可通行性预测问题，提高探测效率和安全性。

Method: 融合相机和LiDAR数据，采用DINOv3图像编码器和FiLM传感器融合技术，结合Huber和平滑损失优化。

Result: 模型对输入噪声和遮挡表现出高鲁棒性，几何信息主导成本预测，性能差异小。

Conclusion: 贡献包括高保真仿真环境、自监督IMU标签管道和多模态BEV成本图预测模型，未来需改进领域泛化和数据集扩展。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

TL;DR: CAA-Policy是一种端到端模仿学习系统，通过控制辅助注意力机制（CAA）提升感知与控制的协同效果，实现更鲁棒和可泛化的停车策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端学习方法在感知与控制之间缺乏有效协同，导致注意力不稳定，影响策略决策的可靠性。

Method: 提出CAA机制，利用控制信号引导视觉注意力学习，并通过自监督训练和辅助任务（如短时路径预测）增强稳定性。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中，CAA-Policy在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAA-Policy通过控制信号引导注意力学习，显著提升了端到端停车策略的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LoRA的方法，通过微调预训练的视频扩散模型，高效生成高质量360度全景视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全景视频与传统视角视频在投影方式上的根本差异，现有方法通常需要复杂架构或大规模训练，导致效率低下。受LoRA在风格迁移任务中的成功启发，作者将其应用于全景视频生成。

Method: 将全景视频生成视为视角投影的适应问题，通过理论分析证明LoRA可以有效建模投影变换。仅需约1,000个视频微调预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量、左右一致性和运动多样性上优于现有方法，同时保持正确的投影几何。

Conclusion: LoRA方法高效且高质量地解决了全景视频生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种超分辨率引导的多任务学习方法（SMILE），用于提升高光谱解混性能，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱解混性能受限于低空间分辨率，而直接结合超分辨率和解混任务可能面临任务亲和性未验证和解混收敛性无法保证的问题。

Method: 提出SMILE方法，通过理论分析验证多任务学习的可行性，设计共享和特定表示学习框架，并证明解混的最优解存在性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验证明了SMILE方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SMILE通过理论支持和框架设计，成功提升了高光谱解混性能，并验证了超分辨率对解混的积极引导作用。

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Copula理论的多时相高光谱解混方法（Cog-TD），通过显式建模时间依赖性，解决了现有方法在动态材料演化中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模时间依赖性方面存在局限，无法捕捉动态材料演化。Copula理论能显式建模依赖结构，因此被引入以改进多时相高光谱解混。

Method: 提出了Cog-TD方法，包括数学模型、Copula引导框架和两个关键模块（Copula函数估计和时间依赖性引导），并提供了理论支持。

Result: 实验结果表明，Cog-TD在合成和真实数据集上均有效，能够准确估计动态端元和丰度。

Conclusion: Cog-TD通过显式建模时间依赖性，显著提升了多时相高光谱解混的性能，为动态材料演化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

TL;DR: 3DAeroRelief是首个专为灾后评估设计的3D基准数据集，填补了现有数据集中在城市或室内场景的空白，通过低成本无人机采集数据，支持灾后响应中的3D场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有灾后评估主要依赖2D图像，缺乏深度信息且易受遮挡，而现有3D数据集多关注城市或室内场景，忽略了灾后环境的需求。

Method: 使用低成本无人机采集数据，通过Structure-from-Motion和Multi-View Stereo技术重建密集3D点云，并通过2D标注投影生成3D语义标注。

Result: 3DAeroRelief数据集提供了大规模室外灾后环境的精细3D结构损伤信息，为灾后响应中的3D场景理解提供了新资源。

Conclusion: 3DAeroRelief为灾后场景中的3D视觉系统研究提供了重要支持，展示了无人机在灾后数据采集中的潜力。

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEMMNet的新型生成增强多模态学习网络，用于解决多模态遥感数据在缺失模态情况下的语义分割问题，并在性能上超越了现有生成和非生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在现实场景中常因传感器故障或恶劣天气导致模态缺失，现有生成方法（如AE和GAN）在遥感语义分割中效果不佳，无法充分捕捉复杂场景的语义上下文且易受主导模态的偏见影响。

Method: GEMMNet包含三个关键组件：HyFEx（混合特征提取器）、HyFMA（多尺度感知的混合融合模块）和CoLoss（互补损失方案），旨在有效学习模态特定表示、跨尺度语义上下文并减轻模态偏见。

Result: 在Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上，GEMMNet超越了生成基线（AE、cGAN）和先进非生成方法（mmformer、shaspec）。

Conclusion: GEMMNet通过生成增强和多模态协同学习，显著提升了遥感语义分割在模态缺失情况下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

Result: 在野外视频上PSNR平均提升2.22，支持高质量的烟雾重建和动态编辑。

Conclusion: 方法在烟雾重建和编辑上优于现有技术，提供了模型、数据和4D烟雾资产。

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our
smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at

TL;DR: SVR-GS提出了一种空间变体正则化方法，通过局部像素级掩码优化高斯数量，显著减少了高斯数量并保持了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MaskGS）的全局掩码正则化与局部像素级重建损失不匹配，导致优化效果不佳。

Method: SVR-GS通过渲染每个高斯沿射线的有效贡献生成局部掩码，并探索了三种空间掩码聚合策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SVR-GS平均减少了1.79倍（相比MaskGS）和5.63倍（相比3DGS）的高斯数量，PSNR仅下降0.50 dB和0.40 dB。

Conclusion: SVR-GS显著提升了模型的紧凑性和效率，适用于实时应用如机器人、AR/VR和移动感知。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

Motivation: 珊瑚的复杂形态使得准确估计其体积和表面积具有挑战性，而高效的礁石监测需要这些量化数据。

Result: 方法在准确性和泛化性上表现优异，适用于未见过的珊瑚形态。

Conclusion: 该框架为直接从稀疏图像集高效估计珊瑚几何形状提供了可能，适用于珊瑚生长分析和礁石监测。

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Abstract: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical
reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on
TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic
data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario
generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法依赖RGB光谱信息，而多光谱数据的引入带来了高成本、低精度和几何特征差的问题。NeRF及其改进模型无法处理多波段信息。

Method: 提出Multispectral-NeRF，通过扩展隐藏层维度、重新设计残差函数和调整数据压缩模块，有效整合多光谱信息。

Result: 实验证明Multispectral-NeRF能准确处理多波段光谱特征并保留场景的光谱特性。

Conclusion: Multispectral-NeRF为多光谱3D重建提供了高精度、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SPHERE有效提升了场景补全的几何细节和语义准确性。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN和VAE的图像隐藏模型常面临模式崩溃问题，导致隐藏和提取信息不平衡。

Method: 提出StegOT模型，结合最优传输理论，设计MCOT模块将多峰特征分布转换为单峰，实现信息平衡。

Result: 实验表明，StegOT在隐藏和恢复图像质量上均有提升，且实现了信息平衡。

Conclusion: StegOT有效解决了模式崩溃问题，提升了图像隐藏和恢复的性能。

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Fitzpatrick皮肤色调（FST）量表的粒度对AI皮肤病变分类模型性能和偏见的影响，发现FST分组粒度对模型性能有显著影响，并建议在公平AI研究中采用更代表肤色多样性的替代量表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FST量表在肤色分类中存在对浅肤色更细粒度的偏见，可能影响AI模型的公平性和性能，因此需要研究其影响并探索替代方案。

Method: 通过训练多个AI模型，使用不同粒度的FST特定数据分类良性vs.恶性病变，比较模型性能。

Result: 使用三组FST数据（FST 1/2, 3/4, 5/6）训练的模型性能优于平衡数据模型；减少FST粒度（如合并1/2和3/4）会降低性能。

Conclusion: FST分组的粒度对模型性能至关重要，建议在公平AI研究中采用更代表肤色多样性的替代量表。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

<details>

Motivation: 现有公开的3D森林数据集规模不足，无法构建鲁棒的树分割系统，而合成数据在其他领域（如自动驾驶）的成功应用启发了其在森林视觉任务中的探索。

Method: 开发了一种新的合成数据生成流程，结合游戏引擎和基于物理的LiDAR模拟，生成大规模、多样化的标注3D森林数据集。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据预训练后仅需微调0.1公顷的真实数据，即可达到与全量真实数据训练模型相当的分割效果。

Conclusion: 合成数据在树分割任务中具有潜力，关键成功因素包括物理模拟、多样性和规模，为未来更鲁棒的3D森林视觉系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.

Abstract: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has
never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made
strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images
captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond
Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to
facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories.
Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine
grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a
marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental
validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a
spectrum of applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类对几何变化（如方向、尺度和透视变形）敏感，现有等变架构计算资源需求高且限制假设空间。

Method: 将仿射变换分解为旋转、缩放和剪切，使用共享定位编码器在几何约束下回归每个组件，并通过高斯变分后验建模不确定性。

Result: 在蛾类分类基准测试中，该方法相比其他STN显著提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的概率化STN扩展方法灵活、主干无关且无架构限制，有效提升了FGVC的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

Conclusion: CCoMAML与MHAFF结合的方法在牛只识别中表现优异，适应性强且高效。

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Motivation: 传统基于KL散度的贝叶斯方法在对抗攻击和自然噪声下表现脆弱，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用Hellinger距离特征聚合方案和新型Hellinger相似性对比损失函数，结合注意力机制。

Result: 在对抗扰动（ε=0.30）和高斯噪声（σ=0.30）下表现鲁棒，miniImageNet上1-shot和5-shot分别提升1.20%和1.40%，FID得分2.75优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ANROT-HELANet通过Hellinger距离和新型损失函数，在小样本学习中实现了性能和鲁棒性的新突破。

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both
adversarial and natural perturbations. Our code repository will be available at

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of
modality-specific discrete encoding.

Motivation: 现实监控系统中，行人重识别面临换衣和持续学习的挑战，现有方法通常只针对单一任务，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出CMLReID框架，包含上下文感知语义提示（CASP）和自适应知识融合与投影（AKFP）两个任务，通过多粒度视觉与语义对齐及双路径学习实现。

Conclusion: CMLReID有效解决了持续学习中的换衣和同衣行人重识别问题，为复杂场景提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of
sequential learning.

Motivation: 传统CI-UDA方法需要存储历史目标样本并仅对齐共享类别，导致内存持续增长和知识遗忘。本文旨在通过挖掘域不变和类别无关知识来避免这些问题。

Method: 利用CLIP提取类别无关属性，并通过“键值对”表示属性（键为视觉原型，值为文本提示）。维护两个域的属性字典，并通过视觉注意力一致性和预测一致性进行跨域对齐。

Result: 在三个CI-UDA基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法，有效减少了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 通过属性建模和跨域对齐，本文方法在无需历史样本的情况下，成功缓解了域偏移和知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

Conclusion: ROSGS通过两阶段设计和混合光照模型，有效解决了户外场景重光照的挑战，为相关应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

Conclusion: APASI是一种高效且通用的方法，无需外部依赖即可持续改进LVLM的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

Conclusion: 几何先验的引入显著提升了未对齐场景变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

Result: 在大规模合成和真实数据集上表现优异，定位召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: UnLoc在准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，尤其在长序列和短序列定位中表现突出。

Abstract: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SIKNet的学习辅助滤波器，用于多目标跟踪中的运动估计，优于传统卡尔曼滤波器和现有学习辅助滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卡尔曼滤波器在参数不匹配或目标非平稳运动时表现不佳，需要更鲁棒和准确的方法。

Method: 使用语义独立编码器（SIE）分两步编码状态向量，结合1D卷积和全连接层处理语义信息。

Result: SIKNet在运动估计中表现优于传统卡尔曼滤波器和现有学习辅助滤波器。

Conclusion: SIKNet在多目标跟踪中提供了更鲁棒和准确的运动估计。

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该博士研究探讨了医学图像计算中长距离视觉依赖建模的有效方法，比较了Transformer和MLP的优劣，发现MLP在捕捉高分辨率医学图像的细粒度依赖上更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析需要同时捕捉全局和局部特征，现有方法如CNN和Transformer各有局限，MLP作为高效替代方案尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究首先创新性地应用Transformer处理像素级和图像级任务，随后重点开发基于MLP的视觉模型，以建模医学图像中的细粒度长距离依赖。

Result: 实验证明长距离依赖建模对医学图像分析至关重要，MLP在高分辨率特征上表现优于Transformer和CNN。

Conclusion: MLP成为医学视觉任务的新范式，显著提升性能并为下一代医学视觉模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，利用双波段热成像分离反射和发射光成分，用于估计材料发射率和动态温度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在近环境条件下，反射和发射光成分通常相当且随时间变化，传统方法无法有效分离。

Method: 使用两台光谱敏感度不同的热成像相机，建立双波段热成像模型，开发算法估计发射率和动态温度。

Result: 通过校准材料发射率定量评估，并在复杂场景（如热液体玻璃杯和移动人物）中展示定性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了动态背景下反射和发射光成分的有效分离，为计算机视觉应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajTrack是一种基于轨迹的3D单目标跟踪方法，通过历史轨迹学习运动连续性，显著提升跟踪精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有两帧方法缺乏长期时间上下文和序列方法计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出轻量级框架TrajTrack，结合显式运动提议和隐式运动建模模块。

Result: 在NuScenes基准测试中，跟踪精度提升4.48%，运行速度为56 FPS。

Conclusion: TrajTrack在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

*Huaiyuan Qin,Muli Yang,Siyuan Hu,Peng Hu,Yu Zhang,Chen Gong,Hongyuan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了在实例一致性不保证的情况下自监督学习（SSL）的有效性，发现适度的视图多样性可以提升性能，但过度多样性会降低效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SSL依赖实例一致性假设，但在非标志性数据中，不同视图可能包含不同对象或语义信息，因此需要研究实例一致性不保证时的SSL效果。

Method: 通过大量消融实验，分析SSL在正对缺乏严格实例一致性时的表现，并采用Earth Mover's Distance（EMD）量化视图间的互信息。

Result: 适度的视图多样性（如零重叠或较小裁剪尺度）能提升分类和密集预测任务性能，但过度多样性会降低效果。EMD值适中时SSL学习效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来SSL框架设计提供了见解，验证了结果在多种数据源中的鲁棒性和适用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LiDAR在3D感知中很重要，但其生成技术仍未被充分探索，尤其是在可控性、时间稳定性和评估方面。

Method: 通过解析指令生成场景图，利用三分支扩散模型处理对象布局、轨迹和形状，再通过范围图像扩散模型和自回归模块生成连贯序列。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，LiDARCrafter在保真度、可控性和时间一致性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为基于LiDAR的仿真和数据增强提供了基础。

Abstract: While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data
augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种正则化策略，通过增强形状偏置表示来提高CNN对常见图像损坏的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN依赖局部纹理而非全局形状，导致对常见图像损坏的脆弱性，而人类却能轻松处理。

Method: 1. 辅助损失函数强制原始输入与低频滤波输入的特征一致性；2. 监督对比学习构建围绕类一致形状表示的特征空间。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C基准测试中，两种方法均提高了鲁棒性且不影响干净数据的准确性。

Conclusion: 损失级别的正则化能有效引导CNN学习更具形状感知和鲁棒性的表示。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

Motivation: 现有视频详细描述方法采用局部到全局的范式，导致描述细节不足且上下文不一致。

Method: 提出GLaVE-Cap框架，包含TrackFusion模块（利用视觉专家生成局部描述）和CaptionBridge模块（建立局部-全局交互）。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到最优性能，并通过消融实验验证了模块有效性。

Conclusion: GLaVE-Cap框架和GLaVE-1.2M数据集对视频理解社区有重要贡献，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for

sensing for consistent contact, achieves a mean absolute error of 12.55 micron
on wrinkle-like test objects. In a study with 15 participants without skin
disorders, we provide the first validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple

wrinkle height at three locations following over-the-counter moisturizer

Conclusion: 动态遗忘门机制对预测多样化现实场景中的人类行为至关重要。

Abstract: We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our
results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for
reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法简化了高斯溅射的动画实现，适用于任何引擎。

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

Method: 通过后验旋转潜在空间，主动学习域偏移，实现生物和技术因素的解耦。

Result: 在真实临床数据上，解耦表示显著提高了聚类一致性（ARI +19.01%，NMI +16.85%，Dice +12.39%），并优于四种现有方法。

Conclusion: 该无标签框架有助于在多中心常规影像数据中发现生物标志物，提升了生存预测能力。

Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This
supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies
not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology
linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting
domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery
of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we
introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation
of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical
factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the
learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing
tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is
improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the
entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization
methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival
prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates
biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外与可见光图像融合（IVIF）在多模态感知中至关重要，但现有方法未能充分建模模态间交互和任务关键区域。

Method: FusionNet采用模态感知注意力机制动态调整特征贡献，结合像素级alpha混合模块自适应学习融合权重，并引入目标感知损失优化语义一致性。

Result: 在M3FD数据集上，FusionNet生成的融合图像在语义保留、感知质量和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FusionNet为语义感知的多模态图像融合提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案，有助于下游任务如目标检测和场景理解。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

*Wenhao Tang,Sheng Huang,Heng Fang,Fengtao Zhou,Bo Liu,Qingshan Liu*

TL;DR: MHIM-MIL是一种新型MIL框架，通过掩码硬实例挖掘提升计算病理学中的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法偏向易分类实例，忽视硬实例，而硬实例对建模判别边界至关重要。

Method: 采用Siamese结构和一致性约束，利用动量教师掩码显著实例并隐式挖掘硬实例训练学生模型。

Result: 在癌症诊断、亚型分类和生存分析等12个基准测试中，MHIM-MIL在性能和效率上均优于最新方法。

Conclusion: MHIM-MIL通过挖掘硬实例显著提升了WSI分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了不同目标的语义差异和细粒度频率特征，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出SFGNet，结合语义提示和频域特征；设计MBFM处理复杂背景和模糊边界；ISEB模块确保预测的结构完整性和边界细节。

Result: 在三个COD基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SFGNet通过语义和频率引导，有效提升了伪装物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained
frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency
Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and
frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary
perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the
ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.
In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to
ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive
experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The core code of
the model is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 提出三种零样本辅助推理方法，通过提供空间线索（如轴、网格和标记交点）来提升视觉语言模型在GUI定位任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在GUI定位任务中表现不佳，尤其是输出显式坐标时，但其潜在定位能力（通过Pointing Game衡量）较强。

Method: 提出三种零样本辅助推理方法，包括提供轴、网格和标记交点等空间线索，以激活模型的隐式空间理解能力。

Result: 在四个GUI定位基准测试和七个开源及专有视觉语言模型上验证，结果显示方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过简单且无需额外数据的方法，有效提升了视觉语言模型在GUI定位任务中的表现。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

*Zhexi Peng,Kun Zhou,Tianjia Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS-SLAM提出了一种结合高斯和SDF的混合表示方法，显著提升了计算性能，达到150 fps，同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯的SLAM方法计算性能不足（<20 fps），主要由于高斯建模和优化的计算负担过重。

Method: 采用高斯-SDF混合表示，SDF用于平滑几何和外观，高斯用于细节捕捉，减少高斯数量和优化迭代。

Result: GPS-SLAM在真实数据集上达到150 fps，速度提升一个数量级，重建质量与现有技术相当。

Conclusion: 混合表示方法有效解决了计算瓶颈，为实时高质量3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层身份学习（HIL）框架，通过多中心对比学习和双向反向选择传输机制，解决了无监督可见-红外行人重识别中的细粒度差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过聚类对比学习减少模态差异，但忽略了细粒度差异。HIL框架旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用二级聚类生成多个记忆，结合多中心对比学习（MCCL）和双向反向选择传输（BRST）机制。

Result: 在SYSU-MM01和RegDB数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIL框架有效提升了无监督跨模态行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决多类图像分类中类别分布不均导致的偏差和方差问题，尤其是在需要优先考虑某些类别的场景。

Method: 提出迭代框架BiCDO，确定每类图像的最优数量，优化数据分布，可无缝集成到现有训练流程中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和iNaturalist21数据集上验证，使用EfficientNet等模型，展示了平衡且提升的性能。

Conclusion: BiCDO通过优化类别分布，有效提升模型性能，适用于多类分类任务。

Abstract: We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using
EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets,
demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data
distribution.

Result: 实验表明，MVQA-68K在内部测试集和公开基准测试中均达到最先进水平，并显著提升了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: MVQA-68K通过多维度标注和推理过程，提升了VQA任务的全面性和可解释性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning
process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HyGDL框架，通过生成-判别混合学习解决自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，实现内容与风格的显式解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）因捷径学习（依赖表面特征）而泛化能力受限，现有方法未能从根本上改变学习机制。

Method: 提出HyGDL框架，基于不变性预训练原则，通过单编码器实现内容与风格的向量投影正交解耦。

Result: HyGDL通过系统性偏置变化学习不变性，解决了捷径依赖问题。

Conclusion: HyGDL从机制上改进自监督学习，为跨域泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于帧级或视频级任务，无法全面评估模型泛化能力，因此需要更全面的方法。

Method: 采用softmax帧分配策略，优先选择异常密集片段，同时保持全视频覆盖，构建了图像和视频两个基准测试。

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上，帧级和视频级任务均取得改进，异常聚焦采样优于均匀和随机基线。

Conclusion: 提出的策略和基准测试为视频异常检测提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level
tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first
introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes
anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced
sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two
complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level
reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends
to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

Result: 在多视角渲染质量和3D一致性上显著优于现有2D方法。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了3D建模与深度伪造合成之间的空白，揭示了3D高斯泼溅技术可能被用于操纵攻击的威胁。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and
reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

Motivation: 解决传统扩散模型中随机初始化种子导致修复结果不一致的问题。

Method: 使用来自未掩码区域的初始种子模拟数据分布，并引入动态选择性细化机制。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ、ImageNet和Places2数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS-Diff是一种无需训练的高效修复方法，显著提升了修复质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

Result: 数据集提供精确对齐的退化与干净图像，为任务特定、通用和统一修复方法提供基准。

Conclusion: 该数据集为真实场景中的多天气图像修复研究提供了重要基础，并已公开。

Abstract: Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development
and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale,
real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck
in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,
and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The
resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and
all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable
foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in
real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released and is available

Abstract: OCTA is a crucial non-invasive imaging technique for diagnosing and

segmentation offer insufficient accuracy. To address this, we propose RVMamba,
a novel architecture integrating multiple feature extraction modules with the
Mamba state-space model. Moreover, existing joint segmentation models for OCTA
data exhibit performance imbalance between different tasks. To simultaneously
improve the segmentation of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and mitigate this
imbalance, we introduce FAZMamba and a unified Joint-OCTAMamba framework.

Result: 在极有限真实样本下，DTGen能合成无限高质量样本，显著提升分类器性能，支持细粒度识别。

Conclusion: DTGen验证了生成AI在少样本工业视觉中的价值，为自动化餐具清洁和食品安全监测提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and

Motivation: 解决固定分辨率分块导致的图像处理退化问题，提升对视觉密集内容（如复杂图表）的处理能力，同时在Ascend NPU上实现高效训练。

Method: 采用原生分辨率Vision Transformers，开发Mindspeed-MLLM分布式训练框架，三阶段训练（预热、多任务训练、监督指令调优），以及多模态数据打包和混合并行技术。

Result: 在评估中性能与Qwen2.5-VL相当，OCR表现领先，且仅使用其1/10的训练数据。

Conclusion: MindVL通过优化设计和训练策略，在高效训练和性能上取得平衡，适用于复杂视觉内容处理。

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纸质地图仍广泛用于徒步和观光，因其包含数字导航应用（如Google Maps）中缺失的精选路径和本地相关注释。

Method: 结合地理配准、U-Net二值分割、图构建和基于路由引擎的迭代优化流程。

Abstract: Paper maps remain widely used for hiking and sightseeing because they contain
curated trails and locally relevant annotations that are often missing from
digital navigation applications such as Google Maps. We propose a pipeline to
extract navigable trails from scanned maps, enabling their use in GPS-based
navigation. Our method combines georeferencing, U-Net-based binary
segmentation, graph construction, and an iterative refinement procedure using a
routing engine. We evaluate the full end-to-end pipeline as well as individual
components, showing that the approach can robustly recover trail networks from
diverse map styles and generate GPS routes suitable for practical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出工业金属数据集（IMD），填补现有6D姿态估计基准在工业场景中的不足，评估现有模型在工业环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要针对日常物体，缺乏对工业场景中金属、无纹理和高反射物体的覆盖，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含45个真实工业组件的IMD数据集，支持视频分割、6D姿态跟踪和单次6D姿态估计任务，并评估现有先进模型。

Result: 工业数据集比日常物体数据集更具挑战性，为工业机器人场景的算法开发提供了基准。

Conclusion: IMD数据集填补了工业场景的空白，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation
and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics
scenarios.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中不确定性估计对诊断至关重要，但传统Deep Ensembles方法计算成本高。

Method: 提出Ensemble Distillation，将多个集成模型的知识蒸馏到单一模型中。

Result: 在DRIVE和FIVES数据集上，性能与传统方法相当，但计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: Ensemble Distillation为视网膜血管分割提供高效可靠的不确定性估计方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and
reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal
vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.

Motivation: 扩展‘主键滤波器假设’，探索深度可分离卷积网络中滤波器的通用性。

Method: 通过无监督搜索提取8个通用滤波器，并在不同架构和数据集上验证其有效性。

Result: 使用这8个冻结滤波器初始化的网络在ImageNet上达到80%准确率，在小数据集上优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 深度卷积层会自然趋向于这组基础空间算子，为理解泛化和迁移学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered
universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these
fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,
networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%
ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable
parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters
closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,
structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also
strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers
naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless
of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding
generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these
master key filters.

Abstract: This technical report documents the development of novel Layout Analysis
models integrated into the Docling document-conversion pipeline. We trained
several state-of-the-art object detectors based on the RT-DETR, RT-DETRv2 and
DFINE architectures on a heterogeneous corpus of 150,000 documents (both openly

evaluated the effectiveness of the layout analysis on various document
benchmarks using different methodologies while also measuring the runtime
performance across different environments (CPU, Nvidia and Apple GPUs). We
introduce five new document layout models achieving 20.6% - 23.9% mAP
improvement over Docling's previous baseline, with comparable or better
runtime. Our best model, "heron-101", attains 78% mAP with 28 ms/image

qualitative experiments establish best practices for training, evaluating, and
deploying document-layout detectors, providing actionable guidance for the

Motivation: 轨迹数据在自动地图推断中具有低成本、广覆盖和持续可用性，但密度不均导致稀疏区域道路碎片化和密集区域冗余段，现有方法难以应对。

Method: DGMap采用多尺度网格编码、掩码增强关键点提取和全局上下文感知关系预测，结合全局语义上下文与局部几何特征。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，DGMap的APLS指标优于现有方法5%，在滴滴出行平台数据上表现突出。

Conclusion: DGMap通过全局上下文感知有效减少了稀疏区域的碎片化和密集区域的误连接，提升了地图推断的准确性。

Abstract: Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to
its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven
trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and
redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing
methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework
with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding,
Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation
Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric
features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road
fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global
Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in
dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on
trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform

Motivation: 现实临床环境中标记数据稀缺且任务特定模型泛化能力有限，阻碍了通用临床AI模型的发展。

Method: 提出EchoCare，采用自监督学习在包含450万张超声图像的EchoCareData上训练，并引入分层分类器联合学习像素级和表征级特征。

Result: EchoCare在10个代表性超声基准测试中优于现有模型，涵盖疾病诊断、病灶分割等多种任务。

Conclusion: EchoCare为临床超声AI提供了开放、可扩展的基础模型，推动了多样化应用的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound
representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for
advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in
real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of
task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI
models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel
ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via
self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale
dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images,
sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse
range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are
multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt
off-the-shelf vision foundation model architectures, we introduce a
hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level
and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts
and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare
outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative
ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease
diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction,
quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code
and pretrained model are publicly released, rendering EchoCare accessible for
fine-tuning and local adaptation, supporting extensibility to additional
applications. EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model
to boost the development of AI technologies for diverse clinical ultrasound
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多样化的非约束环境下难以捕捉多尺度和详细特征，导致重建不完整或不准确。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，部分情况下超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: MSMA框架显著提升了3D人脸重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

TL;DR: Seg2Track-SAM2是一个无需微调、检测器无关的框架，结合了预训练对象检测器与SAM2，通过Seg2Track模块解决了跟踪初始化、管理和强化问题，在KITTI MOTS基准测试中表现优异，并显著降低了内存使用。


<details>

Motivation: 多目标跟踪（MOT）在动态环境中至关重要，但现有方法在身份管理和内存效率方面存在不足。

Method: 集成预训练对象检测器与SAM2，引入Seg2Track模块处理跟踪问题，采用滑动窗口内存策略减少内存消耗。

Result: 在KITTI MOTS基准测试中排名第四，关联精度（AssA）创下新纪录，内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: Seg2Track-SAM2通过零样本跟踪、增强身份保持和高效内存利用，推动了MOTS的发展。

Abstract: Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to
operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results
confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot
tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization. The

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less
than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images,
demonstrating strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained,

multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes
both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机辅助诊断系统使用的标签过于简化，忽略了诊断的不确定性，导致模型在面对噪声或模糊输入时过于自信。

Method: 通过神经网络训练动态评估每个训练样本的固有难度，并在训练过程中聚合和校准模型预测，生成不确定性感知伪标签。

Result: 在超声心动图分类基准测试中，该方法在校准、选择性分类和多视图融合方面优于专用基线。

Conclusion: 该方法架构无关，可应用于任何监督学习流程，提高了不确定性估计和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Conclusion: LFRA-Net在分割精度和计算成本之间取得了理想平衡，适合资源有限的实时临床应用。

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推理速度受视觉令牌数量影响，传统推测解码方法直接应用于VLMs时面临计算和内存压力。

Method: 提出SpecVLM系统，结合EAGLE-2风格基线EagleVLM和弹性视觉压缩器，并采用在线蒸馏协议训练草稿模型。

Result: SpecVLM在LLaVA和MMMU上实现2.5--2.9倍加速，且保持目标模型的输出分布无损。

Conclusion: SpecVLM为VLMs提供了一种高效、无损的推理加速方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未从宏观任务层面探讨像素级图像融合与跨模态特征融合感知任务之间的相互促进作用。

Method: 提出并行结构的MAFS网络，包含融合子网络和分割子网络，采用异构特征融合策略和多阶段Transformer解码器。

Result: 实验表明，MAFS在图像融合和语义分割任务上均取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: MAFS通过任务级协同和多任务动态权重分配，有效提升了图像融合和语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的概率验证框架，结合了基于采样的可达性分析和保形推断，为语义分割网络提供可靠的安全保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率验证方法难以应对现代分割任务的复杂性和高维度，导致保证过于保守。

Method: 结合采样可达性分析和保形推断，提出新策略以减少保守性。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，方法显著收紧边界并提供可靠安全保证。

Conclusion: 框架具有架构无关性和可扩展性，适用于高维输出任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式视觉语言模型在高层图像理解上表现优异，但在视觉与语言模态的密集对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 利用VLMs生成合成描述，并将其与图像密集对齐，以提升零样本密集任务的性能。

Result: 在标准零样本开放词汇分割基准上优于先前工作，且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: 合成描述是一种低成本、可扩展且高效的密集对齐方法，为视觉语言对齐提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image
understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language
modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative
VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDI-GS通过区域分割优化3D高斯分布，减少50%高斯数量，保持渲染质量，提升训练速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图合成中，现有方法依赖SfM或MVS，导致高内存消耗和低效。

Method: 利用区域分割识别关键区域，选择性降采样密集点云。

Result: 高斯数量减少50%，渲染质量接近或优于现有方法，训练更快、内存占用更低。

Conclusion: SDI-GS提升了3DGS在稀疏视图场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of
recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time
rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that
struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods
replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers
of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for
constrained-view scenarios.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视频问答中依赖浅层关联，导致时序定位弱和可解释性差，需要更结构化的中间表示。

Method: 提出SG-VLM框架，通过提示和视觉定位将场景图与冻结的视觉语言模型结合。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，SG-VLM在因果和时序推理上优于基线，但对强视觉语言模型的提升有限。

Conclusion: 符号化中间表示有潜力，但当前效果有限，为未来混合方法提供了方向。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise
and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future
hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance
video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from
hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,
temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained
spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark
dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes
10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched
with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in
LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the
perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This
step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively
identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is
effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and
reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in
real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at

Motivation: 精准畜牧业需要先进的监测工具，而现有的MAT工具在多动物追踪中表现不佳，影响下游任务准确性。

Method: 研究对DeepLabCut、idTracker等MAT工具和ByteTrack、DeepSORT等MOT方法进行了基准测试，使用10分钟的猪群追踪数据集。

Result: MOT方法在长期追踪场景中表现优于传统MAT工具。

Conclusion: 近期MOT技术有望提升畜牧业自动化追踪的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

Result: 生成的图像语义更丰富，上下文更准确。

Conclusion: 这是首次将加权提示操作技术应用于诗歌图像生成，为文学领域的视觉化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted
prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

Conclusion: SAM-TTT显著提升语义理解能力，为COD领域设新标杆。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

TL;DR: Brea-Depth是一种新的支气管镜深度估计框架，通过整合气道几何先验知识，提升了深度估计的准确性和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度基础模型在支气管镜场景中缺乏解剖学意识，容易过拟合局部纹理，无法捕捉全局气道结构。

Method: 提出Brea-Depth框架，结合深度感知CycleGAN和气道结构感知损失，优化深度估计。

Result: 在体外人类肺数据集和开放支气管镜数据集中，Brea-Depth在解剖深度保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Brea-Depth通过整合解剖先验知识，显著提升了支气管镜深度估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

Motivation: 现有方法在有效学习类别间关系和清晰区分分布内外数据方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 在logit空间混合分布内外数据，并强制logit空间与输入空间的一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法减少了决策边界附近的输出波动，提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在细粒度分布外检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义场景图方法依赖传感器数据且需完整场景重建，限制了在真实增量场景中的应用。

Result: 在3DSSG数据集上验证，多模态信息（如CLIP）增强了模型的扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为复杂真实环境提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

TL;DR: NeuroGaze-Distill通过跨模态蒸馏框架，将脑电信号中的情感先验知识迁移到仅基于图像的FER模型中，提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于像素的FER模型因面部外观是情感的间接且有偏代理，难以跨数据集泛化。

Method: 利用EEG地形图训练的教师模型生成V/A原型网格，学生模型通过Proto-KD和D-Geo正则化学习这些先验知识。

Result: 方法在FERPlus和跨数据集测试中表现稳健，5x5原型网格效果最佳。

Conclusion: NeuroGaze-Distill简单易部署，无需复杂架构即可提升FER模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验验证了VMD策略的有效性。

Conclusion: VMD方法能够有效利用跨模态先验知识，提升对未标注3D MRI图像的诊断准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络（DNNs）通过随机初始化参数并使用随机梯度下降（SGD）优化，容易陷入局部最小值，导致性能不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题，特别是在图像插值任务中。

Method: 首先基于已知插值器初始化有向图邻接矩阵A，然后通过学习扰动矩阵P和P(2)来增强A，并通过Douglas-Rachford（DR）迭代实现恢复效果，最终将其展开为轻量级可解释神经网络。

Conclusion: 通过结合图滤波器和轻量级神经网络，本文提出了一种高效且可解释的图像插值方法，显著优于传统DNNs。

Abstract: Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

Motivation: 随着沉浸式应用的成功，需要新的方法来处理和优化360度图像和视频的传输，显著性估计是一个关键工具。

Method: 提出Sphere-GAN，利用生成对抗网络（GAN）和球形卷积进行360度视频的显著性检测。

Result: 在公开的360度视频显著性数据集上，Sphere-GAN的表现优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: Sphere-GAN为360度视频的显著性检测提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and
optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a
powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed
for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN,
a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative
Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were
conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately
predicting saliency maps.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CLAIRE的双编码器架构，结合光学和SAR图像，通过注意力融合模块和混合损失函数RIFT，显著提升了土地覆盖分类的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然景观复杂性、类别视觉相似性和数据集类别不平衡带来的土地覆盖分类挑战。

Method: 采用双编码器提取光学和SAR图像特征，通过CLAIRE模块融合，并使用RIFT混合损失函数处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如WHU-OPT-SAR的mIoU为56.02%，OA为84.56%，并在云遮挡条件下表现稳健。

Conclusion: CLAIRE模型在准确性、泛化性和解释性方面均表现出色，为土地覆盖分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance-aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations
(CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural
features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land
cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted
Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address
class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented
categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple
benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall
Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with
a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and
remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of
86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce
a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3),
which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中视觉输入通过连接器投影到语言模型嵌入空间时的信息损失，提出了两种方法来量化这种损失，并发现连接器会显著扭曲视觉表示的局部几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理视觉输入时，通过连接器将视觉信息投影到语言模型的嵌入空间中，但这一步骤可能导致信息损失，影响模型性能，目前对此的研究较少。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）通过分析投影前后图像表示的k近邻关系变化来评估语义信息保留；2）通过从投影表示中重建视觉嵌入，定位图像块级别的信息损失。

Result: 实验表明，连接器会显著扭曲视觉表示的局部几何结构，k近邻关系在投影后差异达40-60%，且与检索性能下降相关。重建方法揭示了模型在视觉问答任务中表现不佳的区域。

Conclusion: 连接器导致的信息损失会影响模型性能，研究为理解和改进视觉语言模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

TL;DR: SCORE是一种新型框架，用于在扩散模型中安全且鲁棒地擦除敏感概念，同时保持生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但也带来隐私、公平性和安全性风险，需要擦除敏感或有害概念。

Method: SCORE将概念擦除视为对抗独立性问题，最小化目标概念与生成输出之间的互信息，提供理论保证。

Result: SCORE在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，擦除效果提升12.5%，且保持图像质量。

Conclusion: SCORE通过对抗优化和轨迹一致性，为扩散模型中的概念擦除设定了新标准。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在极端场景下的局限性，如退化与图像结构强耦合的问题，并改善任务间性能不平衡、过拟合和泛化能力弱的问题。

Method: 采用三种关键设计：自适应语义感知掩码（AdaSAM）、掩码属性传导（MAC）和鲁棒特征正则化（RFR）。

Result: RAM++在已知、未知、极端和混合退化场景中实现了鲁棒、平衡且最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RAM++通过结合生成先验和内容先验，显著提升了图像恢复的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇遥感图像分割（OVRSIS）任务缺乏统一的评估基准，且自然图像与遥感图像之间存在领域差距，因此需要专门的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了RSKT-Seg框架，包含三个关键模块：多方向成本图聚合（RS-CMA）、高效成本图融合（RS-Fusion）和遥感知识迁移（RS-Transfer）。

Result: RSKT-Seg在基准测试中比现有基线方法提升了3.8 mIoU和5.9 mACC，同时推理速度提高了2倍。

Conclusion: RSKT-Seg通过专门设计的模块和知识迁移，显著提升了开放词汇遥感图像分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

Motivation: 解决自回归模型在布局条件图像生成中因稀疏布局条件和特征纠缠带来的挑战。

Method: 采用结构化掩码策略控制全局提示、布局和图像标记的交互，结合GRPO后训练和布局奖励函数。

Result: SMARLI在不影响生成质量的情况下，实现了布局感知控制，保持了自回归模型的简洁性和高效性。

Conclusion: SMARLI成功整合布局条件到自回归图像生成中，为布局控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

Abstract: Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal
welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,
traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and
limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages
open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal
behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines
state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking
and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for
robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal
occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig
monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset
for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall
accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing
methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%
identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular
design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further
validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision
pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN或扩散模型的说话头动画方法存在帧间闪烁、身份漂移和推理速度慢的问题，限制了其应用。

Method: AvatarSync采用两阶段生成策略：第一阶段（FKG）通过音素级语义表示生成关键帧，第二阶段通过时间感知自适应策略进行帧间插值。

Result: 实验表明，AvatarSync在视觉保真度、时间一致性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AvatarSync提供了一种可扩展且可控的解决方案，适用于说话头动画生成。

Abstract: Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

Result: 实验表明，跨群体数据增强减少了变异性，并在早期和晚期GA案例中均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提高姿态估计的可靠性，有助于早期临床检测和干预。

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

Conclusion: ImplMORe通过隐式表示解决了医学图像重建中的分辨率和计算资源问题，为诊断和手术规划提供了更精细的器官表面信息。

Abstract: The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state
space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural
constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In
addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks,
pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental
domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental
anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent
tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top
3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2
achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with

Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

TL;DR: RailSafeNet是一个实时框架，结合语义分割、目标检测和基于规则的距离评估器，通过单目视频提高电车与行人互动的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电车在人口密集区域运行，碰撞可能导致严重后果，因此需要一种智能解决方案提升安全性。

Method: 使用SegFormer B3和YOLOv8模型，结合距离评估器，识别轨道入侵并分类风险。

Result: 在RailSem19数据集上，SegFormer B3达到65% IoU，YOLOv8达到75.6% mAP。

Conclusion: RailSafeNet提供高精度、低标注的场景理解，能有效预警危险情况。

Abstract: Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams
frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from
minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the
perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians,
drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视觉推理模型Reflection-V，通过构建视觉中心推理数据和设计基于视觉注意力的奖励模型，显著提升了视觉反思能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉推理中表现出有限的视觉反思能力，注意力随生成响应变长而迅速减弱。

Method: 1. 构建视觉中心推理数据，通过VLMs与推理LLMs的交互实现冷启动学习；2. 在强化学习中设计基于视觉注意力的奖励模型。

Result: Reflection-V在多个视觉推理基准测试中表现显著提升，且对视觉信息的依赖更强、更一致。

Conclusion: Reflection-V有效增强了视觉反思能力，为视觉推理模型的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Vision Transformers和Graph Neural Network的深度学习框架，用于从sMRI数据中自动检测重度抑郁症（MDD），并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉复杂脑模式方面存在局限性，因此需要一种更高效的方法来提升MDD的诊断准确性。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers提取3D区域嵌入，并结合Graph Neural Network进行分类，探索了基于图谱和基于立方体的两种区域定义策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，最佳模型在10折交叉验证中达到了78.98%的准确率，基于图谱的方法表现优于基于立方体的方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合领域特定的解剖学先验知识对MDD检测至关重要，基于图谱的方法更具优势。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏层次性和细粒度时间标注，需要更高效的在线视频理解方法。

Method: 利用LLMs将原子动作分组为高级事件，提出OpenHOUSE系统，改进流式动作感知。

Result: OpenHOUSE在相邻动作边界检测上性能提升近一倍。

Conclusion: OpenHOUSE是流式动作感知与生成模型结合的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines
online temporal action localization with free-form description generation.
Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal
annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into
higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE
(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends
streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a
specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely
adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of
existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the
integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key
step in that direction.

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a ubiquitous in radiology, yet most existing AI foundation
models are limited to chest anatomy and fail to generalize across broader
clinical tasks. In this work, we introduce XR-0, the multi-anatomy X-ray
foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large, private dataset of

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for
fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose
Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of
this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and
inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3
and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different
adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to
determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental
results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to
traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and
training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实服装合成中因遮挡、复杂姿态和变形导致的泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 利用大规模真实视频数据和小规模合成3D数据，通过隐式训练优化共享的服装嵌入空间，生成360度视角的服装新视图。

Conclusion: HoloGarment通过结合真实与合成数据，显著提升了服装新视图合成的性能，适用于复杂真实场景。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动物行为研究中大规模数据标注成本高的问题，提出数据高效学习方法。

Method: 使用预训练的V-JEPA模型，并通过DAP（领域自适应预训练）进一步优化。

Result: 在PanAf和ChimpACT数据集上，分别提升6.1%准确率和6.3% mAP。

Conclusion: DAP无需标注数据即可显著提升性能，为动物行为识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in
ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps
allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a
bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient
learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised
learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two
datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published
state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt.
mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and
applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining
with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the
DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of
animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples. Code is available at

Method: 通过新收集的OmniWorld-Game数据集和多个公共数据集，构建了一个多模态、大规模的数据集，并基于此建立了基准测试。

Result: 在OmniWorld上微调现有SOTA方法显著提升了4D重建和视频生成任务的性能。

Conclusion: OmniWorld有望成为推动通用4D世界模型发展的关键资源。

Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

TL;DR: LazyDrag是一种基于拖拽的图像编辑方法，通过显式对应映射消除对隐式点匹配的依赖，提升扩散模型的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的编辑方法依赖隐式点匹配，导致反转强度减弱和测试时优化成本高，限制了扩散模型的高保真修复和文本引导生成能力。

Method: LazyDrag通过用户拖拽输入生成显式对应映射，作为可靠的参考来增强注意力控制，实现稳定的全强度反转过程。

Result: LazyDrag在DragBench上表现优于基线方法，支持多轮工作流和复杂编辑任务，如精确几何控制和文本引导生成。

Conclusion: LazyDrag不仅实现了最先进的性能，还为编辑范式开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core
bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on
weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This
compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,
suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,
we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on
implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit
correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the
attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable
full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing
task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability
of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with
text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:
opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects
like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes
like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round
workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the
DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual
quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to
editing paradigms.

Conclusion: 该方法在动画内容理解和无障碍访问方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and
imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing
recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by
conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme
diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we
propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated
character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of
animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an
audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual
exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent
multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.
Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream
applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired
audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support
research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated
movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline
demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative
comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

Result: 实验显示LEGO提升训练效率、加速收敛，支持可变分辨率生成，并显著减少采样时间。

Conclusion: LEGO是扩散模型的高效增强方案，兼具灵活性和性能优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating photo-realistic images but come with
significant computational costs in both training and sampling. While various
techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is
designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement.
Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on
resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating
images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training.
This study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature
Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to
create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective
skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution
images than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and
transform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent
full-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that
LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate
variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative
performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to
other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models.

Method: 结合LSTM的长时依赖学习能力和KAN的非线性逼近能力。

Result: 有效捕捉锂电池的复杂退化行为。

Conclusion: SOH-KLSTM框架在锂电池健康监测中表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable State Of Health (SOH) estimation for Lithium (Li)
batteries is critical to ensure the longevity, safety, and optimal performance
of applications like electric vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, consumer
electronics, and renewable energy storage systems. Conventional SOH estimation
techniques fail to represent the non-linear and temporal aspects of battery
degradation effectively. In this study, we propose a novel SOH prediction
framework (SOH-KLSTM) using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-Integrated
Candidate Cell State in LSTM for Li batteries Health Monitoring. This hybrid
approach combines the ability of LSTM to learn long-term dependencies for
accurate time series predictions with KAN's non-linear approximation
capabilities to effectively capture complex degradation behaviors in Lithium
batteries.

TL;DR: 论文比较了四种支持多视图符号回归（MvSR）的工具（Operon、PySR、phy-SO、eggp）在不同数据集上的表现，发现它们通常能生成高精度且参数少的模型，并提出了未来发展的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖第一性原理推导方程，而符号回归（SR）可以自动化部分过程。多视图符号回归（MvSR）能描述同一现象生成的多个数据集，减少过拟合和数据稀缺问题。

Method: 测试并比较了Operon、PySR、phy-SO和eggp四种工具在不同真实数据集上的MvSR实现。

Result: 这些工具通常能生成高精度且参数少的模型，但某些特性有助于更频繁地生成更好的模型。

Conclusion: 论文总结了MvSR工具的优缺点，并提出了未来发展的指导建议。

Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists
to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different
phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first
principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part
of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a
function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce
sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly
interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression
(MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple
datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common
problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations
added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we
test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in
different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good
accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we
find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models.
We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ZIDF的框架，用于处理降水预测中的零膨胀数据问题，结合高斯扰动、Transformer预测和扩散去噪技术，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水预测中零膨胀数据（大量零值和稀疏非零事件）带来了显著挑战，需要一种有效的方法来处理这种稀疏时间序列数据。

Method: ZIDF框架整合了高斯扰动（平滑零膨胀分布）、基于Transformer的预测（捕捉时间模式）和基于扩散的去噪（恢复原始数据结构）。

Result: 实验表明，ZIDF在多个先进降水预测模型中表现优异，MSE和MAE分别降低了56.7%和21.1%。

Conclusion: ZIDF能够稳健处理稀疏时间序列数据，并可能推广到其他零膨胀问题领域。

Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting
due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this,
we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates
Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions,
Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and
diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our
experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South
Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show
that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple
state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\%
reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline
Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly
handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to
other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

*Haolin Yuan,Jingtao Li,Weiming Zhuang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEDEXCHANGE提出了一种新的联邦目标检测框架，通过服务器端动态模型交换策略提升跨域性能，且不增加本地计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦目标检测方法忽视边缘设备硬件限制，且本地训练正则化计算成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: FEDEXCHANGE采用服务器端动态模型交换策略，交替进行模型聚合和模型交换，基于距离度量聚类和交换模型。

Result: FEDEXCHANGE在挑战性域（如雨天）中平均精度提升1.6倍，计算资源仅需基线方法的0.8倍。

Conclusion: FEDEXCHANGE有效提升跨域性能，且计算高效，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

### [152] [Retrosynthesis Planning via Worst-path Policy Optimisation in Tree-structured MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10504)
*Mianchu Wang,Giovanni Montana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于最坏路径优化的逆合成规划方法InterRetro，显著提升了合成路线的可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常优化平均性能，忽略了合成路线中最弱环节的敏感性，导致规划结果不可靠。

Method: 将逆合成重新定义为树状马尔可夫决策过程中的最坏路径优化问题，提出InterRetro方法，通过自模仿学习优化策略。

Result: 在Retro*-190基准测试中解决了100%的目标，合成路线缩短4.9%，且仅用10%训练数据即表现优异。

Conclusion: InterRetro在计算逆合成规划中取得了显著进展，为可靠合成路线设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available
building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents
an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable
reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid
building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in
the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance
across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this
paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within
tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this
formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement
guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis
Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a
value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through
self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated
advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving
100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by
4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data -
representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttnBoost是一种集成特征级注意力的提升框架，用于零售供应链中的产品需求预测，提高了预测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度提升决策树（GBDT）缺乏自适应机制来识别和强调变化条件下最相关的特征。

Method: AttnBoost通过轻量级注意力机制动态调整每轮提升中的特征重要性，重点关注促销、定价和季节性趋势等高影响力变量。

Result: 在大规模零售销售数据集上，AttnBoost优于标准机器学习和深度表格模型，并提供可操作的供应链管理见解。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的提升为现实世界预测应用中的可解释和可扩展AI提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex
challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer
behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer
strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive
mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing
conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning
framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to
enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model
dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a
lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables
such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a
large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard
machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable
insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of
the attention module in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability.
Our results suggest that attention-guided boosting represents a promising
direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了大型语言模型（LLM）在递归训练中会崩溃的传统理论，通过引入选择性反馈机制，实验证明该机制能逆转性能下降，称为反噬效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在递归训练中的稳定性问题，探索如何通过简单选择压力提升模型性能，为AI安全提供新思路。

Method: 引入选择性反馈机制，对比实验包括质量过滤、未过滤和随机过滤条件，使用Gemma 2B模型进行复杂摘要任务测试。

Result: 质量过滤条件下，模型性能在五代训练中提升6.6%（ROUGE-L F1），而未过滤和随机过滤组分别下降3.5%和4.2%。

Conclusion: 选择性反馈机制能诱导LLM的系统性韧性，为开发更安全、鲁棒的AI系统提供了可扩展原则。

Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a
foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse,
a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We
challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism.
Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments
provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a
statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a
complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect.
We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier,
where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique
dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic
resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure,
suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more
robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition
improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by
3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

TL;DR: LogGuardQ是一种新型强化学习框架，结合人类认知的双记忆系统和自适应探索策略，在动态环境中表现优于传统算法DQN和PPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法（如DQN和PPO）在动态环境中的探索效率、稳定性和适应性方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: LogGuardQ整合了双记忆系统和基于温度衰减与好奇心的自适应探索策略，并在100万条模拟访问日志数据集上进行了评估。

Result: LogGuardQ的异常检测率为96.0%（DQN为93.0%，PPO为47.1%），F1得分为0.6450，平均奖励为20.34±44.63，显著优于对比算法。

Conclusion: LogGuardQ通过结合认知科学与强化学习，为不确定环境中的自适应学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，适用于网络安全等领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and
adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive
Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a
dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration
strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of
1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes,
LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for
PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.
The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98
for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode
(constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves
smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends,
action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's
superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm
significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible
effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN
vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL,
LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain
environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion
detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: 建立Stackelberg博弈模型和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程，结合深度强化学习设计自适应算法。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的机制能有效平衡各方利益，提升联邦学习效率。

Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for
distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and
local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL
suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for
gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive
mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing
the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is
theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader
and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived
to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is
formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal
strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an
Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to
stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏MoE架构在指令调优场景中专家专业化不足的问题，尤其是在输入异质性显著的情况下。

Method: 采用双阶段路由机制：第一阶段基于序列级特征进行专家分组路由，第二阶段在组内激活令牌级top-k专家。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于基线模型，展现出更强的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoCE通过有效分区输入并提升专家专业化，显著提升了性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly
scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a
proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert
specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge
for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by
significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the
Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a
dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert
group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage
activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This
approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on
their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while
maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a
comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over
strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed
analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.

Conclusion: 研究强调了建立通用理论的必要性，提出的框架因其特征值与奇异值之间的数学联系而具有潜力。

Abstract: Continuous attractors are critical for information processing in both
biological and artificial neural systems, with implications for spatial
navigation, memory, and deep learning optimization. However, existing research
lacks a unified framework to analyze their properties across diverse dynamical
systems, limiting cross-architectural generalizability. This study establishes
a novel framework from the perspective of differential manifolds to investigate
continuous attractors in artificial neural networks. It verifies compatibility
with prior conclusions, elucidates links between continuous attractor phenomena
and eigenvalues of the local Jacobian matrix, and demonstrates the universality
of singular value stratification in common classification models and datasets.
These findings suggest continuous attractors may be ubiquitous in general
neural networks, highlighting the need for a general theory, with the proposed
framework offering a promising foundation given the close mathematical
connection between eigenvalues and singular values.

Result: 实验显示UAPO在非配对数据下表现优异，提高了数据利用效率和训练鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UAPO为偏好优化提供了更灵活高效的解决方案，减少了对数据配对的严格依赖。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language
models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning,
one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward
modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use
Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions,
including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution
shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we
propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods,
Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces
an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference
data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data
is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the
anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental
results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict
dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective
preference optimization methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育数字化带来数据驱动的个性化需求，但学生数据隐私问题突出，传统集中式推荐系统不符合现代数据保护法规。

Method: 使用联邦学习（FL）和深度神经网络（DNN），基于ASSISTments教育数据集，比较了多种联邦聚合策略，最终选择FedProx。

Result: 优化的联邦模型F1-Score达76.28%，性能为集中式XGBoost模型的82.85%，验证了联邦学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 联邦学习能有效解决教育平台中个性化与隐私的矛盾，提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.

Motivation: 解决临床数据隐私和统计异质性对机器学习模型开发的限制。

Result: FedProx在F1分数上表现最佳（0.8831），且收敛稳定。

Conclusion: 正则化联邦学习算法（如FedProx）在异构和不平衡临床预测任务中更有效。

Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital
mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of
real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions
requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of
five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and
FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we
simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care
unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek
technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,
conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based
strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the
highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the
baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive
performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that
regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and
effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks
than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a
crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for
real-world healthcare applications.

quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping, HKM
compresses knowledge substrates by 3x with 67% storage savings, integrates
holographically at 100%, and supports over 1,020 updates with 1% growth per
increment. In experiments on combined WikiText and FB15k datasets (scaled to
2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting
(infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training
time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project
$92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and
33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public
large language models (LLMs), enabling "eternal" adaptation without retraining.
Future extensions to multimodal fusion and quantum hardware could further
democratize scalable AI, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% for
models like Llama-3 or Grok-4. Code, datasets, and full results are publicly
available for reproducibility.

### [163] [Gradient Estimation Methods of Approximate Multipliers for High-Accuracy Retraining of Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10519)
*Chang Meng,Wayne Burleson,Giovanni De Micheli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法（LUT-2D和LUT-1D）来更精确计算近似乘法器的梯度，以提高深度学习模型重训练的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用精确乘法器的梯度估计近似乘法器的梯度，导致重训练结果不理想。

Method: LUT-2D使用二维查找表精细估计梯度；LUT-1D是更高效的变体，使用一维查找表。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，两种方法显著提高了重训练准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升近似乘法器在深度学习模型中的重训练效果。

Abstract: Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning
accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However,
AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a
retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing
the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate
product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically
estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which
can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two
methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D,
characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs),
providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining
accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant
that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable
retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on
CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods
improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On
ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining
accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining
framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“反事实样本识别”的新方法，通过比较实际动作与反事实动作来识别成功动作，避免了直接奖励模型的混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接奖励模型在动作和上下文输入时容易产生混淆，难以区分动作和上下文的影响。

Method: 采用反事实样本识别方法，学习识别成功动作，而非直接预测奖励。

Result: 在合成实验和实际部署中，该方法均优于直接模型。

Conclusion: 反事实样本识别方法有效解决了直接奖励模型的混淆问题，具有理论和实际优势。

Abstract: In production systems, contextual bandit approaches often rely on direct
reward models that take both action and context as input. However, these models
can suffer from confounding, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the
action from that of the context. We present \emph{Counterfactual Sample
Identification}, a new approach that re-frames the problem: rather than
predicting reward, it learns to recognize which action led to a successful
(binary) outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the
logging policy under the same context. The method is theoretically grounded and
consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and
real-world deployments.

TL;DR: VGM$^2$是一种基于几何的个性化联邦学习框架，通过变分高斯混合流形解决标签偏斜和非平稳性问题，仅交换几何摘要，实现高效通信和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化联邦学习在标签偏斜和非平稳性下表现不佳，因为单一全局参数化忽略了客户端特定的几何结构。

Method: VGM$^2$学习客户端特定的UMAP嵌入，建模潜在距离关系，并通过变分统计交换信息，服务器通过共轭矩匹配聚合。

Result: 在非独立同分布标签数据集上，VGM$^2$在测试F1分数上优于基线方法，同时通信开销低。

Conclusion: VGM$^2$通过几何建模和变分统计实现了高效、隐私保护的个性化联邦学习，具有稳定性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and
non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores
client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture
Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific
parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture
relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only
variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a
Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means,
and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form
global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation
minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors
within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further
incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report
communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID
label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared
to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy
is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy
noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and
configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.

Conclusion: 该研究为工作量评估、人员配置和调度提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense
airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and
efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that
integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to
estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset
between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command
duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected
using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble
model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.
By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of
its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value
for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.

Method: 采用两模块框架：1）基于跨域迁移学习的深度学习模型分类ASD；2）通过三种XAI技术（显著性映射、Grad-CAM、SHAP）解释模型决策和关键脑区。

Result: 跨域迁移学习有效缓解数据稀缺，XAI技术揭示了模型决策依据和ASD相关脑区，与神经生物学证据一致。

Conclusion: 框架兼具诊断性能和临床可解释性，为ASD研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer
learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably
limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with
two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep
learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a
deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD
classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions
and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three
explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This
framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively
address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three
established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes
diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.
These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence,
highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图表示和AutoML的神经网络剪枝新方法，通过全局视角和二进制动作空间优化剪枝策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法依赖手工启发式和局部优化，导致性能不佳和效率低下。

Method: 使用图注意力网络（GAT）编码网络拓扑结构，采用二进制动作空间和约束马尔可夫决策过程（CMDP）进行剪枝。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上表现优于传统方法，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法通过全局视角和任务特定策略，有效识别冗余连接，优于传统剪枝技术。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating
a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the
limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on
hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to
suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework
transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the
target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between
layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a
global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph
representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action
space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary
action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance
criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.
These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while
adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we
design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform
its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,
showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning
strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple
weight magnitude considerations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Latent Replay的方法，用于解决文本到图像扩散模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和模式崩溃问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习是自然智能的核心能力，但人工神经网络（尤其是文本到图像扩散模型）容易在学习新任务时遗忘旧知识（灾难性遗忘）或输出重复内容（模式崩溃）。

Method: 采用Latent Replay方法，通过存储模型内部的高层特征表示而非原始图像数据，减少内存占用并保留关键信息。

Result: 实验表明，Latent Replay在五个视觉概念的持续学习中表现优异，最早概念的图像对齐（IA）保留率达77.59%，比基线方法高14%，同时保持输出多样性。

Conclusion: Latent Replay为生成式AI模型的持续学习提供了高效解决方案，支持个性化文本到图像模型的低成本演进。

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态自适应共享专家和分组多头注意力混合模型（DASG-MoE），通过三个模块提升长序列建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Mixture of Experts（MoE）架构的Transformer模型在计算效率和长程依赖捕捉方面存在不足，尤其是专家资源分配的动态适应性。

Method: 1. 使用分组多头注意力（GMHA）降低长序列计算复杂度；2. 设计双尺度共享专家结构（DSSE）平衡效率与精度；3. 提出分层自适应动态路由（ADR）机制优化资源分配。

Result: 在多个长序列基准数据集上，DASG-MoE模型优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: DASG-MoE通过动态资源分配和高效注意力机制，显著提升了长序列建模能力。

Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have
made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still
have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture
long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of
expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared
Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance
long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we
employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce
the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through
sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we
address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for
local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure
(DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond
to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional
complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization,
achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose
a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically
selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and
optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy.
Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效适应市场变化，提升投资组合表现。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in
financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a
cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset
allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods
are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe
and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment
landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new
investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach
leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to
evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates
assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new
opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed
methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the
state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE旋转位置编码中内容与位置纠缠，影响性能，特别是在需要独立匹配时。

Method: 提出Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings (PoPE)，消除内容与位置的混淆。

Result: PoPE在诊断任务和序列建模中优于RoPE，支持零样本长度外推。

Conclusion: PoPE是一种更优的位置编码方案，适用于多种任务和模型规模。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

Motivation: 解决边缘用户任务特定偏好和域偏移问题，同时避免高成本训练和隐私风险。

Result: 在多个挑战性任务中表现优异，适应性强。

Conclusion: SG-LoRA为零样本开放世界中的个性化模型适配提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models,
especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications,
edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle
with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge
may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training
and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also
impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data
utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided
LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to
efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional
training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA
uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a
set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic
guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate
high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time
construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling
knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a
privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel
zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable
adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at

Result: 展示了在有限和无限维度中的数值和图解示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI开辟了新方向，包括曲率感知学习架构和在不确定或对抗环境中的拓扑正则化。

Abstract: We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by
allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \(
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even
infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling
of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor
dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision,
language, and quantum learning.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a
\emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along
cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or
"curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of
coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with
sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and
provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite
dimensions.
  This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning
architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial
environments.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中大批量训练导致的泛化性能下降问题，同时保持高效并行计算。

Method: 提出了一种新的大批量训练技术，结合小批量和大批量训练的优势。

Result: 在相同迭代次数下，ResNet50和VGG11模型的测试准确率分别提高了32.33%和3.74%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了并行计算效率和模型泛化性能，为联邦学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over
devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of
big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either
generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and
locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and
statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher
communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization
settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training
iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable
training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low
test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with
large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work
proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch
training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of
large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same
number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training
technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch
training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.

<details>

Motivation: 解决真实临床数据隐私限制、罕见病数据稀缺及观察数据偏见问题。

Method: DualAlign框架结合统计对齐（基于患者人口统计和风险因素）和语义对齐（基于真实症状轨迹）。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病案例中，DualAlign生成的合成数据显著提升LLaMA模型性能。

Conclusion: DualAlign为生成隐私保护、临床相关的合成数据提供实用方法，支持低资源临床文本分析。

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

TL;DR: GTS Forecaster是一个开源Python包，用于处理非线性、非平稳的地球测量时间序列预测，结合了先进的深度学习模型和预处理工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球测量时间序列（如GNSS、SSH和TG）的预测对灾害预警和缓解至关重要，但传统模型难以处理其复杂动态。

Method: 集成了KAN、GNNGRU和TimeGNN等深度学习模型，并提供KTIF等预处理工具。

Result: 支持GNSS、SSH和TG数据集的预测、可视化和评估，适用于一般时间序列应用。

Conclusion: GTS Forecaster通过先进模型和易用接口，推动了深度学习在地球测量预测中的应用。

Abstract: Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge
(TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level
change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems
and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge,
and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete
nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models,
which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal
dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for
geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models
-- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated
recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to
effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also
provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a
reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion
Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting,
visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable
to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an
accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in
geodetic forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: pySigLib是一个高性能Python库，优化了签名和签名核的实现，支持CPU和GPU，并与PyTorch自动微分兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有签名核方法在大规模数据集和长序列上性能不足。

Method: 开发了pySigLib库，提供优化的签名和签名核实现，并引入新的签名核微分方案。

Result: pySigLib显著提升了计算效率，并提供了准确的梯度计算。

Conclusion: pySigLib为大规模签名计算提供了高效解决方案，适用于时间序列生成模型。

Abstract: Signature-based methods have recently gained significant traction in machine
learning for sequential data. In particular, signature kernels have emerged as
powerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on
time-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations
do not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice.
We present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised
implementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully
compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient
software stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a
novel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate
gradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.

*Georgiy A. Bondar,Abhishek Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种寻找最优多边际薛定谔桥（MSB）的方法，通过最小生成树问题解决所有可能图结构的最优耦合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在已知统计量和相关结构的随机向量集合中找到最优耦合，并探索最优图结构。

Method: 分两步解决：1）构建完全图，边权重为双边际SB最优值与端点熵之和；2）在加权完全图上求解最小生成树问题。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 最优MSB问题可通过最小生成树问题解决，方法高效且实用。

Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among
a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation
structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified
\emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices.
In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in
the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We
find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning
tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem
can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with
edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal
SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard
minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical
experiments illustrate the proposed solution.

*Federico J. Gonzalez,Luis P. Lara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合微分方程结构和神经网络灵活性的数据驱动框架，通过特征曲线（CCs）实现非线性系统辨识，平衡了可解释性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性系统辨识中可解释性与灵活性之间的权衡问题，同时引入物理约束。

Method: 提出基于特征曲线（CCs）的框架，包括三种策略：SINDy-CC（稀疏回归）、Poly-CC（多项式）和NN-CC（神经网络）。

Result: NN-CC在复杂非线性和不连续系统中表现优异，而所有方法均适用于简单多项式非线性系统。

Conclusion: CC框架（尤其是NN-CC）能在保持可解释性的同时捕捉复杂非线性，为系统辨识提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off
between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of
physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines
the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the
flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the
concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear
functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is
modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation
of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based
formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which
extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the
mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,
which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which
uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results
show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple
polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,
NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex
nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip
systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based
framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities
while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the
CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with
discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using
traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool
for nonlinear system identification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习的GestaltMatcher服务，用于面部畸形诊断，保护患者隐私的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GestaltMatcher依赖集中式数据集，但患者数据分散且受隐私法规限制，阻碍发展。

Method: 采用跨机构水平联邦学习框架，医院协作训练全局特征提取器，不共享图像，通过隐私保护核矩阵计算进行推断。

Result: 联邦服务保留了90%以上的集中式性能，对机构数量和数据分布差异具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 联邦GestaltMatcher在保护隐私的同时，实现了高效的协作诊断和发现。

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

*Nikita Rajaneesh,Thomas Zollo,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时预热方法，通过弱监督辅助任务数据适应多模态大语言模型（MLLM），显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM在文本和图像交叉领域的推理潜力尚未完全发挥，主要因训练数据不足导致性能较弱。

Method: 采用测试时预热方法，利用弱监督辅助任务数据对MLLM进行适应性调整。

Result: 在MMMU、VQA-Rad和GQA任务上分别实现了4.03%、5.28%和1.63%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 测试前预热能有效增强MLLM在多样化推理任务中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced
reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully
realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,
and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text
embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with
billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only
thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on
complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on
extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup
method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly
supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative
performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on
the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up'
before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用自监督目标达成技术使多智能体协作，通过最大化访问特定目标的可能性而非标量奖励，简化任务设定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计奖励函数以促使智能体协作和长期推理具有挑战性，本文旨在通过自监督目标达成技术解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自监督目标达成技术，智能体通过最大化访问目标状态的可能性来学习协作，而非依赖复杂奖励函数。

Result: 在MARL基准测试中，该方法优于其他依赖相同稀疏奖励信号的方法，并展现出涌现的合作和探索行为。

Conclusion: 自监督多智能体目标达成技术能有效促进协作和探索，尤其在稀疏反馈环境下表现优异。

Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative
approaches never witness a single successful trial.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M4GN是一种三层次的分段中心层次网络，通过混合分割策略和模态分解特征优化，解决了层次GNN在粗粒度图构建和细粒度精度保持上的挑战，显著提升了预测精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决层次GNN在大型、长程网格上构建粗粒度图时保持拓扑、几何和物理不连续性，以及在不牺牲速度的情况下保持细粒度精度的挑战。

Method: 采用混合分割策略（快速图分割器和超像素式细化）生成动态一致的节点段，通过置换不变聚合器编码，结合微观GNN和宏观Transformer实现高效推理。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，M4GN将预测精度提升高达56%，推理速度提升高达22%。

Conclusion: M4GN通过层次化设计和混合分割策略，在精度和效率之间取得了平衡，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for
PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and
over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten
propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs
that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii)
maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from
coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric
hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that
pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by
modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically
consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant
aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation
approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level
GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons
efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy
and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN
improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster
inference than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的方法，用于单正多标签学习（SPMLL），利用共形预测生成校准的集合值输出，无需依赖标签分布假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中，收集完整标签注释成本高且耗时，许多数据集中每个训练实例仅标注一个正标签，但实际存在多个相关标签。

Method: 采用共形预测方法，生成校准的集合值输出，填补单标签训练与多标签评估之间的监督差距。

Result: 在12个基准数据集上评估，方法表现优于现有基线，具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法在极端部分监督下实现了可靠的多标签预测，无需依赖标签分布假设。

Abstract: Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for
training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and
labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated
per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This
setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a
significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We
propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction
to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label
predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between
single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label
distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical
applicability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在首价拍卖中，投标策略需要平衡赢标概率和利润，传统方法难以动态适应不同上下文。

Method: 将投标策略建模为测度值凸优化问题，使用正则化的Wasserstein-proximal更新参数分布。

Result: 证明了优化问题有闭式解，并通过数值示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能动态优化投标策略，提升预期利润。

Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a
measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for
bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint
distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter
distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a
data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the
context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,
device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to
place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win
probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting
measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A
numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

Conclusion: Scalify提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法来检测和定位静默错误，为调试提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Modern machine learning frameworks support very large models by incorporating
parallelism and optimization techniques. Yet, these very techniques add new
layers of complexity, introducing silent errors that severely degrade model
performance. Existing solutions are either ad hoc or too costly for production.
  We present Scalify, a lightweight framework that exposes silent errors by
verifying semantic equivalence of computational graphs using equality
saturation and Datalog-style reasoning. To scale, Scalify partitions graphs
with parallel rewriting and layer memoization, reuses rewrite templates, and
augments equality saturation with relational reasoning and symbolic bijection
inference. It further localizes discrepancies to precise code sites, turning
verification results into actionable debugging guidance. Scalify verifies
models as large as Llama-3.1-405B within minutes on a commodity machine and
exposed five unknown bugs in Amazon production machine learning frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架的顺序微调方法，通过量化不确定性实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决顺序学习中数据量少、分布变化及延迟敏感环境下的训练稳定性问题。

Method: 将顺序微调建模为后验推断问题，结合矩传播、卡尔曼贝叶斯神经网络和泰勒近似。

Result: 在分布变化和内存受限的任务中，方法表现出鲁棒性和数据高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过平衡先验知识与新信息，实现了高效的顺序学习。

Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive
sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning,
sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount
of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the
pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to
be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally
quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we
propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior
inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates
closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural
Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By
explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing
them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method
achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential
adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution
shifts and limited memory resources.

Result: 在Crunchbase数据上，CrunchLLM的预测准确率超过80%，优于传统分类器和基线LLM。

Conclusion: CrunchLLM展示了领域适应LLM在创业结果预测中的潜力，为风投和创新政策提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

Motivation: 解决传感器数据流中多模态信息融合的挑战，尤其是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Method: 从Ego4D数据集中选取多样化活动数据，利用LLM进行零样本和少样本分类，无需任务特定训练。

Result: LLM在12类活动分类中F1分数显著高于随机，且无需额外内存和计算资源。

Conclusion: LLM融合方法适用于多模态时序应用，尤其在训练数据有限时表现出色。

Abstract: Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and
context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary
information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can
be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time
series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition
across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset.
Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores
significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot
classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable
multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data
for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can
enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for
targeted application-specific multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在整体治疗效果较小的情况下，需要针对高治疗效果区域进行干预。

Method: 将目标区域识别视为分类问题，提出主动学习框架。

Result: 降低了实验成本，确保覆盖所有高治疗效果区域。

Conclusion: 理论和实验验证了该方法的效率和优势。

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing
participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations,
the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus
naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions
where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair
experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high
treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the
target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning
framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only
reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures
that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.
Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with
experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages
of the approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理和问答方面表现出色，但常产生不准确或不可靠的内容（幻觉），限制了其在高风险应用中的部署。

Result: HalluField在模型和数据集上实现了最先进的幻觉检测性能，且计算高效，无需微调或辅助神经网络。

Conclusion: 通过物理视角建模LLM行为，HalluField提供了一种高效且理论基础的幻觉检测方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and
question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or
unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly
limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing
need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this
work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for
hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and
thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response
to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood
token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By
analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under
changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic
stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying
unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is
computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the
model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural
networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical
interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.
Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField
achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and
datasets.

Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus
food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of
maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing
algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities,
leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by
proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates
context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of
decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate
higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating
geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically
fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor
approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis
algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both
synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm
achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.

TL;DR: GoldenTransformer是一个模块化、可扩展的故障注入框架，用于评估大型语言模型在硬件故障下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在多个领域广泛应用，但其在故障条件下的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: GoldenTransformer基于PyTorch和HuggingFace Transformers，支持多种故障注入（如权重损坏、激活注入等），并关注Transformer架构的独特挑战。

Result: 通过分类和生成任务的实验，展示了GoldenTransformer在模型鲁棒性分析中的实用性。

Conclusion: GoldenTransformer为研究人员和从业者提供了分析模型鲁棒性和指导实际LLM应用系统设计的工具。

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of
state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision,
and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the
robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We
present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework
designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced
hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for
injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation
injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained
transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our
framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer
architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent
dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop
PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment
reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail
the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through
several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling
controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a
transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable
tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in
real-world LLM applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的新去偏方法，通过关注编码器权重而非传统解码器权重，实现了更高的公平性和性能保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SAE的去偏方法假设特征表示存在于解码器权重中，但作者挑战这一假设，提出编码器权重同样重要。

Method: 提出S&P TopK框架，包括非传统特征选择策略、正交化输入嵌入的新去偏方法，以及编码器权重插值以保持性能。

Result: S&P TopK在公平性指标上比传统SAE方法提升3.2倍，在VLM去偏任务中提升1.8倍，同时保持下游性能。

Conclusion: 编码器权重的关注和正交化方法是去偏的有效策略，S&P TopK框架显著提升了公平性和性能。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to
provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods
based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature
representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this
fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for
representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an
unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE
debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder
weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during
debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection
framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness
metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM
debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream
performance.

Motivation: 解决训练因素组合对性能和稳定性的敏感性问题，提供可靠配置选择方法。

Method: 结合主效应和双因素交互作用估计，通过插件路径和最小二乘路径实现Shapley贡献重构，标准化估计并量化不确定性。

Result: 提升排名保持和最优配置识别，降低决策风险，提供可解释的性能增益。

Conclusion: FACTORS在预算约束下提供稳定性能增益和可解释的配置选择依据。

Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with
Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are
sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently
estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a
risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and
cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget.
Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in
path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs
Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work
complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By
incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty
quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor
spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations
within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we
provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on
optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and
interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe
improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our
approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification,
reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers
interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under
budget constraints.

Conclusion: CogGNN为认知基础的脑网络建模奠定了坚实基础，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative learning has advanced network neuroscience, enabling tasks like
graph super-resolution, temporal graph prediction, and multimodal brain graph
fusion. However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive
traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model,
CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to
generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly
applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual
input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory
recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain
templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks.
Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs
that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are:
(i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss;
(ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield
well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive
experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing
a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.

Method: 整合局部-全局Transformer编码器、记忆引导重建机制和多尺度表示匹配策略，协同增强模型能力。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上优于现有方法，提供了更鲁棒的异常评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为图异常检测提供了全面且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging
problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the
majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing
methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often
suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to
become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches
are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction
process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a
novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key
components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction
mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components
work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and
global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and
assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are
computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals,
resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly
detection across various graph domains.

Conclusion: 简化模型结构和合理选择描述符可高效提升预测性能，适用于高通量筛选。

Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过对抗性目标函数解决扩散去噪平滑中的协变量偏移问题，显著提高了认证准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，扩散去噪平滑虽然表现优异，但会因噪声估计错误引入协变量偏移，影响分类器性能。

Method: 提出一种针对扩散去噪模型噪声的对抗性目标函数，训练基分类器以抵抗协变量偏移。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet三个基准数据集上显著提高了认证准确性，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了扩散去噪平滑中的协变量偏移问题，提升了分类器的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly
available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过欺骗机制实现分布外泛化的方法，称为欺骗风险最小化（DRM），通过学习使训练数据对观察者呈现独立同分布的特征表示，从而识别稳定特征并泛化到未见领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如域适应或不变表示学习需要测试数据或训练数据的域划分，而DRM无需这些条件，旨在消除虚假相关性并实现更广泛的泛化。

Method: DRM通过可微分目标同时学习消除分布偏移的特征（基于共形鞅的检测器）并最小化任务特定损失。

Result: 实验表明，DRM在概念偏移和协变量偏移的模拟环境中有效。

Conclusion: DRM是一种无需测试数据或域划分的泛化方法，适用于多种分布偏移场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear
independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify
stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen
domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and
instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously
learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a
detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss.
In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning
methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training
data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the
efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated
imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is
deployed in.

TL;DR: ToMA是一种高效GPU对齐的令牌合并方法，通过子模优化和矩阵操作，显著降低扩散模型生成延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但受限于Transformer的二次注意力复杂度，现有令牌合并方法因GPU效率低下而无法实现理论加速。

Method: 提出ToMA，将令牌合并重新设计为子模优化问题，利用GPU友好的矩阵操作实现合并/解合并，并利用局部性和冗余性最小化开销。

Result: ToMA在SDXL/Flux上分别减少24%/23%的生成延迟，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToMA填补了扩散模型中Transformer理论效率与实际效率之间的差距。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability
limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token
reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens
in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting,
scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when
paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To
bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf
method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three
key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular
optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an
attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3)
exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to
minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%,
respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This
work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for
transformers in diffusion.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型的“黑箱”问题，促进高信任领域的应用。

Method: 通过MNIST数字分类和IMDB情感分析任务，对比两种概念的定义、目标和方法。

Result: 可解释性侧重于全局理解，而可解释性侧重于局部解释，两者互补但不可替代。

Conclusion: 明确区分可解释性和可解释性对发展可靠人工智能至关重要。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced
by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which
impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the
intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively
falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of
research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry
distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of
interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,
carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent
methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of
the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we
substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's
inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global
understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with
post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual
predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution
methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and
word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these
local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent.
A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard
datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 随着“AI精神病”案例的增加，研究旨在量化LLM对心理健康的潜在危害，并呼吁改进模型训练。

Method: 通过psychosis-bench基准测试，评估了8种LLM在16种模拟妄想场景中的表现，包括妄想确认、危害促成和安全干预。

Result: 所有LLM均表现出心理致病潜力，尤其在隐性场景中更易确认妄想和促成危害，安全干预率低。

Conclusion: 研究强调LLM心理致病风险需引起重视，呼吁跨领域合作改进模型安全性，将其视为公共卫生问题。

Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where
user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse
psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can
beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs
in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured,
12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional
themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions)
and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion
Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across
explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated
psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than
challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled
harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety
interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37
$\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.
Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more
likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions
(p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).
Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent
property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk
and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame
this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health
imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and
healthcare professionals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从现有全秩模型或第三方检查点提取适配器的需求，避免显式训练每个适配器。

Method: 通过计算基础模型与其微调版本之间的权重差异的低秩分解，重构适配器模块。

Result: 提取的适配器保留了高能量，可安全修剪，重新合并时下游任务性能几乎无下降。

Conclusion: PHLoRA为现有全秩检查点提供适配器支持，推动了高效推理的普及。

Abstract: We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet
powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank
fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By
computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model
and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that
can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in
scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach
amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings.
Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples
fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing
full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and
video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted
adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely,
and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.
Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank
checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了如何通过解耦表示空间搜索和参数空间学习，克服梯度下降的探索局限性。

Abstract: Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss
without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better.
Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is
generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs
training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space
(the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational
solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to
those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover
representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with
compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied
solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by
regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to
saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained
with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during
training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome
gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in
representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires
are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives
globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses
would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though
recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management
techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after
ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires
extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the
California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million
data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby
potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they
spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012
to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of
leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone
conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and
early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation
data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already
demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial
intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000
acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to
enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent
for future wildfire databases in other regions.

TL;DR: FragmentGPT是一个统一框架，用于解决片段药物发现中的连接和冗余问题，通过化学感知预训练和RAE算法优化多目标分子生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 片段药物发现中设计有效连接器和处理结构冗余（如重复环）是挑战，现有方法无法简单解决。

Method: 结合化学感知预训练策略和RAE算法，增强GPT模型的片段连接、合并能力，并优化多目标分子生成。

Result: 实验证明FragmentGPT能生成化学有效、高质量分子，适用于下游药物发现任务。

Conclusion: FragmentGPT提供了一种可控、目标驱动的分子组装方法，解决了片段药物发现中的关键问题。

Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug
development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular
fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains
challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural
redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding
or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework,
we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel
chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips
the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities,
and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm
that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data
selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective
goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that
connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple
pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as
duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of
optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular
assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets
demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules
tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

Motivation: 深度学习扩散模型在天气预测中表现优异，但自回归计算成本高，数据有限且昂贵，因此探索高效数据选择方法。

Method: 评估多种数据采样策略，重点研究时间分层采样方法。

Result: 时间分层采样方法在部分指标上优于全数据训练，其他指标略差，但仅需20%数据。

Conclusion: 证明了数据高效扩散训练的可行性，并启发未来研究自适应或模型感知采样方法。

Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量标记数据稀缺，传统方法在轴承故障诊断中表现不佳，现有方法在数据多样性和全局特征提取方面存在局限。

Method: 提出CCLR-GAN生成多样化数据，使用对比学习优化训练数据关系，并设计1D-FCNN提取全局特征。

Result: 在CWRU数据集上性能提升32%，在自建测试台上提升10%。

Conclusion: DAC-FCF为数据稀缺下的轴承故障诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been
widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,
high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot
learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still
face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation
techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples
that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover,
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields
makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration
signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate
relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we
propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution
framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a
novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction
generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse
data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is
utilized to better model the relations between the available training data.
Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to
achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF
achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on
case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected
test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the
proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for
bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.

Abstract: DemandLens demonstrates an innovative Prophet based forecasting model for the

E-commerce players in the recent years, wherein the business model majorly
relies on outsourcing Mattress manufacturing and related logistics and supply
chain operations, focusing on marketing the product and driving conversions
through Direct-to-Consumer sales channels. Now, within the United States, there
are a limited number of Mattress contract manufacturers available, and hence,
it is important that they manage their raw materials, supply chain, and,
inventory intelligently, to be able to cater maximum Mattress brands. Our
approach addresses the critical need for accurate Sales Forecasting in an
industry that is heavily dependent on third-party Contract Manufacturing. This,
in turn, helps the contract manufacturers to be prepared, hence, avoiding

The model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities through SKU-specific
Hyperparameter optimization, offering the Contract Manufacturers and Mattress
brands a reliable tool to streamline supply chain operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏数据和不完整路径上表现不佳，且缺乏对复杂空间依赖的建模。

Method: 使用六边形网格将原始数据转换为高阶流动表示，并集成GCN建模空间关系。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于基线模型，准确率和F1分数提升1-8%。

Conclusion: 结合图学习和序列建模，为TUL提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with
the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized
recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based
services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and
limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level
check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced
GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order
mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data
sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and
continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations,
mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer
explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies
without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest.
Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over
classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method
in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative
gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with
a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs
enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data.
This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with
sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with
applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

Motivation: 现有大型基础模型主要关注文本和视觉数据，忽略了BIM模型中的语义、空间和拓扑特征，因此需要开发专门的方法来学习和重用这些特征。

Method: 引入可扩展的图表示编码BIM组件的特征，构建大规模数据集，提出BIGNet并采用新的消息传递机制和节点掩码策略进行预训练。

Result: BIGNet在BIM设计检查任务中表现优异，特别是基于GAT的特征提取方法，平均F1分数比未预训练模型提高了72.7%。

Conclusion: BIGNet能有效学习和迁移BIM设计特征，为未来设计和生命周期管理的自动化应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in
civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data,
overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM
(Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the
first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse
multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable
graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological"
features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5
million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new
message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node
masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning
tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph
representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2)
considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance,
and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction
achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7%
improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its
effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating
their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.

Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,
while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these
limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username
for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated
into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset,
Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on
Github.

Motivation: 现有方法多关注保留输入特征拓扑，而调整特征空间拓扑在机器学习中具有潜在优势，如降维、生成建模等。

Method: 引入Hopkins loss，通过Hopkins统计量强制实现目标特征空间拓扑。

Result: 在语音、文本和图像数据上的实验表明，Hopkins loss对分类性能影响小，同时能有效调整特征拓扑。

Conclusion: Hopkins loss是一种有效的工具，可在不显著影响性能的情况下调整特征空间拓扑。

Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the
feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning
applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer
learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel
loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a
desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing
topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in
two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear
bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss
into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on
classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature
topology.

Motivation: 解决注意力机制二次复杂度问题，提升LLM在长上下文中的扩展性。

Method: 通过SVD计算通用投影矩阵，动态选择稀疏维度。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B上实现25%计算减少，性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: AQUA为大规模LLM推理提供了高效且可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Conclusion: MetaDFME通过元学习有效减少分布偏移，提升了无数据模型提取的实用性和稳定性。

Abstract: Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems,
especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate
the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data.
Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer
from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which
could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution
during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute
model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution
data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method
that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution
shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In
detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations
of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be
adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model
to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution
shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current
state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more
stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification is a significant challenge in machine learning,
especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection,
and cybersecurity. Traditional oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, often
fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced
classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose GK-SMOTE, a
hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient extension of SMOTE, built on Gaussian
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). GK-SMOTE enhances class separability by
generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions, while
effectively avoiding noisy or ambiguous areas. This self-adaptive approach uses
Gaussian KDE to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, ensuring more
accurate sample generation without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Our
extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets demonstrate
that GK-SMOTE outperforms existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques
across key evaluation metrics, including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC. The
proposed method offers a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced
classification tasks, especially in noisy data environments, making it an
attractive choice for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 方法通过曲率分析揭示了简单线性合并的有效性，并开源了代码和检查点以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing
capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this
in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT
checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general
instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a
single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a
curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics
as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate
interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a
curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or
low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in
early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared
curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of
the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based
SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space
baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity
levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints,
offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in
practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference
and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full
formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training
and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT
checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.

Result: 在联邦学习环境中，FedGDVE性能提升高达34.86%。

Conclusion: FedGDVE有效解决了全局数据整合的挑战，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy
concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online
store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model
updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby
preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing
FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,
despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to
enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this
end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform
collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender
system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item
lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or
locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of
sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional
challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and
irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational
costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively
augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the
global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract
global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess
client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability
estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.
FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL
environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了四种新的ODT问题定义，并基于代数编程理论推导出动态规划算法，为一般ODT问题提供了统一高效的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ODT问题的形式化定义和高效算法，以支持更灵活的决策树构建。

Method: 通过可执行的递归程序定义问题，并利用代数编程理论推导动态规划算法。

Result: 提出了四种新的最优算法，涵盖已知的深度约束算法，并展示了其高效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建灵活决策树提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel
definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for
depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through
executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal
specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the
study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving
correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only
establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but
also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four
generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT
problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective
functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known
depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while
providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT
problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm
and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree
algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The
results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible
splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support
algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those
with mixed splitting rules.

*Emil Malmsten,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransZero是一种基于模型的强化学习算法，通过并行生成潜在未来状态加速蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），相比MuZero实现11倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MCTS中顺序搜索的瓶颈问题，提升实时决策效率。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的网络同时生成多个潜在未来状态，结合MVC评估器消除对顺序访问计数的依赖。

Result: 在MiniGrid和LunarLander实验中，TransZero比MuZero快11倍且保持样本效率。

Conclusion: 并行树构建显著加速基于模型的强化学习，推动复杂环境中的实时决策应用。

Abstract: We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that
removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike
MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent
dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate
multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance
Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential
visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire
subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that
TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to
MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that
parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based
reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex
environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了Hadamard流形上的在线黎曼优化，利用horospherical凸性（h-凸性）框架，克服了传统geodesic凸性（g-凸性）导致的遗憾界对曲率依赖性强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖g-凸性，导致遗憾界与流形曲率强相关，性能受限。本文旨在通过h-凸性框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出黎曼在线梯度下降法，分析h-凸和强h-凸函数的性能，分别得到$O(\sqrt{T})$和$O(\log(T))$的遗憾界。

Result: 实验验证了方法在对称正定矩阵流形上的有效性，展示了h-凸性在Tyler's $M$-估计和Fr\'echet均值计算中的应用。

Conclusion: h-凸性框架提供了曲率无关的遗憾界，性能与欧几里得空间一致，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds under the
framework of horospherical convexity (h-convexity). Prior work mostly relies on
the geodesic convexity (g-convexity), leading to regret bounds scaling poorly
with the manifold curvature. To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian
online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\log(T))$ regret guarantees, respectively. These
bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean
setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In
particular, we investigate online Tyler's $M$-estimation and online Fr\'echet
mean computation, showing the application of h-convexity in practice.

TL;DR: TabPFN RL是一种无需梯度的深度强化学习框架，利用预训练Transformer TabPFN作为Q函数近似器，避免了梯度更新的计算成本和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的深度强化学习对超参数敏感、训练不稳定且计算成本高，TabPFN RL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过TabPFN的上下文学习能力预测Q值，无需反向传播或任务微调，并设计高奖励轨迹筛选机制。

Result: 在Gymnasium经典控制任务中，TabPFN RL表现优于或匹配Deep Q Network，且无需梯度下降或超参数调优。

Conclusion: TabPFN RL为梯度无关的强化学习提供了高效新方向，展示了预训练Transformer在RL中的潜力。

Abstract: Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to
hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We
propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the
meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally
developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on
millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via
in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new
unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass,
without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict
Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back
propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed
context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top
5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control
suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on
CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent
or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of
how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate
the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a
surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context
size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation
strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results
establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast
and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL
with large pre trained transformers.

*Qiuhao Liu,Ling Li,Yao Lu,Qi Xuan,Zhaowei Zhu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SelectMix是一种针对噪声标签的置信度引导混合框架，通过选择性混合不确定样本与置信样本，提升模型在噪声标签下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易记忆噪声标签，导致泛化性能下降。现有基于Mixup的方法缺乏样本选择和混合策略的指导，可能传播噪声监督。

Method: SelectMix通过K折交叉验证识别噪声或模糊样本，并选择性地将其与置信样本混合，使用软标签确保监督信号与实际输入对齐。

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上，SelectMix均优于基线方法，验证了其在噪声标签学习中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SelectMix通过置信度引导的混合策略，显著提升了模型在噪声标签下的性能，为噪声标签学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: PINGS是一种基于物理信息的神经网络框架，用于快速生成采样，通过单次前向传递实现高效采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散采样方法计算成本高，PINGS旨在通过物理信息网络近似反向时间概率流动力学，减少采样时间。

Method: 训练物理信息网络近似反向时间概率流动力学，实现单次前向传递采样（NFE = 1）。

Result: PINGS在保持目标分布结构的同时，实现了恒定时间生成（10^4样本仅需16.54毫秒），优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PINGS为快速、基于函数的生成采样提供了有前景的解决方案，并可能扩展到科学模拟领域。

Abstract: We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative
Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a
physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics,
reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we
learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure
(multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in
mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time
generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090,
versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM
(50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the
PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator,
obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative
ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS
frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint
anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These
proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast,
function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific
simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).

TL;DR: CIFNet是一种高效且可持续的类增量学习方法，通过预训练冻结特征提取器和压缩数据缓冲区，显著减少计算开销和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中灾难性遗忘和资源消耗大的问题，特别是在资源有限的环境中。

Method: 结合预训练冻结特征提取器、压缩数据缓冲区和高效的非迭代单层神经网络分类器，实现单步优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，准确率与现有先进方法相当，同时大幅提升训练效率和可持续性。

Conclusion: CIFNet显著提升了类增量学习在资源有限环境中的实用性和可访问性。

Abstract: Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as
models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose
previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges
are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class
Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually
adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial
computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work
introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach
that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable
solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several
existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature
extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer
neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor
eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,
combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to
perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization
process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time
without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets
confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the
classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing
state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and
sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making
class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with
limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are
available.

TL;DR: Opal提出了一种基于操作符视角的RLHF方法，通过加性惩罚和乘性权重表达目标，并引入GKPO作为通用表示框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为RLHF方法提供一个统一的表示和转换框架，解决现有方法在假设不成立时的不可约简性问题。

Method: 使用加性惩罚和乘性权重构建目标梯子，提出GKPO作为通用表示框架，支持JSON序列化和规范化。

Result: 展示了GKPO在DPO、RRHF和ORPO中的应用，并通过压力测试验证了非约简性情况。

Conclusion: GKPO为RLHF方法提供了标准化表示和转换工具，适用于多种场景，但需注意假设条件是否满足。

Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs
in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated
strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the
capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials
characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently
validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal
benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization
techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We
employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to
construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice
and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most
advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao
Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective
questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating
strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

Motivation: 研究对抗训练算法在分布式环境中的表现，尤其是模型平坦度对鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架，分析算法逃离局部极小值的效率，并通过模拟实验验证。

Result: 扰动较小时，分散式算法（如共识和扩散）比集中式策略更快逃离局部极小值，但随着扰动增加，趋势可能逆转。

Conclusion: 分散式策略在分布式环境中具有提升模型鲁棒性的潜力。

Abstract: Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role
in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses
on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including
centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning
environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model
flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general
theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from
local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.
We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the
attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,
decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and
diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the
centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the
perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation
results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the
performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized
adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of
decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed
settings.

Result: 模型在orthohantavirus、rotavirus A和rabies lyssavirus上的预测准确率分别为89.62%、96.58%和77.22%。

Conclusion: BiLSTM-VHP模型在病毒宿主预测中表现优异，提供的数据集和代码有助于进一步研究。

Abstract: Recorded history shows the long coexistence of humans and animals, suggesting
it began much earlier. Despite some beneficial interdependence, many animals
carry viral diseases that can spread to humans. These diseases are known as
zoonotic diseases. Recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox and swine flu
viruses have shown how these viruses can disrupt human life and cause death.
Fast and accurate predictions of the host from which the virus spreads can help
prevent these diseases from spreading. This work presents BiLSTM-VHP, a
lightweight bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture that
can predict the host from the nucleotide sequence of orthohantavirus, rabies
lyssavirus, and rotavirus A with high accuracy. The proposed model works with
nucleotide sequences of 400 bases in length and achieved a prediction accuracy
of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies
lyssavirus outperforming previous studies. Moreover, performance of the model
is assessed using the confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall,
microaverage AUC. In addition, we introduce three curated datasets of
orthohantavirus, rotavirus A, and rabies lyssavirus containing 8,575, 95,197,
and 22,052 nucleotide sequences divided into 9, 12, and 29 host classes,

Method: 分析了密集和稀疏门控机制，提出匹配算法对齐独立训练的MoE模型，验证LMC的存在。

Result: 实验证实MoE架构中存在LMC，揭示了深度学习模型的功能景观和优化动态。

Conclusion: MoE架构中的LMC现象为深度学习模型的优化和功能理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes
of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to
be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space
along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges
classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model
ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry.
Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we
systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational
efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as
experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating
that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by
permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function.
Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that
enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the
discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using
our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense,
sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and
datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of
LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional
landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.

Conclusion: 该方法在动态环境中有效，且可扩展到子序列场景。

Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of online omniprediction with long-term
constraints. At each round, a forecaster is tasked with generating predictions
for an underlying (adaptively, adversarially chosen) state that are broadcast
to a collection of downstream agents, who must each choose an action. Each of
the downstream agents has both a utility function mapping actions and state to
utilities, and a vector-valued constraint function mapping actions and states
to vector-valued costs. The utility and constraint functions can arbitrarily
differ across downstream agents. Their goal is to choose actions that guarantee
themselves no regret while simultaneously guaranteeing that they do not
cumulatively violate the constraints across time. We show how to make a single
set of predictions so that each of the downstream agents can guarantee this by
acting as a simple function of the predictions, guaranteeing each of them
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(1)$ cumulative constraint violation. We
also show how to extend our guarantees to arbitrary intersecting contextually
defined \emph{subsequences}, guaranteeing each agent both regret and constraint
violation bounds not just marginally, but simultaneously on each subsequence,
against a benchmark set of actions simultaneously tailored to each subsequence.

Motivation: 现有资源缺乏结合行为描述与其他模态的数据集，阻碍了全面分析人类行为特征的研究。

Method: 提出了PersonaX数据集，包含CelebPersona和AthlePersona两部分，并引入因果表示学习框架（CRL）进行分析。

Result: 实验证明CRL框架在多模态数据分析中有效，PersonaX为行为特征研究提供了基础。

Conclusion: PersonaX推动了多模态特征分析和因果推理的研究，为个性化AI系统等应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 现实应用中环境动态可能变化，导致模型漂移，需要有效检测方法。

Method: 通过分析代理行为序列的分布变化，引入编辑操作度量来量化轨迹偏差。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效区分漂移与非漂移场景，适应不同噪声水平。

Conclusion: 该框架为检测非平稳RL环境中的漂移提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment
dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and
finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to
model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by
analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior.
Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify
deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and
perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can
effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying
levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in
non-stationary RL environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven music
generation has become a vibrant and fruitful area of research. However, the
representation of musical data remains a significant challenge. To address
this, a novel, machine-learning-friendly music notation system, YNote, was
developed. This study leverages YNote to train an effective classification
model capable of distinguishing whether a piece of music was composed by a
human (Native), a rule-based algorithm (Algorithm Generated), or an LLM (LLM
Generated). We frame this as a text classification problem, applying the Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to extract structural
features from YNote sequences and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. The resulting model achieves an
accuracy of 98.25%, successfully demonstrating that YNote retains sufficient
stylistic information for analysis. More importantly, the model can identify
the unique " technological fingerprints " left by different AI generation
techniques, providing a powerful tool for tracing the origins of AI-generated
content.

real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework
combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受监管环境中，黑盒模型缺乏透明度，无法满足监管要求（如IRB模型），因此需要一种既能保持预测性能又透明的解决方案。

Method: 使用SHAP进行特征选择，XGBoost作为基准黑盒模型，EBM和PLTR作为透明模型，结合特征交互分析和专家输入优化模型。

Result: 在Lending Club数据集上，该方法仅使用10个特征（减少88.5%），性能与黑盒模型相当。

Conclusion: 混合方法在保持预测性能的同时提高了透明度和可解释性，适用于受监管的信用评分领域。

Abstract: Predicting default is essential for banks to ensure profitability and
financial stability. While modern machine learning methods often outperform
traditional regression techniques, their lack of transparency limits their use
in regulated environments. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
emerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI
research focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not
produce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory
requirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.
  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box
models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that
maintain both predictive power and transparency.
  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves
performance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10
features - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
serves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting
Machine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the
investigated glass-box models.
  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis,
correlation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability
and robustness.

Conclusion: AI与网络红队的融合能提升安全评估效果，促进工具成熟和可扩展性。

Abstract: A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective
strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more
enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the
unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that
AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized
as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue
that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better
evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has
new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that
re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a
cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a
well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual
accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature
the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the
merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and
best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.

Conclusion: FlexBench旨在帮助从业者根据可用资源、需求和约束做出经济高效的AI部署决策。

Abstract: Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with
the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed
deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest
that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are
continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and
hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy
consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a
modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with
HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights.
Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset,
which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive
modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench
concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek
R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable
practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their
available resources, requirements, and constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用方法，用于分析广义单指数模型中非凸梯度下降的长期轨迹行为，揭示了梯度下降的隐式正则化效应，并展示了两种应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非凸梯度下降在广义单指数模型中的长期行为，特别是在大纵横比区域下的动态特性。

Method: 通过状态演化系统跟踪确定性向量（高斯理论梯度下降）的动态，并证明梯度下降迭代的集中性和独立性。

Result: 梯度下降迭代在大纵横比区域下表现出数据无关性和特征向量的强不相干性，验证了隐式正则化效应。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅揭示了梯度下降的动态行为，还提供了实用的低计算成本工具，如超参数调优和运行时确定。

Abstract: This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time
trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index
models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each
iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic
vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can
be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two
scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of
design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic
convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient
descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and
strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as
the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models
under Gaussian data.
  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two
applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we
prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent
initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish
universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for
large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm
for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent
trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for
practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio
regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line
of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time
horizon.

Abstract: This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash
severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from
Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301
EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using
XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful
event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors,
along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To
address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited
Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art
deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for
severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization,
MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases
due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the
potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction
and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.

Conclusion: 动态奖励权重方法在多目标强化学习中优于固定权重方法，适用于复杂非凸目标空间。

Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for
identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled
the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs;
however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease
similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised
deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link
prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data.
Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of
omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs
were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph
neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction
accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of
0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link
probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new
drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing
the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.

Motivation: 解决DNN在关键应用中因过度自信导致的早期退出不可信问题。

Method: 使用选择性预测和延迟分类器检测样本难度，避免过早退出。

Result: 错误预测风险减少50%，速度提升2.05倍。

Conclusion: SPEED方法显著提升DNN的准确性和效率，适用于关键应用。

Abstract: Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the
bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks.
Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit
from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the
predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which
can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy.
We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the
`hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score
alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs)
at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs.
Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an
intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early
detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational
resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We
demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our
method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of
$2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer. The anonymized source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受对抗样本攻击，传统对抗训练(AT)在提升鲁棒性的同时会降低自然数据的性能。研究发现大型模型比小型模型更具鲁棒性，因此探索如何将这种鲁棒性系统性地蒸馏到小型模型中。

Method: 提出DARD方法，通过定制的知识蒸馏范式传递鲁棒性；同时提出DPGD方法，优化对抗样本生成以增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，DARD方法在相同架构下优于传统对抗训练网络，实现了更高的鲁棒性和标准准确性。

Conclusion: DARD方法有效解决了对抗训练中的性能与鲁棒性权衡问题，为小型模型的鲁棒性提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing critical
security challenges in real-world applications. While Adversarial Training (AT
) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs
a trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent
efforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over
their smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such
robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models into
compact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer
robustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm. Additionally, we
propose Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD), an adversarial example
generalization method optimized for effective attack. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that the DARD approach consistently outperforms adversarially
trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and
standard accuracy.

Result: 在四个动态基准测试中，7B模型达到SOTA性能，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 半在线RL有效弥合了离线训练效率与在线多步推理之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress
in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement
learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL
enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with
multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online
RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from
sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present
Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL
on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original
model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively
recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture
long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns
into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level
and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance
(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a
practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that
ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four
dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on
AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging
the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

Abstract: Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network
security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown
considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex
temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are
adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables.
However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both
characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often
overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies
may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off,
we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture.
DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic
cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A
learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the
input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a
hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the
common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher
accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural
design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning
DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.

Abstract: Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well
known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance.
However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is
hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this
paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY
homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically,
it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure
optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated
that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir
structure and the periodicity of the dataset.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像识别基准上实现了超过3倍的不确定性增强，且准确率下降小于0.2%。

Conclusion: 该框架为终端用户提供了额外的隐私保护工具。

Abstract: Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in
machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue
to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence.
This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model
predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat
model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In
particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses
which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an
algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on
protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our
core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that
explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a
certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous
bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms
incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than
pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition
benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional
protection to end users.

TL;DR: SpeCa是一种新型的'预测-验证'加速框架，通过引入Speculative Sampling和参数无关的验证机制，显著提升了扩散模型的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高质量图像和视频合成中表现出色，但其计算需求限制了实时应用。主要挑战包括无法并行化和计算密集的前向传递。

Method: SpeCa采用Speculative Sampling预测中间特征，并通过验证机制评估预测可靠性，动态分配计算资源。

Result: 实验显示，SpeCa在多个数据集上实现了6.34x至7.3x的加速，质量下降极小（5.5%），验证机制开销仅为1.67%-3.5%。

Conclusion: SpeCa为高效扩散模型推理提供了新范式，在激进加速比下仍能保持生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler
samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.
Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality
degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation
fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The
verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference
costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference
while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Answer-Then-Check的安全对齐方法，通过增强LLM对恶意提示的鲁棒性，在生成最终答案前进行安全性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，防止其被越狱攻击成为关键挑战。

Method: 提出Answer-Then-Check方法，构建ReSA数据集（80K样本），训练模型先回答问题再评估安全性。

Result: 实验显示该方法在安全性和拒绝率上表现优异，同时保持通用推理能力，且仅需少量数据即可达到类似效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升安全性，还能生成安全替代回答，且数据需求低于预期。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring
their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this
paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check,
which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking
ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to
the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their
thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to
provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety
Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason
through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety
capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.
Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning
capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our
method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike
post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide
helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm).
Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples
can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that
safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、概率解释性和适应动态流量模式方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的异常检测方法。

Method: 结合时间多张量素描和CMS-CU技术，使用贝叶斯推断进行概率评分，并通过EWMA自适应阈值调整。

Result: 在四个真实入侵检测数据集上表现优异，AUC提升最高达15.6%，处理速度快且内存占用低。

Conclusion: ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH是一种高效、实用的方法，适用于大规模流图快速异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious
activities, fraud, and unexpected behaviors in real-world systems such as
cybersecurity and power grids. However, existing approaches struggle with
scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving
traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight
and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data.
Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch
using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns
with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate
Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst
intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection
datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC
gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20
million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results
show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate
anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs.

Conclusion: 在线数据源可以作为传统方法的有效补充，提供更及时和全面的灾害影响评估。

Abstract: Assessing the impact of a disaster in terms of asset losses and human
casualties is essential for preparing effective response plans. Traditional
methods include offline assessments conducted on the ground, where volunteers
and first responders work together to collect the estimate of losses through
windshield surveys or on-ground inspection. However, these methods have a time
delay and are prone to different biases. Recently, various online data sources,
including social media, news reports, aerial imagery, and satellite data, have
been utilized to evaluate the impact of disasters. Online data sources provide
real-time data streams for estimating the offline impact. Limited research
exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at a given
administrative unit. In our work, we curate a comprehensive dataset by
collecting data from multiple online sources for a few billion-dollar disasters
at the county level. We also analyze how online estimates compare with
traditional offline-based impact estimates for the disaster. Our findings
provide insight into how different sources can provide complementary
information to assess the disaster.

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估电信领域3GPP文档中序列图转换为PlantUML脚本性能的指标，并比较了两种VLMs的转换效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未对不同组件的PlantUML脚本转换效果进行比较，需要量化评估转换准确性。

Method: 选择3GPP文档中的序列图数据集，比较Claude Sonnet和GPT-4V生成的puml脚本与人工标注的真实值，使用版本控制工具和性能指标评估准确性。

Result: 节点、边和消息转换准确，但复杂结构（如注释、框、组）表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需在训练数据中更好地表示复杂结构以提升VLMs的转换效果。

Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: 传统灾害分析工具缺乏干预性，无法模拟反事实情景。

Method: 利用卫星图像、新闻和社交媒体等实时数据源，开发干预性工具。

Result: 工具能评估灾害严重性并提供因果归因和可操作建议。

Conclusion: 工具公开可用，有助于灾害缓解规划。

Abstract: Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity
of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data,
these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental
conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these
systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user
can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if"
scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that
complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data
sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps
understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated
severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable
recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is
publicly available.

Conclusion: CANOE能够对不同混沌级别的移动轨迹进行鲁棒预测，并通过消融研究验证了其设计有效性。

Abstract: Next location prediction is a key task in human mobility analysis, crucial
for applications like smart city resource allocation and personalized
navigation services. However, existing methods face two significant challenges:
first, they fail to address the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic
mobile patterns, leading to inadequate adaptation over sparse trajectories;
second, they underutilize contextual cues, such as temporal regularities in
arrival times, which persist even in chaotic patterns and offer stronger
predictability than spatial forecasts due to reduced search spaces. To tackle
these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a
\underline{\textbf{C}}h\underline{\textbf{A}}otic \underline{\textbf{N}}eural
\underline{\textbf{O}}scillator n\underline{\textbf{E}}twork for next location
prediction, which introduces a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory
Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention,
enabling balanced representation of evolving mobility behaviors, and employs a
Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder along with a Cross Context Attentive Decoder to
fuse multimodal ``who-when-where'' contexts in a joint framework for enhanced
prediction performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that CANOE consistently and significantly outperforms a sizeable
collection of state-of-the-art baselines, yielding 3.17\%-13.11\% improvement
over the best-performing baselines across different cases. In particular, CANOE
can make robust predictions over mobility trajectories of different mobility
chaotic levels. A series of ablation studies also supports our key design
choices. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yuqian2003/CANOE.

Conclusion: 结果强调了在SI场景中为大型模型开发更强大隐私保护机制的紧迫性。

Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

Abstract: Understanding how atmospheric molecular clusters form and grow is key to
resolving one of the biggest uncertainties in climate modelling: the formation
of new aerosol particles. While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into
these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale
exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly
powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By
leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced
metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we
show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression
(KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of
magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established
Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other
descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar
performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set
and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and
sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical
accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even
appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often
nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward
uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for
accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.

Result: 结果表明，结合航次报告与气候和海洋数据的机器学习技术能有效预测燃料消耗。

Conclusion: 研究验证了数据融合的潜力，但需在同类船舶上进一步验证其普适性。

Abstract: There is an increasing push for operational measures to reduce ships' bunker
fuel consumption and carbon emissions, driven by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) mandates. Key performance indicators such as the Energy
Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) focus on fuel efficiency. Strategies
like trim optimization, virtual arrival, and green routing have emerged. The
theoretical basis for these approaches lies in accurate prediction of fuel
consumption as a function of sailing speed, displacement, trim, climate, and
sea state. This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel
over one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters,
integrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment
Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to
evaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy
and to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption.
The results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to
predict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with
climate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains
necessary to confirm generalizability.

Conclusion: 正则化方案能够有效改善PINNs的训练效果，避免物理不正确的解。

Abstract: It was recently shown that the loss function used for training
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibits local minima at solutions
corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems. In the forward setting,
where the PINN is trained to solve initial value problems, these local minima
can interfere with training and potentially leading to physically incorrect
solutions. Building on stability theory, this paper proposes a regularization
scheme that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points.
Experimental results on four dynamical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra
model and the van der Pol oscillator, show that our scheme helps avoiding
physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves the training success
rate of PINNs.

Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics,
reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates
remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of
experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme
sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines
a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract
features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures
informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is
incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate
representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that
govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate
predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms
both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work
provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for
applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

Abstract: Real-time fall detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions and
mitigating the severe health consequences of falls, particularly in older

robust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper
presents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without
prior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent
efficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To
enhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes
the decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of
missed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high
recall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00,
Precision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls
while keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per
sample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances
the robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. They also highlight the
potential of our computationally efficient framework for deployment in
real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data,
with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter
optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We
address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction
method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of
over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and
preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses
the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of
high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that
architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly
impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final
prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient
designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.

Motivation: 现有遗忘技术和安全训练无法有效移除语言模型中的危险知识，需找到更精准的方法。

Method: 使用PCA分析激活和模块输出梯度，识别并压缩包含特定知识的子空间，避免影响通用表示。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B模型上，对WMDP数据集的遗忘效果显著优于基线（生物危害事实提升80倍，网络危害事实提升30倍），且通用性能损失极小（仅0.1% WikiText损失增加）。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、精准，能在极短时间内（每事实<3 GPU秒）实现稳健遗忘，且不影响模型整体性能。

Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove
dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and
propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without
disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify
subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before
calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general
representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack
accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous
facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general
performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less
than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

TL;DR: FedDAF是一种新的联邦域适应方法，通过相似性聚合源模型和目标模型，解决域偏移和目标数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略域偏移和数据稀缺的双重挑战，且未能根据目标需求优先共享源信息。

Result: 实验表明，FedDAF在测试准确率上优于现有FL、PFL和FDA方法。

Conclusion: FedDAF有效解决了域偏移和数据稀缺问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

Abstract: Long-term unemployment (LTU) is a challenge for both jobseekers and public
employment services. Statistical profiling tools are increasingly used to
predict LTU risk. Some profiling tools are opaque, black-box machine learning
models, which raise issues of transparency and fairness. This paper
investigates whether interpretable models could serve as an alternative, using
administrative data from Switzerland. Traditional statistical, interpretable,
and black-box models are compared in terms of predictive performance,
interpretability, and fairness. It is shown that explainable boosting machines,
a recent interpretable model, perform nearly as well as the best black-box
models. It is also shown how model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness
mitigation can enhance transparency and fairness with only minor losses in
performance. These findings suggest that interpretable profiling provides an
accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without
compromising performance.

Abstract: Evaluating tabular generators remains a challenging problem, as the unique
causal structural prior of heterogeneous tabular data does not lend itself to
intuitive human inspection. Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a
tabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies
with the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often
neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation
dimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model
performance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as
quantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to
ground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world
datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly
considers structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, $\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the
assessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal
structures. In addition, we present $\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular
generators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results
demonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic
lens for tabular generator performance. We release the TabStruct benchmark
suite, including all datasets, evaluation pipelines, and raw results. Code is

Conclusion: 该方法为随机渗透率场的多孔弹性系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的替代建模技术。

Abstract: Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media
-- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface
systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely
used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse
problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often
prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate
models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity
with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a
surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a
neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution
operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic
responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three
strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input
dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Lo\'eve expansion, and a two-step
training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk
networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in
poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater
extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in
inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of
permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for
poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

Motivation: 理解LLM输出的立场如何受信息源影响，避免LLM检索系统被操纵。

Method: 应用MillStone基准测试九种主流LLM，评估其对对立论点的开放程度、一致性及论点说服力。

Result: LLM在多数争议问题上表现开放，但权威信息源易改变其立场。

Conclusion: 需重视信息源选择，防止LLM检索系统被操纵。

Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

Motivation: 研究科学出版数据与金融市场数据之间的关系，以预测未来类似泡沫的兴起与衰落。

Method: 利用时间序列社交网络分析（SNA）比较互联网时代（1994-2001）和AI时代（2017-2024）的引用网络与市场数据。

Result: 互联网泡沫的模式未能明确预测AI泡沫的兴起与衰落，但发现部分AI时代科学家的引用模式与互联网泡沫时期相似。

Conclusion: 互联网泡沫时期的模式无法直接应用于AI市场，AI时代可能存在新型泡沫或根本不存在泡沫。

Abstract: Financial bubbles often arrive without much warning, but create long-lasting
economic effects. For example, during the dot-com bubble, innovative
technologies created market disruptions through excitement for a promised
bright future. Such technologies originated from research where scientists had
developed them for years prior to their entry into the markets. That raises a
question on the possibility of analyzing scientific publishing data (e.g.
citation networks) leading up to a bubble for signals that may forecast the
rise and fall of similar future bubbles. To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs
to detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of
scientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting
technology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024.
Results showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a
bubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble. While
yearly citation networks reflected possible changes in publishing behavior of
scientists between the two eras, there was a subset of AI era scientists whose
publication influence patterns mirrored those during the dot-com era. Upon
further analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH),
the data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form
of financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists. In conclusion, our
findings imply that the patterns present in the dot-com era do not effectively
translate in such a manner to apply them to the AI market.

Conclusion: 理论证明了低秩矩阵符号梯度下降和低秩Muon的迭代复杂度，支持其在重尾噪声下的有效性。

Abstract: Neural network (NN) training is inherently a large-scale matrix optimization
problem, yet the matrix structure of NN parameters has long been overlooked.
Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this
structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in
foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is
matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank
orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients
during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed
gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the
low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining --
surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically,
we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient
descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of
low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under
heavy-tailed noise.

Result: 在基准和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于传统的基于相似性的方法。

Conclusion: USimUL框架有效减少了标签泄漏风险，同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Existing similarity-based weakly supervised learning approaches often rely on
precise similarity annotations between data pairs, which may inadvertently
expose sensitive label information and raise privacy risks. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL), a novel
framework where each similarity pair is embedded with an uncertainty component
to reduce label leakage. In this paper, we propose an unbiased risk estimator
that learns from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data. Additionally, we
theoretically prove that the estimator achieves statistically optimal
parametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification
performance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效泛化专家行为，适用于新环境和约束条件。

Abstract: We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided
through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints.
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to
recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in
the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is
inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible
set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce
different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional
information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.
In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the
"average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset
of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by
planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a
closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for
estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations
only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the
relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our
method.

Conclusion: AMQ成功解决了大规模量化搜索的挑战。

Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

Result: 在合成基准测试中，签名变换编码器表现优于RNN编码器。

Conclusion: 签名变换为连续时间非马尔可夫动力学建模提供了高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations offer an effective framework for
modeling dynamical systems by learning a continuous-time vector field. However,
they rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the
current state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the
dynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes
especially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex
systems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies,
existing approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based
encoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling.
In addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we
investigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning
non-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform
offers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and
proven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We
integrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics
models and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test
performance on synthetic benchmarks.

Result: RS-KT利用动态信息显著降低了样本复杂度，数值模拟验证了非马尔可夫策略的样本效率和优势。

Conclusion: 风险敏感模仿学习能有效匹配专家的风险态度，非马尔可夫策略和动态信息利用是关键。

Abstract: We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)
agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only
to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average
performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return
distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the
risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's
return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting
and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited
expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and
sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.
Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC
and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and
known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample
complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further
demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the
setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based
variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and
RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and
the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL
algorithms.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效适应交通随机性和环境变化，提供可靠的预测和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving
safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a
prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and
environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of
accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and
complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency
matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)
values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather
factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights
and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic
stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to
adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental
conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)
framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target
coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline
methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,
validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying
Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under
Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of
the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying
the model's robustness.

Result: 在AAPL股票的回测中，Hi-DARTS实现了25.17%的累计回报和0.75的夏普比率，优于被动持有策略和S&P 500 ETF。

Conclusion: 动态分层智能体能在保持高计算效率的同时实现更优的风险调整回报。

Abstract: Conventional autonomous trading systems struggle to balance computational
efficiency and market responsiveness due to their fixed operating frequency. We
propose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market
volatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for
high-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL
stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of
25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard
benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return)
and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return). Our work demonstrates that dynamic,
hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while
maintaining high computational efficiency.

*Xi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的超曲面决策树（HODT）算法，解决了现有最优决策树方法仅限于超平面分割的问题，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最优决策树方法仅适用于超平面分割，无法处理更一般的超曲面分割问题，因此需要一种新的算法来解决这一局限性。

Method: 基于第一部分的理论基础，提出了一种无需外部求解器的超曲面决策树算法（HODT），并通过合成和真实数据集进行验证。

Result: 在合成数据集中，HODT算法比轴平行树更准确地恢复真实模型，且对噪声更具鲁棒性；在30个真实数据集中，HODT的准确率比现有最优轴平行决策树算法高出30%。

Conclusion: HODT算法在超曲面分割问题上表现出色，不仅提高了准确性，还增强了鲁棒性，为决策树优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks
due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal
decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization
task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is
NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper
decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four
formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four
generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees
satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties
of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial
hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the
algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the
first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to
hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on
general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general
hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision
trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature
noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more
accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.
We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,
showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the
state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree
complexity is properly controlled.

TL;DR: 利用叶片光谱反射和集成机器学习早期检测番茄寄生杂草分枝列当，准确率达89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分枝列当是一种无叶绿素的寄生杂草，威胁番茄生产，需早期检测以减少产量损失。

Method: 通过便携式光谱仪采集叶片反射数据，预处理后结合随机森林、XGBoost、SVM和朴素贝叶斯进行集成学习。

Result: 在585 GDD时检测准确率达89%，但随生长阶段下降至69%。

Conclusion: 近端传感与集成学习可在症状显现前检测分枝列当，支持针对性干预。

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic
weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We
investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)
and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,
we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree
days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and
preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,
correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near
1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf
water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random
Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at
585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy
declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and
weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and
environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble
learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are
visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

Result: 在多个基准测试和气候数据集中，平均减少20%以上的均方误差，并展示出卓越的可解释性。

Conclusion: UDE是一种可扩展、可解释的通用时间序列建模框架，具有广泛的科学和工业应用潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained
foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through
principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator
prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical
representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches
from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological
properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images,
which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning
technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for
learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of
nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear
manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and
real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean
squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior
generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical
representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit
exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically
informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics,
establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal
time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图机器学习模型在节点级别表现差异大，但标准评估指标（如准确率）掩盖了这些差异，难以诊断模型失败的具体情况。

Method: NodePro结合数据信号（如特征差异、标签不确定性、结构模糊性）和模型信号（如预测置信度、训练一致性），为节点分配配置文件分数。

Result: NodePro揭示了模型间的系统性差异，即使聚合指标相似，且支持无真实标签的预测可靠性评估。

Conclusion: NodePro在真实场景中有效识别不一致或损坏的节点，展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Graph machine learning models often achieve similar overall performance yet
behave differently at the node level, failing on different subsets of nodes
with varying reliability. Standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy obscure
these fine grained differences, making it difficult to diagnose when and where
models fail. We introduce NodePro, a node profiling framework that enables
fine-grained diagnosis of model behavior by assigning interpretable profile
scores to individual nodes. These scores combine data-centric signals, such as
feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, and structural ambiguity, with
model-centric measures of prediction confidence and consistency during
training. By aligning model behavior with these profiles, NodePro reveals
systematic differences between models, even when aggregate metrics are
indistinguishable. We show that node profiles generalize to unseen nodes,
supporting prediction reliability without ground-truth labels. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of NodePro in identifying semantically inconsistent or
corrupted nodes in a structured knowledge graph, illustrating its effectiveness
in real-world settings.

TL;DR: KPG方法通过递归更新策略解决多智能体强化学习中的协调问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未考虑其他智能体同时更新策略，导致协调不足。

Method: 提出K-Level Policy Gradient (KPG)，递归更新策略以优化协调。

Result: 理论证明KPG在有限迭代下收敛到局部纳什均衡，实验显示在StarCraft II和MuJoCo中表现优越。

Conclusion: KPG在多智能体强化学习中有效提升协调性和性能。

Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of
other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for
the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in
miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient
(KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated
policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated
policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves
monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We
provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL
algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior
performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent
MuJoCo.

Abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented
events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these
out-of-distribution (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding
climate adaptation. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in
providing precise, high-speed climate predictions, their ability to generalize
under distribution shifts remains a significant limitation that has been
underexplored in climate contexts. This research systematically evaluates
state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in diverse OOD scenarios by adapting
established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data. Experiments on
large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability across scenarios,
shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models. These
findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide
actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk
forecasting.

Result: 梯度流在鞍点附近停留较长时间，小权重方向收敛；NP算法在实验中表现有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了梯度流在鞍点附近的行为，NP算法为深度网络训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The first part of this paper studies the evolution of gradient flow for
homogeneous neural networks near a class of saddle points exhibiting a sparsity
structure. The choice of these saddle points is motivated from previous works
on homogeneous networks, which identified the first saddle point encountered by
gradient flow after escaping the origin. It is shown here that, when
initialized sufficiently close to such saddle points, gradient flow remains
near the saddle point for a sufficiently long time, during which the set of
weights with small norm remain small but converge in direction. Furthermore,
important empirical observations are made on the behavior of gradient descent
after escaping these saddle points. The second part of the paper, motivated by
these results, introduces a greedy algorithm to train deep neural networks
called Neuron Pursuit (NP). It is an iterative procedure which alternates
between expanding the network by adding neuron(s) with carefully chosen
weights, and minimizing the training loss using this augmented network. The
efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 娱乐和AI领域对人脸合成和编辑的需求增加，但现有方法在无配对、未对齐数据集上难以保持细节和身份。

Method: 结合谱归一化、身份和感知引导损失、以及地标加权循环约束，改进CycleGAN框架。

Result: 在FID、LPIPS和ID-Sim指标上优于自编码器，接近pix2pix在配对数据上的表现。

Conclusion: 改进的CycleGAN为无配对人脸编辑提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Human face synthesis and manipulation are increasingly important in
entertainment and AI, with a growing demand for highly realistic,
identity-preserving images even when only unpaired, unaligned datasets are
available. We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving
from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While
autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our
approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and
perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure,
and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose
and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained
CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity
preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction
SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired
datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results
demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical
path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.

Conclusion: 论文为材料生成模型的评估提供了更可靠的数据集和指标，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold
potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and
structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks
and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation.
This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a
crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely
structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key
issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for
example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains
$\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split
randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we
find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if
used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the
structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these
oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions
of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and
split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but
with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset
which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more
sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe
and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with
the match rate metric.

Conclusion: Event2Vec在事件序列表示中有效，双曲空间适合层次结构。

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态关系启动的注意力机制（prime attention），用于改进标准注意力在多元时间序列数据中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制在处理多元时间序列数据时，由于静态的token表示无法捕捉不同通道间的异质性关系，表现受限。

Method: 通过动态调整每个token的表示，优化每对token的交互，以捕捉其独特的关系动态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，prime attention比标准注意力表现更好，预测精度提升高达6.5%，且序列长度减少40%时仍能保持或超越标准注意力的性能。

Conclusion: prime attention能够更有效地建模多元时间序列中的异质性关系，同时保持计算复杂度不变。

Abstract: Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token
representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each
layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially
diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in
domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static
relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous
inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where
different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by
entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the
attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with
dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where
each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise
interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per
interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique
relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction
for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime
attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in
MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard
attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently
outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\%
improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention
achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence
length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior
relational modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous
driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic
participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving
safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy,
they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of
interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak
generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models
(LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This
survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for
trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs
facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing
prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article
highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal
fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both
vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key
challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world
robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including
low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to motion planning and risk analysis for
enhancing human-robot collaboration using a Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle (MRAV).
The proposed method uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to encode key mission
objectives, such as safety, timing, and human preferences, with a strong focus
on ergonomics and comfort. An optimization framework generates dynamically
feasible trajectories while considering the MRAV's physical constraints. Given
the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, smooth approximations and
gradient-based techniques assist in handling the problem's computational
complexity. Additionally, an uncertainty-aware risk analysis is incorporated to
assess potential deviations from the mission specifications, providing insights
into the likelihood of mission success under uncertain conditions. Further, an
event-triggered replanning strategy is implemented to respond to unforeseen
events and external disturbances. The approach is validated through MATLAB and
Gazebo simulations, using an object handover task in a mock-up environment
inspired by power line maintenance scenarios. The results highlight the
method's effectiveness in achieving safe, efficient, and resilient human-robot
collaboration.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of endoscopic devices for several cancer
screening procedures, manual control of these devices still remains challenging
for clinicians, leading to several critical issues such as increased workload,
fatigue, and distractions. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce
the design and development of an intuitive, modular, and easily installable
mechatronic framework. This framework includes (i) a novel nested collet-chuck
gripping mechanism that can readily be integrated and assembled with the
existing endoscopic devices and control their bending degrees-of-freedom
(DoFs); (ii) a feeder mechanism that can control the insertion/retraction DoF
of a colonoscope, and (iii) a complementary and intuitive user interface that
enables simultaneous control of all DoFs during the procedure. To analyze the
design of the proposed mechanisms, we also introduce a mathematical modeling
approach and a design space for optimal selection of the parameters involved in
the design of gripping and feeder mechanisms. Our simulation and experimental
studies thoroughly demonstrate the performance of the proposed mathematical
modeling and robotic framework.

TL;DR: 利用GPU加速视觉-惯性SLAM系统中的跟踪模块，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM系统的跟踪模块处理速度较慢，可能导致定位不准确或跟踪丢失。

Method: 通过GPU加速耗时组件（如立体特征匹配和局部地图跟踪），并在ORB-SLAM3中实现CUDA优化。

Result: 在桌面和Jetson Xavier NX平台上，跟踪性能提升高达2.8倍。

Conclusion: GPU加速显著提升了SLAM系统的跟踪性能。

Abstract: The tracking module of a visual-inertial SLAM system processes incoming image
frames and IMU data to estimate the position of the frame in relation to the
map. It is important for the tracking to complete in a timely manner for each
frame to avoid poor localization or tracking loss. We therefore present a new
approach which leverages GPU computing power to accelerate time-consuming
components of tracking in order to improve its performance. These components
include stereo feature matching and local map tracking. We implement our design
inside the ORB-SLAM3 tracking process using CUDA. Our evaluation demonstrates
an overall improvement in tracking performance of up to 2.8x on a desktop and
Jetson Xavier NX board in stereo-inertial mode, using the well-known SLAM
datasets EuRoC and TUM-VI.

specific person -- has emerging applications in personal assistance, security
patrols, eldercare, and logistics. To be effective, such robots must follow the
target while ensuring safety and comfort for both the target and surrounding
people. In this work, we present the first end-to-end study of RPF, which (i)

this testing machine, we carried out removal of initial wire stretch,
measurement of tension transmission efficiency for eight different diameters of

force control of an actual wire-driven robot, reducing the end-effector force
error.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂3D环境中的推理不稳定且难以平衡长时语义推理与低延迟控制，影响了泛化能力和实时导航效果。

Method: 构建Nav-CoT-110K数据集，设计GRPO强化学习框架（含格式、理解和导航奖励），并引入Fast-in-Slow推理范式。

Result: 在具身AI基准测试中平均提升8%的推理和导航性能，并在移动机器人上验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Nav-R1通过结构化推理和高效导航范式，显著提升了具身导航的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and
action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches
often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder
generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing
long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time
navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied
foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first
construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought
(CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with
structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based
reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format,
understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic
grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow
reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency
reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations
on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms
strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation
performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its
robustness under limited onboard resources. Code:

Motivation: 解决现有柔性触觉传感器在编码效率和布线复杂性上的瓶颈，以实现大规模、高灵敏度的触觉感知。

Method: 采用码分多址（CDMA）启发的正交数字编码策略，实现分布式传感节点的并行信号传输。

Conclusion: 该架构为开发具有人类感官能力的可扩展智能系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Human-like embodied tactile perception is crucial for the next-generation
intelligent robotics. Achieving large-area, full-body soft coverage with high
sensitivity and rapid response, akin to human skin, remains a formidable
challenge due to critical bottlenecks in encoding efficiency and wiring
complexity in existing flexible tactile sensors, thus significantly hinder the
scalability and real-time performance required for human skin-level tactile
perception. Herein, we present a new architecture employing code division
multiple access-inspired orthogonal digital encoding to overcome these
challenges. Our decentralized encoding strategy transforms conventional serial
signal transmission by enabling parallel superposition of energy-orthogonal
base codes from distributed sensing nodes, drastically reducing wiring
requirements and increasing data throughput. We implemented and validated this
strategy with off-the-shelf 16-node sensing array to reconstruct the pressure
distribution, achieving a temporal resolution of 12.8 ms using only a single
transmission wire. Crucially, the architecture can maintain sub-20ms latency
across orders-of-magnitude variations in node number (to thousands of nodes).
By fundamentally redefining signal encoding paradigms in soft electronics, this
work opens new frontiers in developing scalable embodied intelligent systems
with human-like sensory capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机器人系统面临数据完整性攻击的威胁，现有检测方法难以应对，需要开发更有效的检测手段。

Method: 利用视觉估计与编码器数据交叉验证，结合SAM-Track生成掩码，低秩张量回归和矩阵变量高斯过程建模残差，设计在线检测器。

Result: 在真实机器人测试平台上验证，ViSTR-GP能准确恢复关节角度，并在早期检测到攻击，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过独立物理通道检测数据完整性攻击是可行的，无需复杂仪器，且能绕过控制器权限。

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing
operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks
that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations.
Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated
exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and
manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only
existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the
challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks
in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework,
ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a
vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's
authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes
SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate
maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models
nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A
frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an
online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a
real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data,
collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios
with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the
proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity
attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These
improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show
that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical
channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex
instrumentation.

Result: 在四种机器人平台上，ImMimic显著提高了任务成功率和执行流畅度。

Conclusion: ImMimic能有效缩小领域差距，提升机器人操作的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation from abundant human videos offers a scalable
alternative to costly robot-specific data collection. However, domain gaps
across visual, morphological, and physical aspects hinder direct imitation. To
effectively bridge the domain gap, we propose ImMimic, an embodiment-agnostic
co-training framework that leverages both human videos and a small amount of
teleoperated robot demonstrations. ImMimic uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with
either action- or visual-based mapping to map retargeted human hand poses to
robot joints, followed by MixUp interpolation between paired human and robot
trajectories. Our key insights are (1) retargeted human hand trajectories
provide informative action labels, and (2) interpolation over the mapped data
creates intermediate domains that facilitate smooth domain adaptation during
co-training. Evaluations on four real-world manipulation tasks (Pick and Place,
Push, Hammer, Flip) across four robotic embodiments (Robotiq, Fin Ray, Allegro,
Ability) show that ImMimic improves task success rates and execution
smoothness, highlighting its efficacy to bridge the domain gap for robust robot
manipulation. The project website can be found at

Conclusion: Pogosim为Pogobots的算法开发和测试提供了高效工具，解决了资源消耗问题，并支持无缝过渡到实际机器人实验。

Abstract: Pogobots are a new type of open-source/open-hardware robots specifically
designed for swarm robotics research. Their cost-effective and modular design,
complemented by vibration-based and wheel-based locomotion, fast infrared
communication and extensive software architecture facilitate the implementation
of swarm intelligence algorithms. However, testing even simple distributed
algorithms directly on robots is particularly labor-intensive. Scaling to more
complex problems or calibrate user code parameters will have a prohibitively
high strain on available resources. In this article we present Pogosim, a fast
and scalable simulator for Pogobots, designed to reduce as much as possible
algorithm development costs. The exact same code will be used in both
simulation and to experimentally drive real robots. This article details the
software architecture of Pogosim, explain how to write configuration files and
user programs and how simulations approximate or differ from experiments. We
describe how a large set of simulations can be launched in parallel, how to
retrieve and analyze the simulation results, and how to optimize user code
parameters using optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: 无人机系统能够高效、低成本地完成光伏面板涂层的自动喷涂任务。

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain
of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects.
Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but
degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more
often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this
letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion
mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses
onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position
of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on
a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass
decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy
capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.

Conclusion: 研究为多机器人协调提供了新问题定义和有效算法，对农业自动化有理论和实践贡献。

Abstract: The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of
multi-robot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating
these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and
energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like
load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the
multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA)
problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world
constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route
reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms,
including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization
method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction
operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's
superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical
analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically
validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously
inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research
contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by
offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also
providing practical insights for agricultural automation.

Abstract: The embodied intelligence bridges the physical world and information space.
As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise
through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware
platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin,
was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection
of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of
humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced
Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary
modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and
Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale
wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse
features from both time-domain and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to
capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby
enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT
improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking
with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in
real-world.

Result: 在10个模拟和5个真实任务中，成功率比现有方法高44.7%，且参数减少80%。

Conclusion: 学习几何一致的表示对非结构化环境中的机器人操作具有显著效果。

Abstract: Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world
manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained
from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an
unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to
manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration
or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we
propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic
manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through
self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates
ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point
cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate
system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an
efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over
5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at
unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world
tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than
state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer
parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong
sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically
consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured
environments. Our project website can be found in

Motivation: 由于四旋翼的非线性动力学和欠驱动特性，以及电缆悬挂负载引入的额外自由度和混合性，设计鲁棒控制器具有挑战性。传统方法需要大量调参且无法适应配置变化。

Method: 使用强化学习策略作为鲁棒跟踪控制器，通过任务和领域随机化训练，适应不同负载配置。

Result: 控制器在零样本情况下能泛化到不同负载设置（无负载、不同质量和电缆长度），无需切换或重新调整。

Conclusion: RoVerFly结合了学习方法的适应性和反馈控制器的可解释性，为复杂系统提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing robust controllers for precise, arbitrary trajectory tracking with
quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and
becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that introduce extra
degrees of freedom and hybridness. Classical model-based methods offer
stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often do not adapt when
the configuration changes, such as when a payload is added or removed, or when
the payload mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified
learning-based control framework in which a reinforcement learning (RL) policy
serves as a robust and versatile tracking controller for standard quadrotors
and for cable-suspended payload systems across a range of configurations.
Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to
disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across payload settings, including no payload as well as varying mass and cable
length, without controller switching or re-tuning, while retaining the
interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller. Code and

Result: 实验表明，SAMP在成功率和碰撞率上分别提高了11%和降低了7%。

Conclusion: SAMP通过联合建模机器人和环境几何形状，在复杂现实环境中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Neural-based motion planning methods have achieved remarkable progress for
robotic manipulators, yet a fundamental challenge lies in simultaneously
accounting for both the robot's physical shape and the surrounding environment
when generating safe and feasible motions. Moreover, existing approaches often
rely on simplified robot models or focus primarily on obstacle representation,
which can lead to incomplete collision detection and degraded performance in
cluttered scenes. To address these limitations, we propose spatial anchor-based
motion policy (SAMP), a unified framework that simultaneously encodes the
environment and the manipulator using signed distance field (SDF) anchored on a
shared spatial grid. SAMP incorporates a dedicated robot SDF network that
captures the manipulator's precise geometry, enabling collision-aware reasoning
beyond coarse link approximations. These representations are fused on spatial
anchors and used to train a neural motion policy that generates smooth,
collision-free trajectories in the proposed efficient feature alignment
strategy. Experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments
consistently show that SAMP outperforms existing methods, delivering an 11%
increase in success rate and a 7% reduction in collision rate. These results
highlight the benefits of jointly modelling robot and environment geometry,
demonstrating its practical value in challenging real-world environments.

Result: 在VLN-CE和真实测试中，DreamNav在SR和SPL指标上分别提升7.49%和18.15%，达到零样本SOTA。

Conclusion: DreamNav首次统一了轨迹级规划和主动想象力，仅使用自我中心输入，显著提升了零样本VLN性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

TL;DR: MEMBOT是一种模块化记忆架构，用于解决机器人控制任务中的间歇性部分可观测性问题，通过分离信念推断与策略学习，显著提升了在观测缺失情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器人系统常面临部分或间歇性观测问题，传统强化学习方法假设完全可观测性，难以应对这些挑战。

Method: MEMBOT采用两阶段训练：离线多任务预训练学习任务无关的潜在信念编码器，再通过行为克隆微调任务特定策略。

Result: 在10个机器人操作任务中，MEMBOT在50%观测缺失下仍保持80%性能，优于无记忆和简单循环基线。

Conclusion: 显式信念建模能实现鲁棒、可迁移且数据高效的部分可观测机器人策略。

Abstract: Robotic systems deployed in real-world environments often operate under
conditions of partial and often intermittent observability, where sensor inputs
may be noisy, occluded, or entirely unavailable due to failures or
environmental constraints. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches
that assume full state observability are ill-equipped for such challenges. In
this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to
address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT
decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training
process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust
task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by
fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief
encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates
temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state
representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and
evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and
Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT
consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recurrent baselines,
maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of explicit belief modeling in
achieving robust, transferable, and data-efficient policies for real-world
partially observable robotic systems.

<details>

Motivation: 无人机上的强化学习部署面临模型依赖和平台特定感知的挑战，CORB-Planner旨在解决这些问题，实现跨平台通用性。

Method: 结合B样条轨迹生成和RL策略，利用启发式搜索生成紧凑的安全飞行走廊表示，采用渐进式训练和SDCQ算法。

Result: 在仿真和实际测试中，CORB-Planner实现了实时规划，支持最高8.2m/s的飞行速度，兼容多种无人机配置。

Conclusion: CORB-Planner展示了在复杂环境中高效、通用的轨迹规划能力，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in a large number of robotic
control tasks. Nevertheless, its deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
remains challenging, mainly because of reliance on accurate dynamic models and
platform-specific sensing, which hinders cross-platform transfer. This paper
presents the CORB-Planner (Corridor-as-Observations for RL B-spline planner), a
real-time, RL-based trajectory planning framework for high-speed autonomous UAV
flight across heterogeneous platforms. The key idea is to combine B-spline
trajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points
with a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic
search. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form,
mitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to
model inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard
progressive training pipeline in simulation. A value-based soft
decomposed-critic Q (SDCQ) algorithm is used to learn effective policies within
approximately ten minutes of training. Benchmarks in simulation and real-world
tests demonstrate real-time planning on lightweight onboard hardware and
support maximum flight speeds up to 8.2m/s in dense, cluttered environments
without external positioning. Compatibility with various UAV configurations
(quadrotors, hexarotors) and modest onboard compute underlines the generality
and robustness of CORB-Planner for practical deployment.

Result: 任务成功率提升至100%，感知误判次数从3.389降至1.128。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂工业环境中增强机器人智能的鲁棒性和适应性提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, the efficient
disassembly and recycling of power batteries have become a critical challenge
for the circular economy. In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the
dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic
perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in
industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework
based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the
adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our
approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a
bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and
optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously
collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual
system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly
scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception
misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for
enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex
industrial environments.

Abstract: Social robots offer a promising solution for autonomously guiding patients

advanced decision-making to adapt to patient needs. A key challenge is the
scarcity of patient behavior data for developing robust policies. To address
this, we engaged 33 expert healthcare practitioners as patient proxies, using
their interactions with our robot to inform a patient behavior model capable of
generating exercise performance metrics and subjective scores on perceived
exertion. We trained a reinforcement learning-based policy in simulation,
demonstrating that it can adapt exercise instructions to individual exertion
tolerances and fluctuating performance, while also being applicable to patients
at different recovery stages with varying exercise plans.

Conclusion: BRI技术未影响用户信任，机器人模仿动作在康复中有潜力。

Abstract: For social robots to maintain long-term engagement as exercise instructors,
rapport-building is essential. Motor mimicry--imitating one's physical
actions--during social interaction has long been recognized as a powerful tool
for fostering rapport, and it is widely used in rehabilitation exercises where
patients mirror a physiotherapist or video demonstration. We developed a novel
Brain-Robot Interface (BRI) that allows a social robot instructor to mimic a
patient's exercise movements in real-time, using mental commands derived from
the patient's intention. The system was evaluated in an exploratory study with
14 participants (3 physiotherapists and 11 hemiparetic patients recovering from
stroke or other injuries). We found our system successfully demonstrated
exercise mimicry in 12 sessions; however, accuracy varied. Participants had
positive perceptions of the robot instructor, with high trust and acceptance
levels, which were not affected by the introduction of BRI technology.

<details>

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了姿态估计中的模糊性和跟踪问题，提升了机器人操作的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable
robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under
viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects
move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active
pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with
"robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real
time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model,
compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a
geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy
(ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live
image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete
set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on
a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy,
and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated
pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field
of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy
trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that
preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in
simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms
classical baselines.

Result: 量子SAC比经典SAC平均回报高8%（246.40 vs 228.36），且学习步骤减少92%。

Conclusion: 量子计算在强化学习中具有加速学习的潜力，尤其在复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle in complex,
high-dimensional environments because of their extensive parameter requirements
and challenges posed by stochastic, non-deterministic settings. This study
introduces quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) to train humanoid agents
efficiently. While previous quantum RL models focused on smaller environments,
such as wheeled robots and robotic arms, our work pioneers the application of
QDRL to humanoid robotics, specifically in environments with substantial
observation and action spaces, such as MuJoCo's Humanoid-v4 and Walker2d-v4.
Using parameterized quantum circuits, we explored a hybrid quantum-classical
setup to directly navigate high-dimensional state spaces, bypassing traditional
mapping and planning. By integrating quantum computing with deep RL, we aim to
develop models that can efficiently learn complex navigation tasks in humanoid
robots. We evaluated the performance of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in
classical RL against its quantum implementation. The results show that the
quantum SAC achieves an 8% higher average return (246.40) than the classical
SAC (228.36) after 92% fewer steps, highlighting the accelerated learning
potential of quantum computing in RL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接微调机器人数据会破坏预训练表示并限制泛化能力，因此需要一种方法在适应任务时更好地保留这些特征。

Method: 采用双编码器设计（一个冻结的视觉编码器和一个可训练的编码器）、字符串动作标记化以及机器人演示与视觉语言数据集的协同训练。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上验证，方法提高了对视觉扰动的鲁棒性、对新指令和环境的泛化能力以及任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效保留了预训练特征，同时提升了机器人操作的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models
(VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build
generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct
fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits
generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained
features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces
three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to
retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a
string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character
sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training
strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets
emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on
real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations,
generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success
compared to baselines.

Abstract: Affordable desktop CNC routers are common in education, prototyping, and
makerspaces, but most lack a rotary axis, limiting fabrication of rotationally
symmetric or multi-sided parts. Existing solutions often require hardware
retrofits, alternative controllers, or commercial CAM software, raising cost
and complexity. This work presents a software-only framework for indexed rotary
machining on GRBL-based CNCs. A custom post-processor converts planar toolpaths
into discrete rotary steps, executed through a browser-based interface. While
not equivalent to continuous 4-axis machining, the method enables practical
rotary-axis fabrication using only standard, off-the-shelf mechanics, without
firmware modification. By reducing technical and financial barriers, the
framework expands access to multi-axis machining in classrooms, makerspaces,
and small workshops, supporting hands-on learning and rapid prototyping.

Motivation: 现代机器人控制系统（如基于强化学习的策略）通常对单一环境过拟合，难以适应新条件（如Sim2Real差距）。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用元模仿学习算法，通过训练1000个教师策略并将其蒸馏为一个自适应学生策略，利用隐藏层中的循环实现上下文学习。

Conclusion: RAPTOR方法展示了高度自适应的基础策略的潜力，能够快速适应新环境，为机器人控制提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions,
like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like
neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly
specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are
known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality
(Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even
minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for
training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method
enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide
variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg
that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs.
rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller
(PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy
with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide
variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made
possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained
through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000
quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement
Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive
student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation
policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the
capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory
tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).

Abstract: Fall recovery for legged robots remains challenging, particularly on complex
terrains where traditional controllers fail due to incomplete terrain
perception and uncertain interactions. We present \textbf{FR-Net}, a
learning-based framework that enables quadrupedal robots to recover from
arbitrary fall poses across diverse environments. Central to our approach is a
Mass-Contact Predictor network that estimates the robot's mass distribution and
contact states from limited sensory inputs, facilitating effective recovery
strategies. Our carefully designed reward functions ensure safe recovery even
on steep stairs without dangerous rolling motions common to existing methods.
Trained entirely in simulation using privileged learning, our framework guides
policy learning without requiring explicit terrain data during deployment. We
demonstrate the generalization capabilities of \textbf{FR-Net} across different
quadrupedal platforms in simulation and validate its performance through
extensive real-world experiments on the Go2 robot in 10 challenging scenarios.
Our results indicate that explicit mass-contact prediction is key to robust
fall recovery, offering a promising direction for generalizable quadrupedal
skills.

Abstract: Operating in environments too harsh or inaccessible for humans is one of the
critical roles expected of robots. However, such environments often pose risks
to electronic components as well. To overcome this, various approaches have
been developed, including autonomous mobile robots without electronics,
hydraulic remotely actuated mobile robots, and long-reach robot arms driven by
wires. Among these, electronics-free autonomous robots cannot make complex
decisions, while hydraulically actuated mobile robots and wire-driven robot
arms are used in harsh environments such as nuclear power plants. Mobile robots
offer greater reach and obstacle avoidance than robot arms, and wire mechanisms
offer broader environmental applicability than hydraulics. However, wire-driven
systems have not been used for remote actuation of mobile robots. In this
study, we propose a novel mechanism called Remote Wire Drive that enables
remote actuation of mobile robots via wires. This mechanism is a series
connection of decoupled joints, a mechanism used in wire-driven robot arms,
adapted for power transmission. We experimentally validated its feasibility by
actuating a wire-driven quadruped robot, which we also developed in this study,
through Remote Wire Drive.

Conclusion: PaiP通过交互感知和触觉反馈有效解决了堆叠物体场景中的运动规划挑战。

Abstract: Box/cabinet scenarios with stacked objects pose significant challenges for
robotic motion due to visual occlusions and constrained free space. Traditional
collision-free trajectory planning methods often fail when no collision-free
paths exist, and may even lead to catastrophic collisions caused by invisible
objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose an operational aware
interactive motion planner (PaiP) a real-time closed-loop planning framework
utilizing multimodal tactile perception. This framework autonomously infers
object interaction features by perceiving motion effects at interaction
interfaces. These interaction features are incorporated into grid maps to
generate operational cost maps. Building upon this representation, we extend
sampling-based planning methods to interactive planning by optimizing both path
cost and operational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that PaiP achieves
robust motion in narrow spaces.

Conclusion: 该研究为软连续机器人的实际形状控制铺平了道路。

Abstract: Soft continuum robots can allow for biocompatible yet compliant motions, such
as the ability of octopus arms to swim, crawl, and manipulate objects. However,
current state-of-the-art continuum robots can only achieve real-time task-space
control (i.e., tip control) but not whole-shape control, mainly due to the high
computational cost from its infinite degrees of freedom. In this paper, we
present a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for the shape control of
simulated multi-segment tendon-driven soft continuum robots with the Kirchhoff
rod model. Using data collected from these simulated soft robots, we conduct a
per-segment projection scheme on the state of the robots allowing for the
identification of control-affine Koopman models that are an order of magnitude
more accurate than without the projection scheme. Using these learned Koopman
models, we use a linear model predictive control (MPC) to control the robots to
a collection of target shapes of varying complexity. Our method realizes
computationally efficient closed-loop control, and demonstrates the feasibility
of real-time shape control for soft robots. We envision this work can pave the
way for practical shape control of soft continuum robots.

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：(1) 使用简单的距离-可见性规则自动标注大量低成本数据；(2) 通过少量高保真模拟试验细化模型以匹配真实抓取结果。

Result: 在仿真和真实移动机械臂上，GBPP优于仅基于接近度和几何的基线方法，选择更安全且可达的姿态，并在错误时优雅降级。

Conclusion: GBPP提供了一种实用的数据高效、几何感知的基础姿态选择方法：使用低成本启发式方法覆盖，再通过针对性模拟校准。

Abstract: GBPP is a fast learning based scorer that selects a robot base pose for
grasping from a single RGB-D snapshot. The method uses a two stage curriculum:
(1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost;
and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to
match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP
scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without
full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile
manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing
safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The
results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base
placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with
targeted simulation.

TL;DR: AssemMate利用图结构知识表示提升LLM在机器人装配任务中的实时性和精确性，支持知识图谱问答和视觉增强抓取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用自然语言文本表示知识，导致上下文冗长且冗余，难以满足机器人实时精确推理的需求。

Method: AssemMate采用图结构知识表示，结合自监督GCN编码知识图谱，并与LLM表示对齐，同时引入视觉增强策略处理堆叠场景。

Result: AssemMate在准确率上提升6.4%，推理速度快3倍，上下文长度缩短28倍，并在随机图谱上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AssemMate通过图结构知识表示和视觉增强策略，显著提升了机器人装配任务的效率和精确性，适用于模拟和真实场景。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based robotic assembly assistance has gained
significant research attention. It requires the injection of domain-specific
knowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction
with humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the
form of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content,
they struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise
reasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes
the graph\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge
representation\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge
graph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and
assembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate
also supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with
assembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
encodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns
them with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph
information. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address
stacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate
outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster
inference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong
generalization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates
superiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and
real-world settings. More details can be found on the project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本适应策略，使扩散策略能在推理时无需重新训练即可适应新机械臂和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散策略在训练未见机械臂或任务时泛化能力不足的问题，避免昂贵的数据重收集和策略重训练。

Method: 在SE(3)空间中训练基础扩散策略，通过在线投影适应新硬件和任务约束。

Result: 在多种机械臂和任务中验证了高成功率，如Franka Panda和Kuka iiwa 14。

Conclusion: 提出的适应投影策略有效且实用，适用于跨机械臂场景。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are powerful visuomotor models for robotic manipulation,
yet they often fail to generalize to manipulators or end-effectors unseen
during training and struggle to accommodate new task requirements at inference
time. Addressing this typically requires costly data recollection and policy
retraining for each new hardware or task configuration. To overcome this, we
introduce an adaptation-projection strategy that enables a diffusion policy to
perform zero-shot adaptation to novel manipulators and dynamic task settings,
entirely at inference time and without any retraining. Our method first trains
a diffusion policy in SE(3) space using demonstrations from a base manipulator.
During online deployment, it projects the policy's generated trajectories to
satisfy the kinematic and task-specific constraints imposed by the new hardware
and objectives. Moreover, this projection dynamically adapts to physical
differences (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) and task requirements
(e.g., obstacle heights), ensuring robust and successful execution. We validate
our approach on real-world pick-and-place, pushing, and pouring tasks across
multiple manipulators, including the Franka Panda and Kuka iiwa 14, equipped
with a diverse array of end-effectors like flexible grippers, Robotiq 2F/3F
grippers, and various 3D-printed designs. Our results demonstrate consistently
high success rates in these cross-manipulator scenarios, proving the
effectiveness and practicality of our adaptation-projection strategy. The code
will be released after peer review.

<details>

Motivation: 现实部署中，多问题异步到达且具有不同紧急程度，传统EQA无法满足需求。

Method: ParaEQsA框架包含共享记忆模块和优先级规划模块，并提出了PAEQs基准和NUWL、DAR指标。

Result: ParaEQsA在效率和响应性上优于基线，减少了探索和延迟。

Conclusion: 紧急感知的并行调度是实现高效、响应性强的具身代理的关键。

Abstract: This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem,
introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the
problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as
answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real
deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive
asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as
Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for
parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group
memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a
priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this
setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)
benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in
total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We
further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and
Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency
and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong
sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing
exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative
contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,
and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results
demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied
agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.

Conclusion: 该框架提高了数据效率、可解释性，为机器人控制提供了更鲁棒和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The control of robotic systems in complex, shared collaborative workspaces
presents significant challenges in achieving robust performance and safety when
learning from experienced or simulated data is employed in the pipeline. A
primary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads
to profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions
across different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to
rediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,
artificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper
introduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced
multibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a
Data-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form
Newton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for
tensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition
of the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an
uncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port
variable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling,
control, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the
structurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface,
proven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are
validated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for
data-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant
learning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction. The synergy directly
addresses the data-inefficiency problem, increases explainability and
interpretability, and paves the way for more robust and generalizable robotic
control in interactive environments.

Abstract: Autonomous stocking in retail environments, particularly supermarkets,
presents challenges due to dynamic human interactions, constrained spaces, and
diverse product geometries. This paper introduces an efficient end-to-end
robotic system for autonomous shelf stocking and fronting, integrating
commercially available hardware with a scalable algorithmic architecture. A
major contribution of this work is the system integration of off-the-shelf
hardware and ROS2-based perception, planning, and control into a single
deployable platform for retail environments. Our solution leverages Behavior
Trees (BTs) for task planning, fine-tuned vision models for object detection,
and a two-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for precise shelf
navigation using ArUco markers. Laboratory experiments replicating realistic
supermarket conditions demonstrate reliable performance, achieving over 98%
success in pick-and-place operations across a total of more than 700 stocking
events. However, our comparative benchmarks indicate that the performance and
cost-effectiveness of current autonomous systems remain inferior to that of
human workers, which we use to highlight key improvement areas and quantify the
progress still required before widespread commercial deployment can
realistically be achieved.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合OSM先验和自适应LiDAR扫描的框架，以提高复杂环境中的定位鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OSM提供轻量级全局先验，但常不完整或过时；LiDAR的固定扫描方式浪费资源且降低定位精度。

Method: 结合OSM先验和局部可观测性预测，通过不确定性感知的模型预测控制自适应分配扫描资源。

Result: 在校园、室内和城市环境中显著降低了轨迹误差，同时保持扫描完整性。

Conclusion: 开源地图与自适应LiDAR扫描结合，可在复杂环境中实现高效鲁棒的定位。

Abstract: LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap (OSM) localization has gained increasing attention, as
OSM provides lightweight global priors such as building footprints. These
priors enhance global consistency for robot navigation, but OSM is often
incomplete or outdated, limiting its reliability in real-world deployment.
Meanwhile, LiDAR itself suffers from a limited field of view (FoV), where
motorized rotation is commonly used to achieve panoramic coverage. Existing
motorized LiDAR systems, however, typically employ constant-speed scanning that
disregards both scene structure and map priors, leading to wasted effort in
feature-sparse regions and degraded localization accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework
that integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve
localization robustness. Specifically, we augment uncertainty-aware model
predictive control with an OSM-aware term that adaptively allocates scanning
effort according to both scene-dependent observability and the spatial
distribution of OSM features. The method is implemented in ROS with a motorized
LiDAR odometry backend and evaluated in both simulation and real-world
experiments. Results on campus roads, indoor corridors, and urban environments
demonstrate significant reductions in trajectory error compared to
constant-speed baselines, while maintaining scan completeness. These findings
highlight the potential of coupling open-source maps with adaptive LiDAR
scanning to achieve robust and efficient localization in complex environments.

Conclusion: WALL-OSS为从视觉语言模型到具身基础模型提供了可靠且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: While foundation models show remarkable progress in language and vision,
existing vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited spatial and
embodiment understanding. Transferring VLMs to embodied domains reveals
fundamental mismatches between modalities, pretraining distributions, and
training objectives, leaving action comprehension and generation as a central
bottleneck on the path to AGI.
  We introduce WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model that leverages
large-scale multimodal pretraining to achieve (1) embodiment-aware
vision-language understanding, (2) strong language-action association, and (3)
robust manipulation capability.
  Our approach employs a tightly coupled architecture and multi-strategies
training curriculum that enables Unified Cross-Level CoT-seamlessly unifying
instruction reasoning, subgoal decomposition, and fine-grained action synthesis
within a single differentiable framework.
  Our results show that WALL-OSS attains high success on complex long-horizon
manipulations, demonstrates strong instruction-following capabilities, complex
understanding and reasoning, and outperforms strong baselines, thereby
providing a reliable and scalable path from VLMs to embodied foundation models.

Conclusion: 该系统推动了直观遥操作、AR界面设计和工业环境感知的发展，并为机器学习提供训练数据。

Abstract: Traditional industrial robot programming is often complex and time-consuming,
typically requiring weeks or even months of effort from expert programmers.
Although Programming by Demonstration (PbD) offers a more accessible
alternative, intuitive interfaces for robot control and demonstration
collection remain challenging. To address this, we propose an Augmented Reality
(AR)-enhanced robot teleoperation system that integrates AR-based control with
spatial point cloud rendering, enabling intuitive, contact-free demonstrations.
This approach allows operators to control robots remotely without entering the
workspace or using conventional tools like the teach pendant. The proposed
system is generally applicable and has been demonstrated on ABB robot
platforms, specifically validated with the IRB 1200 industrial robot and the
GoFa 5 collaborative robot. A user study evaluates the impact of real-time
environmental perception, specifically with and without point cloud rendering,
on task completion accuracy, efficiency, and user confidence. Results indicate
that enhanced perception significantly improves task performance by 28% and
enhances user experience, as reflected by a 12% increase in the System
Usability Scale (SUS) score. This work contributes to the advancement of
intuitive robot teleoperation, AR interface design, environmental perception,
and teleoperation safety mechanisms in industrial settings for demonstration
collection. The collected demonstrations may serve as valuable training data
for machine learning applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the performance of visual navigation policies
trained in simulation compares to policies trained with real-world data.
Performance degradation of simulator-trained policies is often significant when
they are evaluated in the real world. However, despite this well-known
sim-to-real gap, we demonstrate that simulator-trained policies can match the
performance of their real-world-trained counterparts.
  Central to our approach is a navigation policy architecture that bridges the
sim-to-real appearance gap by leveraging pretrained visual representations and
runs real-time on robot hardware. Evaluations on a wheeled mobile robot show
that the proposed policy, when trained in simulation, outperforms its
real-world-trained version by 31% and the prior state-of-the-art methods by 50%
in navigation success rate. Policy generalization is verified by deploying the
same model onboard a drone.
  Our results highlight the importance of diverse image encoder pretraining for
sim-to-real generalization, and identify on-policy learning as a key advantage
of simulated training over training with real data.

Conclusion: Koopman建模能有效结合现代学习方法和经典控制理论，KORR展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory. For more details, please

Abstract: Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic
manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment
learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect
stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on
heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight
diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview
RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps
disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time
encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed
boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and
learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves
an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong
performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline
policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate
data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating
the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for
further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning
policies.

Conclusion: VHD通过动态调整视野，显著提升了扩散规划器的性能和鲁棒性，且无需改变架构或在线训练。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their
robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing
planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and
inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are
too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying
geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable
Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned
variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first
predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model,
which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired
length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by
controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on
randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes.
Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation
and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon
mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂户外环境中的不确定性挑战，提升了语义映射的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Semantic mapping aims to construct a 3D semantic representation of the
environment, providing essential knowledge for robots operating in complex
outdoor settings. While Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) addresses
discontinuities of map inference from sparse sensor data, existing semantic
mapping methods suffer from various sources of uncertainties in challenging
outdoor environments. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware
semantic mapping framework that handles multiple sources of uncertainties,
which significantly degrade mapping performance. Our method estimates
uncertainties in semantic predictions using Evidential Deep Learning and
incorporates them into BKI for robust semantic inference. It further aggregates
noisy observations into coherent Gaussian representations to mitigate the
impact of unreliable points, while employing geometry-aligned kernels that
adapt to complex scene structures. These Gaussian primitives effectively fuse
local geometric and semantic information, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware
mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse
off-road and urban outdoor environments demonstrates consistent improvements in
mapping quality, uncertainty calibration, representational flexibility, and

Abstract: Simulating hostile attacks of physical autonomous systems can be a useful
tool to examine their robustness to attack and inform vulnerability-aware
design. In this work, we examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol,
by presenting a machine learning-based adversary model that observes robot
patrol behavior in order to attempt to gain undetected access to a secure
environment within a limited time duration. Such a model allows for evaluation
of a patrol system against a realistic potential adversary, offering insight
into future patrol strategy design. We show that our new model outperforms
existing baselines, thus providing a more stringent test, and examine its
performance against multiple leading decentralized multi-robot patrol
strategies.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly prevalent in both homes and industrial
settings, the demand for intuitive and efficient human-machine interaction
continues to rise. Gesture recognition offers an intuitive control method that
does not require physical contact with devices and can be implemented using
various sensing technologies. Wireless solutions are particularly flexible and
minimally invasive. While camera-based vision systems are commonly used, they
often raise privacy concerns and can struggle in complex or poorly lit
environments. In contrast, radar sensing preserves privacy, is robust to
occlusions and lighting, and provides rich spatial data such as distance,
relative velocity, and angle. We present a gesture-controlled robotic arm using
mm-wave radar for reliable, contactless motion recognition. Nine gestures are
recognized and mapped to real-time commands with precision. Case studies are
conducted to demonstrate the system practicality, performance and reliability
for gesture-based robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work that treats gesture
recognition and robotic control separately, our system unifies both into a
real-time pipeline for seamless, contactless human-robot interaction.

TL;DR: NavFoM是一个跨任务和跨实体的导航基础模型，通过统一架构处理多模态输入，在多种导航任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在导航任务中的泛化能力有限，NavFoM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: NavFoM采用统一架构，结合标识符令牌处理不同相机配置和时间范围，并动态调整采样策略。

Result: NavFoM在多个公共基准测试中达到或接近最优性能，无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: NavFoM展示了强大的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the
intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments
following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance
on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied
navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and
embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a
cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained
on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled
robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language
navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM
employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from
varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse
camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that
embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks.
Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all
observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a
limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive
performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm
the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our
approach.
