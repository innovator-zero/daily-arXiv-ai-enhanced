This thesis presents a\nreal-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in\nshared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset\nuser to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,\nensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.\nRemoval is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,\nfollowed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,\nimplemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be\nportable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D\nscanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection\nand a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for\nhigh-quality video inpainting.

Unlike conventional part\nsegmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns\nto produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object\narticulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part\nsegmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different\npart counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks\nto continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to\nshare the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to\nbe recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion\nFusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a\ncontrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of\npart predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted\nto 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few\nmanual adjustments.

Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first\nprinciples and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part\nof this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a\nfunction that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce\nsparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly\ninteresting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression\n(MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple\ndatasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common\nproblems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations\nadded support to MvSR with small differences between them.

Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models\nthat rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new\nsurgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in\nprompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot\nsegmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these\nmodels on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in\nintroperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative\nperception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support\non-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and\nanatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a\ncollaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated\nsegmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to\nguide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine\ncollaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive\npointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our\nproposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an\nin-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate\non-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene.

Cross-validation prediction accuracies\nranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),\n0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,\nprecision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more\nwidely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr\npipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This\nframework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable\nprediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing\nreliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers.

Existing approaches\noften suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder\ngeneralization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing\nlong-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time\nnavigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied\nfoundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first\nconstruct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought\n(CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with\nstructured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based\nreinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format,\nunderstanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic\ngrounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow\nreasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency\nreactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations\non embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation\nperformance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its\nrobustness under limited onboard resources. Code:\nhttps://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

Crucially, the architecture can maintain sub-20ms latency\nacross orders-of-magnitude variations in node number (to thousands of nodes).\nBy fundamentally redefining signal encoding paradigms in soft electronics, this\nwork opens new frontiers in developing scalable embodied intelligent systems\nwith human-like sensory capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e03\u7ebf\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ae\u80a4\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u67d4\u6027\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e03\u7ebf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7801\u5206\u591a\u5740\uff08CDMA\uff09\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u8282\u70b9\u4f20\u611f\u9635\u5217\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u6839\u4f20\u8f93\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b012.8\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5343\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4e9a20\u6beb\u79d2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u5b98\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks\nthat can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations.\nAmong these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated\nexploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and\nmanipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only\nexisting intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the\nchallenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks\nin robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework,\nViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a\nvision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's\nauthority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes\nSAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate\nmaps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models\nnominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A\nframe-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an\nonline detector with interpretable thresholds.

In this\npaper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise\nprediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future\nFLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic\ntumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing\nuncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution\nacross arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that\nmodels inter-scan changes using deformation fields.

Based on merely two follow-up\nscans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending\nprobability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at\nany future temporal milestone.

The main\nobstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view\nimagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization\nof existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban\nenvironments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To\naddress these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary\nsemantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates\nwithout aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation\nnetworks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic\nfeatures directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity\nrendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced\nfusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables\nzero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic\nrichness and geometric priors.

Moreover, existing approaches often\nrely on simplified robot models or focus primarily on obstacle representation,\nwhich can lead to incomplete collision detection and degraded performance in\ncluttered scenes. To address these limitations, we propose spatial anchor-based\nmotion policy (SAMP), a unified framework that simultaneously encodes the\nenvironment and the manipulator using signed distance field (SDF) anchored on a\nshared spatial grid. SAMP incorporates a dedicated robot SDF network that\ncaptures the manipulator's precise geometry, enabling collision-aware reasoning\nbeyond coarse link approximations.

We further demonstrate that training a\nrecognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than\n20\\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with\nTrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.\nOur findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which\nnot only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides\na valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone\nrecognition and generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrueSkin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u80a4\u8272\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u76847299\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u80a4\u8272\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u751f\u6210AI\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TrueSkin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b6\u7c7b7299\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528TrueSkin\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80a4\u8272\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "TrueSkin\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u80a4\u8272\u4efb\u52a1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE/ASME T-MECH. Code available at\n  https://github.com/ChenzycBIT/CORB-planner", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in a large number of robotic\ncontrol tasks. Nevertheless, its deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nremains challenging, mainly because of reliance on accurate dynamic models and\nplatform-specific sensing, which hinders cross-platform transfer. This paper\npresents the CORB-Planner (Corridor-as-Observations for RL B-spline planner), a\nreal-time, RL-based trajectory planning framework for high-speed autonomous UAV\nflight across heterogeneous platforms. The key idea is to combine B-spline\ntrajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points\nwith a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic\nsearch. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form,\nmitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to\nmodel inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard\nprogressive training pipeline in simulation.

Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and\nsparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective\nretention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.\nThis approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability\nby identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.\nTheoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to\nrecover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.\nEmpirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public\nhistopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3acsMIL\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e22\u5f03\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "csMIL\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u7c07\u5185\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7c07\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7c07\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793acsMIL\u7b26\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728CAMELYON16\u548cTCGA-NSCLC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "csMIL\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model,\ncompute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a\ngeometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy\n(ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live\nimage for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete\nset of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on\na weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy,\nand then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated\npose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field\nof view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy\ntrained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that\npreserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity.

While the\nhuman brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with\n\"catastrophic forgetting,\" where learning new tasks erases previously acquired\nknowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion\nmodels, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models\nface \"mode collapse,\" where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over\ntime. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a\nneuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models.

While previous quantum RL models focused on smaller environments,\nsuch as wheeled robots and robotic arms, our work pioneers the application of\nQDRL to humanoid robotics, specifically in environments with substantial\nobservation and action spaces, such as MuJoCo's Humanoid-v4 and Walker2d-v4.\nUsing parameterized quantum circuits, we explored a hybrid quantum-classical\nsetup to directly navigate high-dimensional state spaces, bypassing traditional\nmapping and planning. By integrating quantum computing with deep RL, we aim to\ndevelop models that can efficiently learn complex navigation tasks in humanoid\nrobots. We evaluated the performance of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in\nclassical RL against its quantum implementation. The results show that the\nquantum SAC achieves an 8% higher average return (246.40) than the classical\nSAC (228.36) after 92% fewer steps, highlighting the accelerated learning\npotential of quantum computing in RL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QDRL\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50SAC\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178SAC\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u9ad88%\uff08246.40 vs 228.36\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u6b65\u9aa4\u51cf\u5c1192%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

End-to-end learning offers a unified framework\nby directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches\nlack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that\ntransformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable\nand temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability\nof downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an\nend-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the\nlearning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)\nmechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a\nself-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs\ninstead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to\nfocus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather\nthan merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more\nrobust and generalizable policy.

In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like\nneural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly\nspecialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are\nknown to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality\n(Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even\nminimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for\ntraining a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method\nenables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide\nvariety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg\nthat also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs.\nrigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller\n(PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy\nwith only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide\nvariety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made\npossible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained\nthrough a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000\nquadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement\nLearning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive\nstudent policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation\npolicy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the\ncapabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory\ntracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).", "AI": {"tldr": "RAPTOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u73af\u5883\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982Sim2Real\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec31000\u4e2a\u6559\u5e08\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u751f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u97002084\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "RAPTOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in real-world\nscenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor\nfailures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'\noperation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to\nreconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote\nsensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first\nexamine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the\nheterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture\nsemantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class\nvariation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy\ndependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model\nrobustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we\npropose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with\nthree key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn\nmodality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness\n(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)\nComplementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by\nencouraging consistency across modalities and tasks.

In this paper, we\npresent a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for the shape control of\nsimulated multi-segment tendon-driven soft continuum robots with the Kirchhoff\nrod model. Using data collected from these simulated soft robots, we conduct a\nper-segment projection scheme on the state of the robots allowing for the\nidentification of control-affine Koopman models that are an order of magnitude\nmore accurate than without the projection scheme. Using these learned Koopman\nmodels, we use a linear model predictive control (MPC) to control the robots to\na collection of target shapes of varying complexity. Our method realizes\ncomputationally efficient closed-loop control, and demonstrates the feasibility\nof real-time shape control for soft robots.

Lara"], "title": "Interpretable neural network system identification method for two families of second-order systems based on characteristic curves", "comment": null, "summary": "Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off\nbetween interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of\nphysical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines\nthe mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the\nflexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the\nconcept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear\nfunctions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results\nshow that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple\npolynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator.

To evaluate this\nsetting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)\nbenchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in\ntotal), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We\nfurther propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and\nNormalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency\nand responsiveness of this system.

A\nprimary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads\nto profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions\nacross different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to\nrediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,\nartificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced\nmultibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a\nData-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form\nNewton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for\ntensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition\nof the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an\nuncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port\nvariable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling,\ncontrol, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the\nstructurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface,\nproven via Lyapunov analysis.

The most common way of representing skin\ntone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has\nbeen criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for\nlighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the\ngranularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the\nquestion marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the\nFST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in\nfair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better\nrepresents the diversity of human skin tones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Fitzpatrick\u76ae\u80a4\u8272\u8c03\uff08FST\uff09\u91cf\u8868\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9AI\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FST\u5206\u7ec4\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u516c\u5e73AI\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u4ee3\u8868\u80a4\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u91cf\u8868\u3002", "motivation": "FST\u91cf\u8868\u5728\u80a4\u8272\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6d45\u80a4\u8272\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cdAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2aAI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684FST\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u826f\u6027vs.\u6076\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u7ec4FST\u6570\u636e\uff08FST 1/2, 3/4, 5/6\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u51cf\u5c11FST\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5408\u5e761/2\u548c3/4\uff09\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FST\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u516c\u5e73AI\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u4ee3\u8868\u80a4\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u91cf\u8868\u3002"}}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework\nthat integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve\nlocalization robustness. Specifically, we augment uncertainty-aware model\npredictive control with an OSM-aware term that adaptively allocates scanning\neffort according to both scene-dependent observability and the spatial\ndistribution of OSM features. The method is implemented in ROS with a motorized\nLiDAR odometry backend and evaluated in both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. Results on campus roads, indoor corridors, and urban environments\ndemonstrate significant reductions in trajectory error compared to\nconstant-speed baselines, while maintaining scan completeness.

We consider a standard parametric form for\nbid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint\ndistribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter\ndistribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a\ndata-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the\ncontext, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,\ndevice, or location.

The proposed design not only\nreduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures\nthat the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.\nOur theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with\nexperiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages\nof the approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The key to solving this problem lies in\navoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes\nduring continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works\ncumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store\nand utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid\ncatastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between\nclasses shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will\ncontinuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in\nknowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve\ndomain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.\nSpecifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we\nname as \"attribute\". In our framework, we learn a \"key-value\" pair to represent\nan attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value\nis the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each\ncorresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across\ndomains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention\nconsistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and\ncross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting\nwhile mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on\nthree CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.\nCode is available at https://github.com/RyunMi/VisTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08CI-UDA\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u957f\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCI-UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5b58\u50a8\u5386\u53f2\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5171\u4eab\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u201d\u8868\u793a\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u952e\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u503c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u3002\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e24\u4e2a\u57df\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aCI-UDA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

By\nanalyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under\nchanges in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic\nstability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying\nunstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is\ncomputationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the\nmodel's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural\nnetworks.

Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on\npreference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models\nfor preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable\nimprovement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the\ntarget LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a\npair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection\nprocess, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key\nobservations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination\npatterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination\nmitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training\nstrategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the\npreference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous\nenhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that\nAPASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models\nbut also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based\nmethods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and\ngeneralization capability.

Models frequently enabled\nharmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\\pm$0.84) and offered safety\ninterventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37\n$\\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.\nPerformance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more\nlikely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions\n(p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).\nModel performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent\nproperty of scale alone.\n  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk\nand underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame\nthis issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health\nimperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and\nhealthcare professionals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6216\u8bf1\u53d1\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9690\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u201cAI\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u201d\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316LLM\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7psychosis-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e868\u79cdLLM\u572816\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u5984\u60f3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5984\u60f3\u786e\u8ba4\u3001\u5371\u5bb3\u4fc3\u6210\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709LLM\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5fc3\u7406\u81f4\u75c5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9690\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u6613\u786e\u8ba4\u5984\u60f3\u548c\u4fc3\u6210\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03LLM\u5fc3\u7406\u81f4\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u9700\u5f15\u8d77\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that\nleverages quaternion averaging.

However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,\nhigh-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios.

This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online\nstore) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model\nupdates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby\npreserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing\nFL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,\ndespite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to\nenrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this\nend, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform\ncollaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender\nsystem. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item\nlists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or\nlocally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of\nsparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional\nchallenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and\nirrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational\ncosts. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively\naugments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the\nglobal dataset.

These challenges\nare even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class\nIncremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually\nadapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial\ncomputational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work\nintroduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach\nthat addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable\nsolution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several\nexisting, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature\nextractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer\nneural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone.

In this regime, we show that for each\niteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic\nvector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can\nbe tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two\nscalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of\ndesign matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic\nconvergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient\ndescent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and\nstrongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as\nthe `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models\nunder Gaussian data.\n  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two\napplications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we\nprove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent\ninitialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish\nuniversality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for\nlarge aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm\nfor estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent\ntrajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for\npractical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.\n  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio\nregime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line\nof dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time\nhorizon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u975e\u51f8\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8f68\u8ff9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u51f8\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\u533a\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u7406\u8bba\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fed\u4ee3\u5728\u5927\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\u533a\u57df\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u4e0d\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5982\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u786e\u5b9a\u3002"}}

The\nverification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference\ncosts), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference\nwhile maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.\nOur codes have been released in Github:\n\\textbf{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion}", "AI": {"tldr": "SpeCa\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684'\u9884\u6d4b-\u9a8c\u8bc1'\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Speculative Sampling\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "method": "SpeCa\u91c7\u7528Speculative Sampling\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSpeCa\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866.34x\u81f37.3x\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6781\u5c0f\uff085.5%\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u4e3a1.67%-3.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "SpeCa\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted\nFocal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address\nclass imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented\ncategories.

While crucial for modality fusion,\nthe potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct\nimpact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two\ncomplementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the\nlatent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information\npreservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between\nimage representations, before and after projection.

Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the\nLDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images\nresembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in\nreconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The\nresults highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms\nfor large models in SI scenarios.

The predicted landmarks\nenable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these\nmethods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently\nfail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both\nmother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining\nannotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data\naugmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly\ngeneralize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from\nolder GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation\nstrategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal\npositioning of early GAs.

The\ngoal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a\nfew annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by\ntraining from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with\nthese approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and\nvideo segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot\nsegmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities\nare directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images\ntypically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames\nused in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of\nparameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from\nits impressive segmentation performance.

Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a\ntabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies\nwith the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often\nneglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation\ndimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model\nperformance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as\nquantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to\nground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world\ndatasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly\nconsiders structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We\nintroduce a new evaluation metric, $\\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the\nassessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal\nstructures. In addition, we present $\\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular\ngenerators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic\nlens for tabular generator performance.

An\nauthoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,\nhighlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based\ninformation retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.", "AI": {"tldr": "MillStone\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5916\u90e8\u8bba\u70b9\u5bf9LLM\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7acb\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u666e\u904d\u5f00\u653e\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u6743\u5a01\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u907f\u514dLLM\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528MillStone\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e5d\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u5bf9\u7acb\u8bba\u70b9\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u8bba\u70b9\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4e89\u8bae\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4f46\u6743\u5a01\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u6613\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u7acb\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9632\u6b62LLM\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002"}}

That raises a\nquestion on the possibility of analyzing scientific publishing data (e.g.\ncitation networks) leading up to a bubble for signals that may forecast the\nrise and fall of similar future bubbles. To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs\nto detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of\nscientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting\ntechnology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024.\nResults showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a\nbubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble.

Upon\nfurther analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH),\nthe data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form\nof financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists.

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion.

Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions.

Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round\nworkflows with simultaneous move and scale operations.

Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm", "comment": null, "summary": "Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks\ndue to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal\ndecision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization\ntask. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is\nNP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper\ndecision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four\nformal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four\ngeneric algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees\nsatisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties\nof hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial\nhypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.\n  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the\nalgorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the\nfirst hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to\nhyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on\ngeneral-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general\nhypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.\n  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision\ntrees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature\nnoise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more\naccurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.\nWe also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,\nshowing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree\ncomplexity is properly controlled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff08HODT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08HODT\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cHODT\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u6811\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u572830\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cHODT\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa30%\u3002", "conclusion": "HODT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An ensemble combining Random\nForest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at\n585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected).

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08prime attention\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u7684token\u8868\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u5bf9token\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cprime attention\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe6.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1140%\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "prime attention\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002"}}

While various\ntechniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is\ndesigning an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement.\nCurrent options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on\nresource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating\nimages at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training.\nThis study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature\nEnrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to\ncreate a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective\nskipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution\nimages than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and\ntransform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent\nfull-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nLEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate\nvariable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative\nperformance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to\nother methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models.\nOur code and project page are available at\nhttps://jegzheng.github.io/LEGODiffusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEGO bricks\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5185\u5bb9\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u5806\u53e0\u6210\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u53d8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5982U-Net\u548cVision Transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u53d8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEGO bricks\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MLP\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7528Transformer\u5757\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aLEGO\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u53d8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "LEGO\u662f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}
