*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人机协同的机器学习方法，用于提高3D解剖结构分割的泛化能力，并在乳腺癌MRI数据上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法在多样化数据集上的泛化能力不足，影响了术前规划的准确性。

Method: 使用U-Mamba模型结合人机协同方法，对120例乳腺癌MRI进行匿名化、手动分割、配准和3D可视化。

Result: U-Mamba在T1加权图像上表现出色（DSC值0.97-0.82），3D重建结果提升了临床规划和患者教育效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提高了算法的泛化能力，为临床决策和患者教育提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）自动分割TRISO颗粒的显微图像，以减少人工分析的主观性和工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动分析方法耗时且主观，需要自动化工具来提高效率和客观性。

Method: 生成包含2000多张TRISO颗粒显微图像的数据集，并使用RU-Net、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN模型进行自动分割。

Result: RU-Net模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，显著提高了分割效率和客观性。

Conclusion: CNN模型能够加速TRISO颗粒的分析过程，减少人工干预并提高结果的可靠性。

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

### [3] [Modular, On-Site Solutions with Lightweight Anomaly Detection for Sustainable Nutrient Management in Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12247)
*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层管道，用于高效检测作物异常和状态估计，结合了自动编码器和不同复杂度的模块，平衡了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法耗时且计算密集，无法实时优化作物管理，需要一种灵活且高效的方法。

Method: 使用自动编码器进行异常检测，并比较了基于植被指数的随机森林和基于深度学习的Vision Transformer进行状态估计。

Result: 高效检测异常（73%检出率），ViT在磷和钙估计上优于RF，但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 模块化管道为农业可持续性提供了边缘诊断和实用机会。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）理解多模态幽默和叙事序列的能力。实验显示当前模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解幽默是社交智能的核心，但目前的大型多模态模型在这方面存在显著挑战。

Method: 通过PixelHumor数据集评估LMMs在多模态幽默理解和叙事序列识别上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，顶级模型在面板排序任务中仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了严格框架，旨在推动LMMs在自然、社交互动中的发展。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线人-物交互（HOI）生成与感知框架OnlineHOI，基于Mamba架构和记忆机制，解决了离线方法在在线场景中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOI方法多为离线设置，无法适应实时场景中仅依赖当前和历史数据的在线需求。

Method: 提出OnlineHOI框架，结合Mamba的流数据处理能力和记忆机制的历史信息整合。

Result: 在Core4D、OAKINK2生成任务和HOI4D感知任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OnlineHOI框架有效解决了在线HOI任务，展示了在实时场景中的潜力。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 深度学习技术（如Deepfake）在带来便利的同时，也对社会产生了负面影响，包括隐私侵犯、名誉损害和国家安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术（尤其是Deepfake）在社会中的应用及其带来的双重影响，强调其潜在风险。

Method: 通过分析Deepfake技术的应用场景和实际案例，揭示其对隐私、政治和经济结构的危害。

Result: Deepfake技术可能导致虚假信息泛滥，影响公众认知，甚至威胁国家安全。

Conclusion: 需要加强对Deepfake技术的监管和防范措施，以减轻其对社会的不良影响。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏差（SB）与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了一种新的频率感知测量方法，并探讨了SB与不同任务性能的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，对大型模型中的SB测量及其在图像分类任务中的影响了解不足。

Method: 提出频率感知的SB测量方法，并在CLIP模型上验证其有效性；分析SB与多种图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新测量方法更有效；SB强度与任务性能相关，例如更强的SB有助于OOD泛化但不利于对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 模型的归纳偏差应与目标任务特性对齐，SB的调控需根据任务需求调整。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

### [8] [GraphDerm: Fusing Imaging, Physical Scale, and Metadata in a Population-Graph Classifier for Dermoscopic Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12277)
*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm结合图像、毫米级校准和元数据，通过图神经网络提升皮肤镜分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AI仅依赖图像而忽略患者元数据和几何尺度的问题。

Method: 使用U-Net分割病变和标尺，回归像素-毫米比例，构建图神经网络进行半监督分类。

Result: AUC达0.9812，稀疏图仍保持高精度（0.9788），优于仅图像基线（0.9440）。

Conclusion: 结合尺度、几何和元数据的图方法显著优于传统方法，稀疏图部署高效。

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了位置感知的文本图像机器翻译（PATIMT），支持细粒度和保留布局的翻译，并构建了PATIMTBench基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TIMT研究忽略了提供边界框和覆盖有限场景，PATIMT旨在解决这些问题，具有实际应用价值。

Method: 提出自适应图像OCR细化流程，构建PATIMTBench数据集，并微调大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）。

Result: 微调后的LVLMs在两个子任务上达到最先进性能，实验证明了训练数据的可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务和PATIMTBench数据集为细粒度、布局保留的文本图像翻译提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

### [10] [Domain Adaptive SAR Wake Detection: Leveraging Similarity Filtering and Memory Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12279)
*He Gao,Baoxiang Huang,Milena Radenkovic,Borui Li,Ge Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SimMemDA的无监督域自适应框架，通过实例级特征相似性过滤和特征记忆引导，解决光学与SAR图像间的跨模态域适应问题，提升船舶尾迹检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像因其复杂的成像机制导致尾迹特征抽象且噪声多，标注困难；而光学图像虽视觉线索清晰，但直接训练的模型在SAR图像上性能下降。

Method: 利用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制减少负迁移，引入特征置信记忆库动态校准目标域伪标签，并通过区域混合训练增强泛化。

Result: 实验表明SimMemDA能显著提升跨模态船舶尾迹检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SimMemDA框架有效解决了光学与SAR图像间的域适应问题，验证了方法的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all- weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adap- tation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like dis- tributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature- Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated tar- get pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

### [11] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动、物理引导的深度学习方法，用于生成美国本土每小时2公里分辨率的空气温度数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据源（如气象站和卫星）无法提供无缝的时空数据，因此需要一种新方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，通过神经网络重建被云层遮挡的GOES-16地表温度数据，并利用ERA5温度值和卷积层捕捉时空变化，再通过另一神经网络将地表温度转换为空气温度。

Result: 在77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站记录上测试，验证了每小时空气温度映射的准确性为1.93°C。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高时空分辨率下的无缝空气温度监测，并可扩展到其他卫星数据源。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS@GT团队在AnimalCLEF 2025重识别挑战中的研究发现，后处理度量学习的效果高度依赖于初始嵌入的质量和领域特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用模型与领域特定模型在细粒度任务中的表现差异，以及后处理度量学习的有效性。

Method: 比较DINOv2（通用模型）和MegaDescriptor（领域特定模型）作为主干网络，结合KNN分类器和三元组学习投影头。

Result: 领域特定模型性能提升显著（0.13分），而通用模型提升有限（0.03分），验证损失和可视化表明通用模型难以适应细粒度任务。

Conclusion: 强调领域特定预训练的重要性，通用模型在有限数据任务中优化效果有限。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

### [13] [GhostNetV3-Small: A Tailored Architecture and Comparative Study of Distillation Strategies for Tiny Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12380)
*Florian Zager,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GhostNetV3-Small，针对低分辨率输入优化，在CIFAR-10上表现优于原版GhostNetV3，但知识蒸馏技术效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的边缘设备上部署困难，需探索模型压缩和适应策略。

Method: 提出GhostNetV3-Small架构，并比较多种知识蒸馏技术（传统蒸馏、教师助理、教师集成）。

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上准确率达93.94%，但蒸馏策略均降低准确率。

Conclusion: 架构优化比蒸馏对小规模图像分类任务更有效，需进一步研究模型设计和蒸馏技术。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MechBench数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从几何结构中学习机械组件的耦合运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从几何结构中推断机械组件（如齿轮）的耦合运动，因为它们依赖简化运动结构或关节标注。

Method: 提出了MechBench数据集（693个合成齿轮组件）和DYNAMO模型（依赖感知神经网络），直接从分割的CAD点云预测每部分的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: DYNAMO在实验中优于基线方法，实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO为CAD组件中耦合运动的数据驱动学习提供了系统性框架。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 棉花采摘依赖人工，效率低且易错过最佳收获期，需准确识别棉花铃及其成熟度以实现自动化和产量估算。

Method: 基于YOLOv11n改进，引入NeLU增强的全局注意力机制和扩张感受野SPPF模块，提升空间表示和多尺度上下文建模能力。

Result: 在实验中达到91.5%精确率、89.8%召回率和93.3% mAP50，计算成本仅7.5 GFLOPs。

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Motivation: 青光眼是全球不可逆失明的主要原因之一，现有方法受限于固定长度输入和小规模数据集，影响了预后效果。

Method: TSDF分为两阶段：1）自监督学习的特征表示模块，整合多数据集；2）基于注意力的时序聚合模块，处理可变长度输入。

Result: 在OHTS和GRAPE两个数据集上验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: TSDF框架灵活高效，适用于不同规模和临床场景的青光眼预后任务。

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型的分词器仅关注重建任务，忽略了生成过程中的误差，导致重建与生成分布存在显著差异。

Method: 提出主训练（引入潜在扰动策略模拟生成噪声）和后训练（优化解码器以减少分布差异），并设计新评估指标pFID。

Result: 在约4亿参数的生成器上，主训练使gFID降至1.60，后训练进一步降至1.36，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方案通过改进分词器训练显著提升了生成质量，适用于离散和连续分词器及不同生成模型。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于Transformer的基础模型（GRT），用于提升低成本毫米波雷达的3D占用和语义分割性能，并展示了其泛化能力和数据扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达成本低、耐用且适应性强，但分辨率低。现有方法缺乏标准化基础模型和大数据集，限制了性能提升。

Method: 收集了最大的原始雷达数据集（1M样本），训练了GRT模型，支持3D占用和语义分割预测。

Result: GRT在多样场景中表现优异，数据扩展性为20%/10倍数据，且原始数据优于传统表示。

Conclusion: GRT展示了毫米波雷达的潜力，未来需更大数据集（约100M样本）以充分发挥其性能。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用控制扰动（如光照变化、运动模糊和压缩伪影）和多种评估指标（词汇和神经相似性）对模型进行测试。

Result: 实验发现，真实描述的清晰度、模型大小和特定噪声类型对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准，并揭示了模型设计中的关键权衡。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在对象边界定位和覆盖完整对象区域上的不足。

Method: 结合实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强三个创新点。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上达到82.3%的mIoU（后处理提升至86.6%），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设定了新基准，适用于像素级标注不可用或昂贵的场景。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Result: 在四个基准数据集和八种不同设置下的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签联邦学习场景中有效，解决了数据分布不均和标签复杂性的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Conclusion: Agent4FaceForgery框架有效解决了数据生态无效性问题，为伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在HOI检测中未显式建模关系结构，而图神经网络（GNNs）更适合此任务。

Method: 设计了一个多模态图网络框架，采用四阶段图结构，并引入多级特征交互机制。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准上取得最优性能，且在稀有和非稀有类别间保持平衡。

Conclusion: MGNM通过显式建模关系结构和多级特征交互，显著提升了HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in run-ning
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estima-tion. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than con-tinuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of in-put image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
im-proves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

*Yizhen Lao,Yu Zhang,Ziting Wang,Chengbo Wang,Yifei Xue,Wanpeng Shao*

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LiDAR定位的新型对抗攻击框架DisorientLiDAR，通过逆向工程定位模型并移除关键点，显著降低了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击主要针对3D感知，而LiDAR定位的安全性研究较少，存在严重安全隐患。

Method: 通过逆向工程定位模型识别关键点，并策略性移除这些点，攻击LiDAR定位系统。

Result: 在KITTI数据集和Autoware平台上验证了攻击的有效性，物理实验也成功复现了攻击效果。

Conclusion: DisorientLiDAR证明了LiDAR定位系统的脆弱性，为实际物理世界攻击提供了可行性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注图像域，忽略了反射光的光谱特性，导致反射去除效果不佳。

Result: 在三个反射基准测试中表现优于现有方法，展示了优越性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过光谱学习视角，新方法显著提升了反射去除的准确性和效果。

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗性鲁棒性蒸馏方法CIARD，通过多教师框架和连续对抗训练，显著提升了学生模型的鲁棒性和干净样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性鲁棒性蒸馏方法在提升学生模型鲁棒性的同时，会导致干净样本性能下降，原因是双教师模型的优化目标冲突和对抗样本迭代生成导致的教师模型性能退化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上，CIARD平均提升了3.53%的对抗防御率和5.87%的干净样本准确率。

Conclusion: CIARD在平衡模型鲁棒性和泛化性方面设立了新基准。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Motivation: 现有基准测试存在与真实世界操纵模式不符的对齐问题，论文旨在解决这一问题，检测语义一致的跨模态操纵。

Method: 通过两阶段流程构建SAMM数据集，并设计RamDG框架，利用外部知识库检索上下文证据辅助检测与定位。

Result: 实验表明，RamDG在SAMM数据集上的检测准确率比现有方法高2.06%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了多模态数据中语义协调操纵的检测问题，SAMM数据集和RamDG框架为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于EVA02的多尺度频率注意力融合方法（MFAF），用于跨视角地理定位任务，显著提升了特征表示的一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角地理定位任务中，由于视角变化导致的显著外观差异和特征提取困难，现有方法常忽略空间和语义信息。

Method: MFAF方法包含多频率分支块（MFB）和频率感知空间注意力模块（FSA），分别用于捕获多尺度频率特征和自适应聚焦关键区域。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上（如University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV）表现出色，适用于无人机定位和导航任务。

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过结合多尺度频率特征和注意力机制，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下图像因光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡带来的挑战，同时适应AUV有限的计算资源。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（珊瑚疾病和鱼类物种），在不同训练比例下评估YOLOv8至v11的性能指标。

Result: YOLOv9后精度提升有限，但速度显著提高；YOLOv10在速度和精度间表现最优。

Conclusion: YOLOv10适合AUV部署，研究提供了可复现的基准和代码库，推动海洋视觉研究。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Conclusion: StereoCarla为自动驾驶提供了更鲁棒的深度感知系统开发基准。

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under
realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth
perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Code can be available at

Result: 通过基准测试验证了数据集的实用性，为实际火灾场景的图像去雾提供了基础。

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集已公开，可推动真实场景中图像去雾算法的进步。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

Conclusion: RIS-FUSION通过联合优化实现了显著的性能提升，并提供了新的基准数据集。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)，结合解构-重构框架与去偏策略。

Result: 在三个数据集上，DeFA在封闭和开放世界设置中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DeFA通过合成高保真组合特征，有效提升组合零样本学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

Result: AsyMoE在准确率上比传统MoE和模态特定MoE分别提升26.58%和15.45%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: AsyMoE有效解决了跨模态不对称问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型依赖多视图扩散先验，易产生视图不一致性且难以表示复杂内部结构或非平凡拓扑。

Method: 通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为多层2D球形投影（SP）表示，SPGen在图像域操作，继承2D扩散先验并高效微调。

Result: SPGen在几何质量和计算效率上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SPGen通过SP表示解决了视图一致性和复杂结构表示问题，同时高效利用了2D扩散先验。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Result: 在四个VLMs和四个安全基准测试中，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中表现出色，优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为越狱VLMs提供了新视角，展示了防御模式在攻击中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到其他框架中，提升性能的同时减少模型大小。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Motivation: 研究深度可分离网络中学习到的滤波器是否可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器理想化建模，以提高网络的可解释性和效率。

Method: 首先计算滤波器的空间分布度量，然后基于高斯核的离散模拟建模滤波器，并通过两种方式拟合模型。

Conclusion: 深度可分离网络中的滤波器可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器有效近似，为网络设计提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估生成文本到图像模型的质量仍具挑战性，现有方法未深入探讨多模态LLMs如何利用人类相关概念（如风格或构图）进行评估。

Method: 通过合成图像对数据集分析人类偏好，研究图像质量属性（如美学、构图等）之间的关系，并对比LLMs的表现。

Result: 人类能轻松判断图像质量属性，而LLMs在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上表现较差，且属性间关系较弱。

Conclusion: 揭示了人类与多模态LLMs在图像感知上的显著差异。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角对象地理定位视为一次性检测任务，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏纠错机制。

Method: 提出ReCOT，将任务重新定义为循环定位任务，引入可学习令牌和两个互补模块（SAM知识蒸馏和参考特征增强模块）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到SOTA性能，参数减少60%。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环优化和模块增强，显著提升了跨视角对象地理定位的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

Result: 实验表明，A-TDOM能在秒级完成每张新图像的3DGS优化，保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM为实时TDOM生成提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种地理空间应用。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

TL;DR: BATR-FST提出了一种双层次自适应令牌细化方法，用于提升Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs在少样本学习中面临令牌级交互不足、训练数据有限和归纳偏差弱的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：预训练阶段使用MIM生成可迁移的补丁级表示；元微调阶段引入双层次自适应令牌细化模块，包括令牌聚类、不确定性感知令牌加权和双层次注意力机制。

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景中均表现出色。

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过令牌细化和归纳偏差优化，显著提升了ViTs的少样本分类性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Result: 在270例临床数据上，分类准确率为97.4%，AUC为98.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为胰腺肿瘤亚型诊断提供了更准确高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

TL;DR: 医学影像基础模型通过持续预训练在特定任务上表现优于通用模型，数据规模和监督方式对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据规模和预训练范式对医学影像基础模型性能的影响，以弥补当前医学影像模型因数据规模限制的性能瓶颈。

Method: 持续预训练两种视觉编码器（MI2和RAD-DINO），使用多达350万张胸部X光片，保持计算和评估协议一致。

Result: MI2在放射学发现相关任务上表现更好，RAD-DINO在管线相关任务上更强；结构化监督能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 机构特定的持续预训练能显著提升性能，少量领域内数据即可超越通用基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Motivation: NeRF生成图像的质量评估存在挑战，单一指标表现不佳，需结合不同感知方法的指标。

Result: 融合指标在主观评分相关性上表现优于单一指标，验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 融合DISTS和VMAF能有效提升NeRF生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Motivation: 数据收集在某些任务中具有挑战性，尤其是在罕见疾病或高成本场景下。LLM在医疗领域表现出色，可能为生成合成训练数据提供解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种映射方法，将视觉文档分割为200多个标记区域，结合引导解码、思维链推理和少样本提示技术，生成合成视觉文档。

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据在解决罕见疾病数据稀缺问题上具有潜力，方法可推广至其他领域。

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Motivation: 在真实场景中，由于缺乏真实标注，评估目标检测模型具有挑战性。

Result: 在Open Images和KITTI数据集上，CCS与F1分数等指标的一致性超过90%。

Conclusion: CCS为无监督监控目标检测器提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Conclusion: PENet通过双原型扩展和校准机制，有效提升了少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过MLLM和强化学习，显著提升了开放域指令的图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 通过高阶反演和DDTA机制，显著提升了Rectified Flow模型的生成质量和控制能力。

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

Method: 提出MEJO框架，包括S$^2$D学习方案（分解任务共享和任务特定表示）和CGL策略（协调头尾类梯度）。

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上验证了框架的优越性。

Conclusion: MEJO有效解决了优化冲突，提升了手术三重识别的性能。

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a

Conclusion: CLVS有效且通用，显著提升LVLMs的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中表现优异，细节保留和结构清晰度显著提升。

Conclusion: MSGFusion在语义一致性和下游任务通用性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Motivation: 现有跟踪器多关注空间线索，忽视时间依赖性，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互，增强时间一致性和特征表示。

Result: 在Jetson Nano上实时运行（7.1 FPS），成功率提升13.7%，精度提升14.7%。

Conclusion: T-SiamTPN证明了时间建模在Siamese跟踪中的重要性，是一种高效且强大的空中目标跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限场景，实现高吞吐量和实时检测。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 点云配准（PCR）质量验证对下游任务（如SLAM和对象跟踪）至关重要，但现有方法仅将其视为分类任务，限制了其细粒度量化能力。

Method: 使用回归方法进行PCR验证，结合多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合技术，以更精细地量化配准质量。

Result: 在多样化数据集上实现了准确且鲁棒的配准误差估计，尤其适用于空间密度不均的点云。

Conclusion: 该方法在下游任务（如地图构建）中显著提升了质量，优于现有的基于分类的方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS是一种基于4D雷达的自监督3D重建框架，用于动态驾驶场景，通过雷达辅助的Gaussian初始化和速度引导的PointTrack模型，解决了动态对象重建不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态对象重建中存在运动估计不精确和时间一致性弱的问题，导致动态场景元素表示不完整或失真。

Method: 提出4D雷达辅助的Gaussian初始化方案和速度引导的PointTrack模型，联合训练重建管道。

Result: 在OmniHD-Scenes数据集上实现了动态驾驶场景3D重建的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过结合4D雷达信息，显著提升了动态场景重建的准确性和时间一致性。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种绕过可微分渲染语义的新方法，通过预分解对象级高斯和CLIP特征聚合实现开放词汇对象检索和任务适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在场景理解中的模糊性问题，避免2D基础模型蒸馏的局限性。

Method: 利用预分解对象级高斯和多视角CLIP特征聚合，创建对象级嵌入表示。

Result: 有效克服3D开放词汇对象提取挑战，同时保持2D开放词汇分割的先进性能。

Conclusion: 新方法在3D场景理解中实现了突破，同时兼顾了性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TMKT的新方法，通过时间步混合策略和模态感知辅助学习目标，解决了RGB和DVS模态间的分布差异问题，提升了脉冲神经网络在视觉任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机和脉冲神经网络在高效视觉处理中潜力巨大，但事件数据稀缺和DVS输出稀疏性导致训练困难。现有方法忽略了RGB和DVS模态间的分布差异。

Method: 提出时间步混合知识迁移（TMKT），通过在不同时间步插值RGB和DVS输入，结合模态感知辅助学习目标，优化跨模态知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，TMKT在多个数据集上表现优异，缓解了模态偏移问题，提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: TMKT通过精细的时间步混合和辅助学习目标，实现了更平滑的知识迁移，为脉冲神经网络的高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击交互式创建分割掩码的方法，特别关注多表面分割，并引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表面在图像中同时存在且可能高度纠缠和相邻的分割挑战。

Method: 使用多模态输入的网络架构，结合RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，预测改进的分割掩码。

Result: 多模态融合策略显著减少所需点击次数（DeLiVER上平均减少1.28次，MFNet上减少1.19次），RGB基线在单掩码场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 方法在多模态多表面交互式分割任务中有效，多模态输入提升了性能，RGB基线在传统场景中也有竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古籍手写文档的文本行分割面临不规则书写、褪色墨迹和复杂布局等挑战，且缺乏大规模标注数据集。

Method: 竞赛要求参与者仅用每份手稿的三张标注图像进行训练，开发适用于U-DIADS-TL数据集的文本行分割系统。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多样化的古籍手稿，涵盖多种布局、退化程度和非标准格式，贴近实际场景。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过少样本学习推动开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，减少人工标注需求，促进自动化工具在历史研究中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIRENs在初始化不当时会出现频谱瓶颈现象，导致无法有效拟合目标信号。

Method: WINNER通过自适应高斯噪声扰动均匀初始化的权重，避免引入额外可训练参数。

Result: 在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中，WINNER优于基础SIREN。

Conclusion: WINNER为深度神经网络的自适应初始化策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专门检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，误检率高，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用VFM的线性分类器，分析文本-图像相似性，探究模型对伪造相关概念的学习能力。

Result: 新方法在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%，但模型性能受预训练数据时间限制影响。

Conclusion: 更新的VFM比静态检测器更有效，真实泛化评估需独立于模型预训练历史的数据。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过两阶段设计有效解决了遮挡区域控制问题，提升了生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法将LLMs的RL技术直接应用于VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs任务更复杂，需先准确感知视觉输入。

Method: 采用两阶段RL框架：第一阶段提升视觉感知能力，第二阶段增强推理能力；通过数据集级采样解决RL训练中的优势消失问题。

Result: 实验在七个基准数据集上验证了PeBR-R1模型在视觉推理任务中的优越性能。

Conclusion: 两阶段RL框架有效提升了VLMs的感知和推理能力，PeBR-R1在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Result: HERO在多种基准测试和模型规模下实现了高效的效率-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: HERO为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Conclusion: TFANet通过层次化多模态对齐框架有效解决了RIS任务中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

TL;DR: LLFDisc是一种U形深度增强网络，结合交叉注意力和门控机制，用于频率感知增强，通过分布感知损失和KL散度优化，显著提升了傅里叶域信息的对齐和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合方法过度关注局部信息，可能导致全局信息丢失，因此需要一种更鲁棒的频率感知增强方法。

Method: 提出LLFDisc网络，结合交叉注意力和门控机制，并设计分布感知损失和KL散度目标，直接拟合傅里叶域信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LLFDisc在定性和定量评估中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过新颖的损失函数和网络结构，有效提升了傅里叶域信息的对齐和结构保真度，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant
challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries,
especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust

leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Conclusion: CRPS-D数据集和SS-PSD方法为停车位检测提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

TL;DR: MSDNet提出了一种多阶段蒸馏框架，通过高效传输LiDAR先验到4D雷达特征，实现高质量重建和计算效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D雷达超分辨率方法训练成本高或依赖复杂扩散采样，导致推理延迟高、泛化能力差。

Method: MSDNet采用两阶段蒸馏：第一阶段通过特征重建对齐和稠密化学生特征；第二阶段通过轻量扩散网络细化特征，并引入噪声适配器自适应对齐噪声水平。

Result: 在VoD和内部数据集上，MSDNet实现了高保真重建和低延迟推理，并提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MSDNet在4D雷达点云超分辨率任务中表现出色，平衡了精度和效率。

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual,
multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents
such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness
contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Conclusion: LLMs为医学AI系统提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成和修复方面表现出色，但也可能被恶意利用。现有方法难以检测扩散修复模型生成的图像，即使训练数据中包含类似修复图像。

Method: End4设计了去噪重建模型，提高重建与检测过程的潜在空间对齐度，并利用尺度感知金字塔融合模块（SPFM）增强特征区分性。

Result: 实验表明，End4能有效泛化到未见过的掩码模式，并在各种扰动下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: End4为检测扩散修复模型生成的图像提供了有效解决方案，并建立了全面的基准数据集。

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）数据维度高且传输速率慢，需要轻量级模型支持星载处理并减少冗余数据传输。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission

introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise
process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data
requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResidualViT的视觉Transformer架构，通过利用视频中的时间冗余性，高效计算时间密集的帧级特征，显著降低计算成本并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率的帧级特征，但计算成本高昂。本文旨在降低此类任务的特征计算成本。

Method: 引入ResidualViT架构，包含可学习的残差连接和令牌缩减模块；提出轻量级蒸馏策略近似原始基础模型的帧级特征。

Result: 在四个任务和五个数据集上验证，计算成本降低60%，推理速度提升2.5倍，同时保持接近原始模型的精度。

Conclusion: ResidualViT通过高效利用时间冗余性，显著降低了时间密集任务的计算负担，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训缺乏即时和可扩展的反馈，RadGame旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 平台包括RadGame Localize（定位异常）和RadGame Report（撰写报告），利用公共数据集和AI反馈。

Result: 使用RadGame的学习者在定位和报告撰写准确性上分别提高了68%和31%，远超传统方法。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在放射学教育中的潜力，为医学AI资源在教育中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated

use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一种无需训练的方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，支持纹理、几何或两者的风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产是常见需求，但现有方法难以实现精细的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn)模块，通过跨3D注意力机制动态融合内容和风格特征，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略避免语义内容泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: StyleSculptor通过创新的SD-Attn模块和SGC机制，实现了无需训练的、精细风格控制的3D资产生成。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Motivation: 解决2D和3D数据之间的表示空间统一问题，减少多帧标注的需求，提升跨帧空间推理的准确性。

Method: 通过3D位置嵌入增强2D视觉特征，构建共享视觉标记空间，支持多种区域标注方式（如边界框、分割掩码）。

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，提升了场景理解能力，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为几何红队（GRT）的框架，通过对象几何扰动自动生成CrashShapes，以评估机器人操作策略的鲁棒性，并展示了通过蓝队微调显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人操作策略评估协议局限于静态测试集，无法揭示策略在几何变化下的脆弱性。

Method: GRT结合基于雅可比场的变形模型和无梯度优化策略，自动生成结构有效的几何变形（CrashShapes），并通过仿真和真实机器人验证。

Result: GRT成功发现导致策略崩溃的几何变形，蓝队微调将任务成功率提升高达60%，且仿真结果与真实实验一致。

Conclusion: GRT为机器人操作提供了通用的鲁棒性评估框架，CrashShapes可用于针对性策略优化。

Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight
into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric
Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through
object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --
structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the
corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

Result: 通过仿真和实验验证，该方法显著减少了控制努力，同时保持了编队性能。

Conclusion: 事件触发策略在资源受限的多智能体编队控制中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collaborative formation control for
multi-agent systems with limited resources. We consider a team of robots tasked
with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To
reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a
distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent
distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement
error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed
controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments involving different formations, communication topologies,
scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being
compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the
event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving
formation performance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模拟和真实数据中均能提供无漂移的相对和绝对方向估计，且关节位置估计收敛快且稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了传统惯性运动捕捉的校准问题，实现了实时、轻量级的运动捕捉。

Abstract: Inertial motion capture is a promising approach for capturing motion outside
the laboratory. However, as one major drawback, most of the current methods
require different quantities to be calibrated or computed offline as part of
the setup process, such as segment lengths, relative orientations between
inertial measurement units (IMUs) and segment coordinate frames (IMU-to-segment
calibrations) or the joint positions in the IMU frames. This renders the setup
process inconvenient. This work contributes to real-time capable
calibration-free inertial tracking of a kinematic chain, i.e. simultaneous
recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint
positions in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size. Experimental results on
simulated IMU data from a three-link kinematic chain (manipulator study) as
well as re-simulated IMU data from healthy humans walking (lower body study)
show that the calibration-free and lightweight algorithm provides not only
drift-free relative but also drift-free absolute orientation estimates with a
global heading reference for only one IMU as well as robust and fast
convergence of joint position estimates in the different movement scenarios.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在仅使用肌腱长度输入时的有效性，实现了静态条件下的开环控制。

Conclusion: 该方法避免了张力测量和状态估计的难题，为超冗余系统的静态控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators of- fer greater flexibility and
compliance over traditional manipu- lators. A common way of controlling such
manipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control
parameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is
representative of the real operational con- ditions. However, when dealing with
manipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a
static force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping
from the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,
measurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust
tendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement
or state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not
always accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables
tension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.
We develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,
hyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics
iterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length
or tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a
traditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the
method when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the
possibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic
input only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension
measurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

Abstract: Deformable substrates such as sand and mud present significant challenges for
terrestrial robots due to complex robot-terrain interactions. Inspired by
mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and
movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design
and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media.
Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally
compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail
configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body
drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was
enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing
resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation
strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the
oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion
depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail
action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results
offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion
on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search
and rescue, and environmental exploration.

Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable
natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent
work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal
communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for
generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and
reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns
a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures
with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised
learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual
reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system
achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised

Abstract: Autonomous robots must go from zero prior knowledge to safe control within
seconds to operate in unstructured environments. Abrupt terrain changes, such
as a sudden transition to ice, create dynamics shifts that can destabilize
planners unless the model adapts in real-time. We present a method for online
adaptation that combines function encoders with recursive least squares,
treating the function encoder coefficients as latent states updated from
streaming odometry. This yields constant-time coefficient estimation without
gradient-based inner-loop updates, enabling adaptation from only a few seconds
of data. We evaluate our approach on a Van der Pol system to highlight
algorithmic behavior, in a Unity simulator for high-fidelity off-road
navigation, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot, including on a challenging terrain
at a local ice rink. Across these settings, our method improves model accuracy
and downstream planning, reducing collisions compared to static and
meta-learning baselines.

TL;DR: PVMs在基于模型的强化学习（MBRL）中显著提升视觉策略学习的鲁棒性，尤其在严重视觉域偏移下表现优于基线模型。部分微调PVMs能保持最佳任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练视觉模型（PVMs）在MBRL中的有效性，尤其是视觉域偏移下的泛化能力，以解决现有工作中PVMs在MBRL中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 在MBRL框架下，比较PVMs与从头训练模型的性能，并研究不同程度微调PVMs的效果。

Result: PVMs在严重视觉域偏移下表现更优，部分微调能维持极端分布偏移下的最高平均任务性能。

Conclusion: PVMs在视觉策略学习中显著提升鲁棒性，支持其在基于模型的机器人学习中的广泛应用。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在长期任务和高精度控制中因累积误差表现不佳，现有残差策略学习缺乏全局状态理解。

Method: 利用Koopman算子理论在潜在空间中建模全局动态，指导残差策略更新。

Result: 在长期精细机器人装配任务中，KORR表现优于基线，具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: Koopman建模有望连接现代学习方法和经典控制理论。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在资源受限平台上部署时，因大量视觉令牌的注意力计算而受限，LightVLA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LightVLA通过动态查询评估视觉令牌重要性，采用Gumbel softmax实现可微分剪枝，无需启发式参数或额外可训练参数。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，LightVLA将FLOPs和延迟分别降低59.1%和38.2%，任务成功率提升2.9%。

Conclusion: LightVLA首次将自适应视觉令牌剪枝应用于VLA任务，显著提升效率和性能，推动实时机器人系统发展。

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

TL;DR: ActiveVLN是一个通过多轮强化学习实现主动探索的VLN框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法依赖模仿学习和专家轨迹，缺乏主动探索能力，限制了导航路线的多样性。

Method: ActiveVLN结合模仿学习初始化代理，通过多轮RL进行主动探索，并采用动态早停策略优化效率。

Result: ActiveVLN在性能上显著优于模仿学习和现有RL方法，且使用更小模型达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: ActiveVLN通过主动探索和多轮RL解决了现有方法的局限性，展示了高效且性能优越的导航能力。

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Conclusion: PerchMobi^3为多模态机器人移动提供了新设计范式，具有自主和应用导向部署的潜力。

Abstract: Achieving seamless integration of aerial flight, ground driving, and wall
climbing within a single robotic platform remains a major challenge, as
existing designs often rely on additional adhesion actuators that increase
complexity, reduce efficiency, and compromise reliability. To address these
limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure,
air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse
mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial
thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively
driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a
lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal
locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation
across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The
feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of
experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial
flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across
locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a
novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for
future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.

Conclusion: 基于物理的稀疏安全评估是一种可扩展的策略，适用于不确定性下的安全机器人操作。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in dynamic and unstructured environments requires safety
mechanisms that exploit what is known and what is uncertain about the world.
Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their
applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering
scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under
uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal
parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical
state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable
grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through
probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual
manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe
trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight
physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic
manipulation under uncertainty.

Result: UDON在标准数据集和真实硬件上显著优于基线，通信成功率低至1%仍保持高保真重建。

Conclusion: UDON在极端通信退化下仍能实现高质量多机器人神经隐式建图。

Abstract: Multi-robot mapping with neural implicit representations enables the compact
reconstruction of complex environments. However, it demands robustness against
communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior
works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions,
performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success
rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit
mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed
optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication
deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of
the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping
disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct
extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot
hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing
baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene
representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1%
success rate).

Conclusion: MoiréTac在灵巧操作中展现出潜力，如机器人开盖任务。

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial
resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve
this problem, we present \textbf{Moir\'eTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates
dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent
architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moir\'e
patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical
clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moir\'e fields for tactile
sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact
localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features
(brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moir\'e patterns
with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque
measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning.
Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement
with R^2 > 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric
parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object
classification despite moir\'e overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a
robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control,
validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO) is a critical task in robotics,
often challenged by real-world uncertainties such as observation noise, model
approximations, action failures, and partial observability. Existing solutions
frequently assume ideal conditions, leading to suboptimal or risky decisions.
This paper introduces NAMOUnc, a novel framework designed to address these
uncertainties by integrating them into the decision-making process. We first
estimate them and compare the corresponding time cost intervals for removing
and bypassing obstacles, optimizing both the success rate and time efficiency,
ensuring safer and more efficient navigation. We validate our method through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating significant

Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

Abstract: This paper explores traversability estimation for robot navigation. A key
bottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable
and robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic
information across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of
Experts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability
estimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models
for specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based
or a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain
types. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based
on the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers
three advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively
leverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances
generalization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach
significantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by
introducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to
minimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach
uses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating
networks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.
Extensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and
performance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across
different domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average
computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path
quality.

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中，ActOwL以更少问题实现更高所有权聚类准确率。

Conclusion: 结合主动推理和LLM常识推理，显著提升机器人获取所有权知识的能力。

Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

Abstract: Jumping constitutes an essential component of quadruped robots' locomotion
capabilities, which includes dynamic take-off and adaptive landing. Existing
quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by
assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases.
This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on
rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion
generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning
of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation
strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery
period. Extensive experiments validate the accurate tracking and safe landing
skills benefiting from our proposed method in various scenarios.

(\textbf{S-MSP}), a differentiable framework that maps synchronized multi-view
camera observations and an STL specification directly to a feasible trajectory.
S-MSP integrates STL constraints within a unified pipeline, trained with a
composite loss that combines trajectory reconstruction and STL robustness. A
\emph{structure-aware} Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model enables horizon-aware
specialization by projecting sub-tasks into temporally anchored embeddings. We
evaluate S-MSP using a high-fidelity simulation of factory-logistics scenarios
with temporally constrained tasks. Experiments show that S-MSP outperforms
single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and trajectory feasibility. A
rule-based \emph{safety filter} at inference improves physical executability
without compromising logical correctness, showcasing the practicality of the
approach.

Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

Result: 研究强调了操作员技能建模的重要性，尤其是在复杂任务（如焊接）中，延迟反馈和错误不可逆性增加了挑战。

Conclusion: 通过整合认知约束和谓词逻辑，可以更好地理解和建模操作员技能，为人机协作提供理论基础。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction is increasingly important in industry, and this
trend will only intensify with the rise of Industry 5.0. Human operators have
skills that need to be adapted when using machines to achieve the best results.
It is crucial to highlight the operator's skills and understand how they use
and adapt them [18]. A rigorous description of these skills is necessary to
compare performance with and without robot assistance. Predicate logic, used by
Vergnaud within Piaget's scheme concept, offers a promising approach. However,
this theory doesn't account for cognitive system constraints, such as the
timing of actions, the limitation of cognitive resources, the parallelization
of tasks, or the activation of automatic gestures contrary to optimal
knowledge. Integrating these constraints is essential for representing agent
skills understanding skill transfer between biological and mechanical
structures. Cognitive architectures models [2] address these needs by
describing cognitive structure and can be combined with the scheme for mutual
benefit. Welding provides a relevant case study, as it highlights the
challenges faced by operators, even highly skilled ones. Welding's complexity
stems from the need for constant skill adaptation to variable parameters like
part position and process. This adaptation is crucial, as weld quality, a key
factor, is only assessed afterward via destructive testing. Thus, the welder is
confronted with a complex perception-decision-action cycle, where the
evaluation of the impact of his actions is delayed and where errors are
definitive. This dynamic underscores the importance of understanding and
modeling the skills of operators.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid
locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment:
policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control
or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper
resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely
proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of
perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a
contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode
privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this
``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to
proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the
terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked
gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust
locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg}
slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method. Website:

Result: 实验显示GRATE在距离和时间效率上分别提升21.5%和21.3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRATE通过增强推理和运动规划能力，显著提升了自主机器人探索的效率。

Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously
navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making
problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods
often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data.
Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting
RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while
neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph
Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global
contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's
reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a
Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path
is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5%
in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art
conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We
also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In Social Robot Navigation (SRN), the availability of meaningful metrics is
crucial for evaluating trajectories from human-robot interactions. In the SRN
context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or
more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the
resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work,
which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this
framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by
introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement
metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a
comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd
interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the
cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess
behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability,
design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.

Abstract: Establishing standardized metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN)
algorithms for assessing the quality and social compliance of robot behavior
around humans is essential for SRN research. Currently, commonly used
evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent
behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach
scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one
agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To
address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity
metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of
evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given
algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took
responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the
development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN,
ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in
human-centric environments.

Abstract: Laser vision sensors (LVS) are critical perception modules for industrial
robots, facilitating real-time acquisition of workpiece geometric data in
welding applications. However, the camera communication delay will lead to a
temporal desynchronization between captured images and the robot motions.
Additionally, hand-eye extrinsic parameters may vary during prolonged
measurement. To address these issues, we introduce a measurement model of LVS
considering the effect of the camera's time-offset and propose a teaching-free
spatiotemporal calibration method utilizing line constraints. This method
involves a robot equipped with an LVS repeatedly scanning straight-line fillet
welds using S-shaped trajectories. Regardless of the robot's orientation
changes, all measured welding positions are constrained to a straight-line,
represented by Plucker coordinates. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model
based on straight-line constraints is established. Subsequently, the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is employed to optimize parameters,
including time-offset, hand-eye extrinsic parameters, and straight-line
parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are
quantitatively validated through experiments on curved weld scanning. We
open-sourced the code, dataset, and simulation report at

Abstract: Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are widely employed for their versatility
and structural simplicity. In such systems, compact sensing integration and
proper interpretation aligned with underactuation are crucial for realizing
practical grasp functionalities. This study proposes an anthropomorphic
underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive situational awareness of
hand-object interaction, utilizing tendon-based proprioception provided by
series elastic actuators (SEAs). We developed a compact SEA with high accuracy
and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By
coupling proprioceptive sensing with potential energy-based modeling, the
system estimates key grasp-related variables, including contact timing, joint
angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating
external disturbances. These estimated variables enable grasp posture
reconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with
proprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness.
Finger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that
tendon-based proprioception serves as a compact and robust sensing modality for
practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.

Motivation: 在复杂不确定环境中，SARs需要主动检测和处理异常行为（OOD），数字孪生为此提供了有效解决方案。

Method: ODiSAR使用基于Transformer的数字孪生预测SAR状态，并通过重构误差和蒙特卡洛dropout进行不确定性量化，结合两者检测OOD行为。

Result: 在工业机器人实验中，ODiSAR实现了高达98% AUROC、96% TNR@TPR95和95% F1-score的检测性能。

Conclusion: ODiSAR不仅能高效检测OOD行为，还提供可解释的见解以支持SARs的自适应调整。

Abstract: Self-adaptive robots (SARs) in complex, uncertain environments must
proactively detect and address abnormal behaviors, including
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. To this end, digital twins offer a valuable
solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for
OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to
forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout
for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

Abstract: Automatic docking has long been a significant challenge in the field of
mobile robotics. Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking
methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an
efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods
impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the
docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods,
we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct
visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera
installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path,
achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a
large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a
combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and
actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to
quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive
experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted
into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.
Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy,
with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet
physical constraints and reach the target pose.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as
security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such
monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential
advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring
solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in
real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of
multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise
time between visits to points of interest, within environments where
traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by
patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In
this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment
dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic
scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly
accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

Abstract: This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand
that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp
envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the
required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the
adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint
with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the
digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the
hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement
learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies
that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving
enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully
performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including
challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the
design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous
manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range
of applications.

Abstract: Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

Motivation: 研究脑脊液动力学和神经系统疾病的病理过程需要精确调节颅内压波形。

Result: MPC将电机位置跟踪误差降低了83%（均值）和73%（最大值），BO算法在20次迭代内学习到目标波形。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效调节颅内压波形，优于传统PID控制器。

Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based control framework for a soft robotic
actuator system designed to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms,
which is essential for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and pathological
processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed
to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive
controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking
of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints.
Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor
position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online
learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP
modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a
brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a
previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC
reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and
73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor
position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean
and amplitude.

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中验证了模型的有效性，强调了建模传感器动力学路径依赖性的重要性。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅准确捕捉了路径依赖行为，还支持基于梯度的轨迹优化，与高分辨率触觉反馈无缝集成。

Abstract: Tactile sensors have long been valued for their perceptual capabilities,
offering rich insights into the otherwise hidden interface between the robot
and grasped objects. Yet their inherent compliance -- a key driver of
force-rich interactions -- remains underexplored. The central challenge is to
capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics introduced by these passive-compliant
elements. Here, we present a computationally efficient non-holonomic
hydroelastic model that accurately models path-dependent contact force
distributions and dynamic surface area variations. Our insight is to extend the
object's state space, explicitly incorporating the distributed forces generated
by the compliant sensor. Our differentiable formulation not only accounts for
path-dependent behavior but also enables gradient-based trajectory
optimization, seamlessly integrating with high-resolution tactile feedback. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of simulated and
real-world experiments and highlight the importance of modeling the path
dependence of sensor dynamics.

Result: 在环岛模拟器中，UWDT在奖励、碰撞率和行为稳定性上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的时空变换器能够为复杂交通环境中的自动驾驶提供更安全高效的决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires
extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data
are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or
collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents
TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and
geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at

retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources.
Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and
orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street
views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded
sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By
bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and

Conclusion: ROOM能够大规模生成多样化患者解剖数据，支持医疗机器人技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Continuum robots are advancing bronchoscopy procedures by accessing complex
lung airways and enabling targeted interventions. However, their development is
limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is
difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns,
and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical
feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a
comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic
bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline
renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and
light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point
clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in
two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and
monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that
state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings.
Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune
existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling
other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will
enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and
procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings. Code

TL;DR: StageACT通过阶段条件模仿学习框架提升人形机器人开门任务的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开门是人形机器人在日常环境中必备的技能，但由于部分可观测性（如门闩状态）和长时程任务特性，标准行为克隆容易失败。

Method: 提出StageACT框架，通过任务阶段输入增强低级策略，提高对部分可观测性的鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实办公环境中，StageACT对未见过的门实现了55%的成功率，是基线方法的两倍多。

Conclusion: 阶段条件是一种轻量且有效的机制，适用于长时程人形机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Humanoid robots promise to operate in everyday human environments without
requiring modifications to the surroundings. Among the many skills needed,
opening doors is essential, as doors are the most common gateways in built
spaces and often limit where a robot can go. Door opening, however, poses
unique challenges as it is a long-horizon task under partial observability,
such as reasoning about the door's unobservable latch state that dictates
whether the robot should rotate the handle or push the door. This ambiguity
makes standard behavior cloning prone to mode collapse, yielding blended or
out-of-sequence actions. We introduce StageACT, a stage-conditioned imitation
learning framework that augments low-level policies with task-stage inputs.
This effective addition increases robustness to partial observability, leading
to higher success rates and shorter completion times. On a humanoid operating
in a real-world office environment, StageACT achieves a 55% success rate on
previously unseen doors, more than doubling the best baseline. Moreover, our
method supports intentional behavior guidance through stage prompting, enabling
recovery behaviors. These results highlight stage conditioning as a lightweight
yet powerful mechanism for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

Abstract: We present a hierarchical RL pipeline for training one-armed legged robots to
perform pick-and-place (P&P) tasks end-to-end -- from approaching the payload
to releasing it at a target area -- in both single-robot and cooperative
dual-robot settings. We introduce a novel dynamic reward curriculum that
enables a single policy to efficiently learn long-horizon P&P operations by
progressively guiding the agents through payload-centered sub-objectives.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches for long-horizon RL tasks, our method
improves training efficiency by 55% and reduces execution time by 18.6% in
simulation experiments. In the dual-robot case, we show that our policy enables
each robot to attend to different components of its observation space at
distinct task stages, promoting effective coordination via autonomous attention
shifts. We validate our method through real-world experiments using ANYmal D
platforms in both single- and dual-robot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is
the first RL pipeline that tackles the full scope of collaborative P&P with two
legged manipulators.

Abstract: The endurance and energy efficiency of drones remain critical challenges in
their design and operation. To extend mission duration, numerous studies
explored perching mechanisms that enable drones to conserve energy by
temporarily suspending flight. This paper presents a new perching drone that
utilizes an active flexible perching mechanism inspired by the rapid predation
mechanism of the Venus flytrap, achieving perching in less than 100 ms. The
proposed system is designed for high-speed adaptability to the perching
targets. The overall drone design is outlined, followed by the development and
validation of the biomimetic perching structure. To enhance the system
stability, a cascade extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control method is
developed, which can estimate and compensate for the external disturbance in
real time. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the
perching structure and the superiority of the cascaded EHGO in resisting wind

Motivation: 现代电力系统日益动态化，但公开测试案例稀缺，需要生成工具来合成电网结构和动态负载。

Result: PowerGrow在保真度和多样性上优于现有扩散模型，实现了98.9%的潮流收敛率和改进的N-1应急恢复能力。

Conclusion: PowerGrow能够生成操作有效且现实的电网场景。

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

Conclusion: Ada方法在去中心化训练中表现稳定，模型精度与中心化学习相当，适用于大规模DNN训练。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLMs）安全对齐中过度拒绝合法请求的问题，同时避免单一解锁向量带来的无差别风险。

Method: 提出MEUV框架，通过多任务目标学习主题对齐、近乎正交的解锁向量，结合差分消融边界、跨主题和正交性惩罚。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2B等模型上攻击成功率≥87%，跨主题泄漏减少90%，且中英文向量可无缝迁移。

Conclusion: MEUV实现了细粒度主题级能力激活，为安全敏感领域部署可控LLMs提供了可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比传统策略减少了14.20%至41.48%的训练时间，且对更大模型和更多客户端的扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了卫星网络中联邦学习的调度问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: TripOptimizer提供了一种更灵活的气动形状优化方法，减少了对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖，尤其适用于早期设计阶段。

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are

this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应路由框架，用于处理多任务、多模态预测中的数据异质性和任务交互问题，应用于心理治疗领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理治疗中结构化评估和非结构化临床笔记共存，数据部分缺失且结果相关，需要动态选择模态处理路径和任务共享策略。

Method: 引入路由架构，动态选择模态路径和任务共享策略，定义多模态路径并学习路由决策，端到端训练。

Result: 在合成数据和真实心理治疗笔记上评估，优于固定多任务或单任务基线，路由策略提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 框架解决了个性化医疗中的关键挑战，可提升心理健康结果和治疗精准度。

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在资源受限的消费级GPU上高效微调大型语言模型的方法，为研究者和实践者提供实用指南。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct模型，在NVIDIA RTX 4060上进行了系统化的性能分析，测试了不同批次大小、序列长度、优化器和精度配置。

Result: 分页优化器（PagedAdamW）能提升25%的吞吐量，bf16精度效率低于fp16，2048长度的序列在8GB显存下仍可行。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境下的LLM微调提供了可复现的基准和实用建议，填补了消费级GPU上系统化研究的空白。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine- tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Motivation: 现有多模态模型在临床环境中常因模态缺失而预测不准确，需要提高模型灵活性。

Method: 采用独立路由器替代传统单一路由器，处理多模态数据（T1-MRI、FLAIR、淀粉样蛋白PET、tau PET）。

Result: PerM-MoE在大多数模态缺失情况下优于现有方法，并更有效地利用了专家。

Conclusion: PerM-MoE在多模态缺失情况下表现出色，为AD预测提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

Result: 发现OOD性能与奇异向量旋转强相关，而非奇异值变化；RL主要恢复SFT丢失的能力。

Conclusion: 重新定义了SFT和RL在两阶段微调中的角色，揭示了奇异向量旋转是性能变化的关键机制。

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统数值方法在模拟残余应力与变形耦合时计算成本高，尤其在几何多样性情况下。神经算子虽能高效求解偏微分方程，但在变化几何域中应用受限。

Method: 通过微分同胚神经网络将复杂三维几何映射到共同参考域，并在该域上训练神经算子，学习残余应力引起的变形场。

Result: 方法能高效预测主方向和多方向变形场，在不同几何结构（包括组件类型、尺寸和特征）中实现高精度和高效率。

Conclusion: NDNO为几何多样性结构组件的变形预测提供了高效且计算成本低的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Motivation: 滤泡性甲状腺癌缺乏独特的超声特征，术前诊断较困难，相关临床研究较少，因此需要新的数据挖掘工具辅助诊断。

Method: 基于2010-2023年北京大学第三医院普外科病例数据，改进关联规则挖掘方法，结合SHAP思想提出新的分析指标。

Result: 研究发现结节内结节模式、梁状模式、低TSH评分等指标与恶性关联较强，同时桥本甲状腺炎的组合也可能具有强恶性关联。

Conclusion: 术前诊断应考虑多种临床指标，研究发现的恶性关联指标可为临床医生提供参考。

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

Result: 证明了在训练损失趋零时，非等效观测必须映射到不同的潜在表示，辅助任务锚定了表示必须保留的区分。

Conclusion: 通过辅助任务和动态联合训练可以改进JEPA编码器，生成更丰富的表示。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE适用于银行规模网络，为金融机构提供了可操作的机器学习蓝图。

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

Result: 为Transformer中的缩放点积或softmax函数提供了新的概率解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为Transformer架构的核心机制提供了新的理论支持，可能启发未来的改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial

closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction
accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and
the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The
quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research
represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial
forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over
traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders,

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

*Michael Freedman,Michael Mulligan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，传统神经网络优化过程中会自然产生Kolmogorov-Arnold（KA）几何特征，通过统计方法量化了这些特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络如何有机地学习为下游处理准备数据，并探索KA几何特征的出现以优化学习过程。

Method: 通过分析单隐藏层神经网络的Jacobian矩阵的统计特性（如零行数和次要统计量）来量化KA几何特征。

Result: 发现KA几何特征在函数复杂度和模型超参数空间中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了KA几何特征在神经网络中的自然涌现，为优化学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Result: 框架提高了利润，减少了食物浪费，增强了决策准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生鲜零售等易腐品行业提供了可扩展的动态定价和库存管理解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Result: FEDONet在多个PDE数据集上表现优于传统DeepONet，平均L2性能提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: 傅里叶嵌入有效增强了神经算子学习，为PDE代理建模提供了鲁棒方法。

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Conclusion: Partitioned-LDA方法有效提升了有限训练样本下词嵌入在表格数据分类中的性能。

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Conclusion: MEAGraph为表示学习和聚类提供了有效方法，适用于数据分析、异常检测和数据集优化。

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于其他FF方法，MNIST准确率99.65%，FashionMNIST 93.41%，CIFAR-10 90.62%，CIFAR-100 65.42%，并首次在ImageNet上实现26.21% Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，显著缩小了与BP训练模型的性能差距，为可扩展的无BP CNN训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising al- ternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the origi- nal algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational ca- pacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE lever- ages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness rep- resentations at each
layer, enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful ap- plication of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely elimi- nating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

Conclusion: B-PMMs为不确定性关键领域的稳健谱学习提供了新框架，并为更广泛的贝叶斯谱机器学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

Result: SRI在机器学习预测精度中等时减少标准误差50%以上，并在人类标注存在误差时仍有效。

Conclusion: SRI为依赖机器学习和人类标注的研究提供了更高效和稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.

TL;DR: 比较边界元法（BEM）和物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在二维Helmholtz方程波散射问题中的性能，发现PINNs训练时间长但评估快，BEM稳定性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估BEM和PINNs在相同条件下解决Helmholtz方程的性能，为波传播问题提供方法选择依据。

Method: 分别用BEM和PINNs求解同一散射问题，BEM通过边界离散化，PINNs通过优化控制方程和边界条件的残差训练。

Result: PINNs训练时间比BEM长42倍，但评估快204倍；在训练域外，PINNs误差显著增加，BEM保持稳定。

Conclusion: PINNs适合快速评估但训练成本高，BEM稳定性更好；研究为波传播问题的方法选择提供了定量依据。

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NTM的新型神经网络架构，用于计算图上的随机微分博弈中的纳什均衡，通过固定非训练组件减少参数并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图结构多智能体系统在金融、机器人等领域中的不确定性交互问题，同时提升模型的解释性和稳定性。

Method: 设计了一种图引导的稀疏化前馈神经网络，嵌入固定非训练组件，并验证其通用逼近能力。

Result: 实验表明NTM方法在性能上与全训练方法相当，但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: NTM架构为大规模稀疏场景下的博弈求解提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

Result: 基础模型在零样本预测中表现优异，且能更精确检测因果交互。

Conclusion: 基础模型在时间序列预测和因果发现中具有多功能性和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM的广泛应用引发了安全担忧，尤其是其输出偏好可能被恶意操控，导致难以检测的偏见响应。

Method: 提出Preference Hijacking (Phi)方法，通过偏好劫持图像在推理时操控MLLM的输出偏好，无需修改模型。

Result: 实验证明Phi方法在各种任务中有效，且能通过通用扰动实现跨图像的偏好劫持。

Conclusion: Phi方法揭示了MLLM的安全漏洞，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

Motivation: 现有GNN在异质性图上表现不佳，需创新方法解决。

Method: 提出GRAPHITE框架，通过特征节点提升同质性。

Result: 在异质性图上显著优于SOTA，同质性图上表现相当。

Conclusion: GRAPHITE为异质性图问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确分类不同属性的时间序列数据，对异常具有高敏感性，检测速度快且鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: 该方法在时间序列异常检测中表现出高效性和准确性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Conclusion: iCD简单有效，适用于多种师生架构，尤其在细粒度分类中表现突出。

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

Motivation: 现有学习延迟方法对专家组成变化敏感且需大量重新训练，需更灵活、无需训练的替代方案。

Result: 在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上准确率达99.57%和99.40%，专家工作量减少11倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际人机协作提供了可扩展、无需重新训练的替代方案。

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: 为受限环境下部署训练数据归因提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

Conclusion: FedFD通过频域设计有效解决了联邦学习中的通信和性能问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

Conclusion: TimeRep通过利用TSFMs的中间层表示和动态适应机制，实现了更优的异常检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实例级随机化（ILR）方法，以减少大语言模型（LLM）评估中的不稳定性，并通过多实验平均分数提升公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估中，随机因素（如few-shot示例）的小变化会导致分数和模型排名的剧烈波动，可能导致不公平比较。

Method: 提出ILR方法，对每个实例随机化所有影响评估分数的因素，运行多次实验并报告平均分数。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，ILR能减少随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，且计算成本减半。

Conclusion: ILR方法有效提升了LLM评估的稳定性和公平性，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Conclusion: NQS的缩放规律与语言模型不同，需针对具体应用优化资源分配。

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

### [211] [Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694)
*Jiadong Hong,Lei Liu,Xinyu Bian,Wenjie Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Soft Graph Transformer (SGT)，一种用于MIMO检测的软输入-软输出神经网络架构，结合消息传递和图感知注意力机制，接近ML性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML检测复杂度高，传统消息传递算法依赖大系统渐近性和随机矩阵假设，而现有Transformer检测器未利用MIMO因子图结构和解码器软信息。

Method: SGT将消息传递集成到图感知注意力机制中，支持通过软输入嵌入进行解码器信息更新。

Result: SGT作为独立检测器接近ML性能，优于现有Transformer方法。

Conclusion: SGT设计有效生成软输出并保持计算效率，适用于迭代检测-解码。

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层个性化框架，用于在联邦学习中微调基础模型，解决小规模数据场景下的个性化与联邦学习的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小规模新用户或特定场景下基础模型微调的挑战，平衡个性化与联邦学习的敏感性问题。

Method: 采用双层个性化框架：客户端级使用私有数据进行个性化微调，服务器级通过任务向量测量相似用户进行个性化聚合。

Result: 在基准数据集上通过实验验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在非独立同分布数据下实现群体个性化，同时减少无关或兴趣冲突客户的干扰。

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Result: NORA提高了分类性能，尤其在早期CKD的F1分数上表现突出，并在不同患者队列中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: NORA是一种有效的CKD风险分层工具，适用于不同临床环境。

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Fisher信息矩阵（FIM）的图持续学习（GCL）正则化框架，并提出了新的在线曲率近似方法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在无回放、类增量设置下，现有方法（如EWC）因使用对角近似FIM而受限。

Method: 提出基于当前学习状态的在线曲率近似方法，直接估计正则项，无需显式计算和存储FIM。

Result: 在三个图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稳定性和可塑性之间取得了更好的平衡，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过在线曲率近似方法，能够更好地捕捉损失景观，同时保留旧知识，为GCL提供了一种有效的正则化框架。

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图机器学习和网络分析的方法，用于检测金融交易图中的拓扑模式，以应对传统规则系统无法适应复杂犯罪行为的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字生态系统的兴起使金融领域面临跨环境的犯罪手段，传统规则系统缺乏适应性，需要新策略分析行为交互以发现可疑活动。

Method: 提出四步预处理框架（提取图结构、考虑时间性、检测社区、自动标记），并比较三种图自编码器变体来识别拓扑模式。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法能有效检测复杂金融犯罪方案，优于传统规则系统。

Conclusion: 这种基于拓扑的方法为金融犯罪检测提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

Motivation: 癌症是第二大死因，传统通路分析依赖湿实验数据，耗时且效率低。

Method: 结合时间序列机器学习模型和通路分析，从TCGA数据库提取突变序列，预处理筛选关键突变，用RNN预测癌症严重程度，再结合药物靶点数据库预测突变和推荐治疗。

Result: ROC曲线准确率超60%，与现有诊断方法相当，预处理成功筛选出关键突变。

Conclusion: 首次提出不依赖湿实验的高效端到端框架，为癌症进展预测和治疗推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

<details>

Motivation: 改进标准softmax函数，增强其对协变量偏移和分布外输入的鲁棒性，并提供可解释性。

Method: 通过引入相似性（正确预测的深度匹配）和距离感知（与训练分布的距离）到现有输出幅度感知中，构建SDM激活函数。

Result: SDM在语言模型中表现更鲁棒，能有效处理高概率区域的协变量偏移和分布外输入，并提供密集匹配的可解释性。

Conclusion: SDM适用于选择性分类，优于后校准的softmax方法。

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

Abstract: Machine learning models and libraries can train datasets of different sizes
and perform prediction and classification operations, but machine learning
models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This
article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Motivation: 缺乏对SE-RL和SP-RL差异的正式理解，尤其是在安全关键场景中的实际应用。

Result: 动作别名对SP-RL影响更大，但通过改进策略，SP-RL可以优于SE-RL。

Conclusion: 研究为基于任务特性选择和优化安全RL方法提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

Conclusion: Tool-R1展示了在现实应用中实现可靠高效工具增强推理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

Motivation: 揭示TimeCluster与经典线性子空间识别方法的数学等价性，为时间序列分析提供新的视角和工具。

Method: 通过比较TimeCluster和子空间系统识别理论，证明滑动窗口矩阵形成Hankel矩阵，PCA（通过SVD）应用后得到相同的主方向。

Result: 实验证实两种嵌入方法在合成和真实动态信号中结果一致。

Conclusion: 这种等价性为未来研究提供了新机会，如状态空间预测、流式扩展和可视化外部输入。

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

Motivation: DEQs梯度计算近似导致训练不稳定，需额外正则化或多次函数评估。

Method: 提出可逆深度平衡模型（RevDEQs），支持精确梯度计算，减少函数评估。

Result: RevDEQs在语言建模和图像分类任务中优于同类隐式和显式模型。

Conclusion: RevDEQs解决了DEQs的梯度问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: 对称性是实现公平对抗性鲁棒性的可行路径，Sy-FAR在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Conclusion: 该方法为心脏运动分析提供了灵活的工具，并为基于图的生物医学时空数据学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Motivation: 探索PFL框架的安全性，填补其在后门攻击方面的研究空白。

Method: 提出BAPFL，结合原型毒化策略和触发器优化机制，针对PFL框架设计。

Result: BAPFL在攻击成功率上提升35%-75%，同时保持主任务准确性。

Conclusion: BAPFL展示了在PFL中的高效性、隐蔽性和适应性。

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分位数部分效应（QPE）的因果发现方法，通过观测分布的形状不对称性识别因果方向，适用于双变量和多变量场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果模型（如FCM）依赖于噪声假设或机制模型，而QPE直接从观测数据中提取形状特征，简化了因果识别。

Method: 利用QPE的有限线性跨度假设，通过基函数测试区分因果方向；多变量场景下，利用QPE与得分函数的联系，以Fisher信息确定因果顺序。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在大量双变量和多变量因果发现数据集上有效。

Conclusion: QPE提供了一种不依赖噪声或机制假设的因果识别框架，扩展了现有因果模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG基础模型在临床应用中表现不佳，缺乏有效的后训练策略。

Method: 提出一种后训练方法，结合随机深度和预览线性探测等关键组件。

Result: 在PTB-XL基准测试中，宏AUROC提升1.2%-3.3%，宏AUPRC提升5.3%-20.9%，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 后训练策略能显著提升ECG基础模型性能，推动ECG领域基础模型的持续发展。

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational

Method: ReTrack采用重要性采样构建高效微调损失，保留主导项近似目标，重定向去噪轨迹至k近邻。

Result: 在MNIST T-Shirt、CelebA-HQ、CIFAR-10和Stable Diffusion上，ReTrack在遗忘强度和生成质量间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: ReTrack为扩散模型提供了高效且可解释的数据遗忘解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

Result: UTMOS和PESQ分数分别为3.74和3.45，能耗仅为ANN的14.7%。

Conclusion: Spiking Vocos在保持高性能的同时显著降低能耗，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如BPTT在训练SNNs时存在计算和内存需求高的问题，且与生物神经系统的局部性不符。局部学习规则虽解决了时间信用分配，但未能有效解决空间信用分配问题。

Method: 结合资格迹和层间对比损失，提出TP规则，无需辅助矩阵，实现了完全局部且内存高效的学习。

Result: TP在NMNIST和SHD数据集上优于其他局部规则，在复杂数据集（如DVS-GESTURE和DVS-CIFAR10）上表现竞争性，且适用于VGG-9等深层架构。

Conclusion: TP为边缘设备上的高效学习提供了可行方案，适用于实际微调任务。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

Motivation: 现有方法多关注单向SFT，忽略了多样推理模式的复杂互动，需研究双向推理对模型对齐的影响。

Method: 构建反向推理数据集r1k，对比SFT和DPO在双向推理目标下的表现。

Result: SFT在r1k上表现优于s1k，但混合数据会削弱方向区分；DPO可部分恢复区分但抑制非偏好路径。

Conclusion: 混合推理数据导致冲突信号，需开发方向感知的对齐策略以优化模型性能。

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

Conclusion: 论文建立了图谱与低通滤波器性能趋势之间的联系，提供了一种无需昂贵特征值分解即可评估图谱和性质的方法。

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely

multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the

Motivation: 现有协方差神经网络（VNNs）主要针对有限维希尔伯特空间，缺乏对无限维空间的研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出希尔伯特协方差滤波器（HVFs）和网络（HVNs），设计离散化方法，并证明其能恢复功能主成分分析（FPCA）。

Result: 在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中，HVNs表现出优于MLP和FPCA分类器的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: HVNs为无限维希尔伯特空间中的信号处理提供了有效的学习框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

Motivation: 探讨元学习在少样本任务中的价值，尤其是在有限熵、标签噪声和异构任务下的优势。

Conclusion: 元学习在特定场景下具有独特优势，MINO框架有效提升了无监督任务的性能。

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理缺失变量，且特征选择与缺失值填补过程独立，导致性能下降。

Result: 实验证明TRUST-FS优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRUST-FS通过统一框架和可信相似性图，有效解决了不完整多视图数据的特征选择问题。

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在三个数据集上表现出优越的聚类分离性、时间稳定性和与已知气候转变的一致性。

Conclusion: 该模型提升了时空聚类性能，并为气候科学应用提供了可解释的见解。

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中新知识干扰旧知识的问题，特别是参数高效微调方法在多任务和动态学习场景中的扩展性挑战。

Method: 提出分层适配器合并（HAM）框架，动态合并不同任务的适配器，通过分组、修剪、缩放和合并来优化任务管理。

Result: 在三个视觉基准测试中，HAM显著优于现有方法，尤其是在任务数量增加时表现更优。

Conclusion: HAM框架通过动态合并适配器，有效提升了持续学习的效率和扩展性，为多任务学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标记数据有限的情况下，如何高效选择训练集以平衡性能和效率是关键问题。

Method: 提出Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling (DA-FPS)方法，通过数据特征估计加权填充距离，并证明其能近似最小化该距离。

Result: 实验表明，DA-FPS相比其他采样策略显著降低了平均绝对预测误差。

Conclusion: DA-FPS是一种有效的采样方法，适用于标记数据受限的场景，能显著提升回归模型性能。

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不平衡和小数据场景中，现有方法（如过采样、焦点损失等）存在脆弱性或复杂性，需要更统一的解决方案。

Method: FOSSIL通过样本敏感重要性学习，整合了类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程、增强惩罚和预热动态。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，FOSSIL优于传统ERM、课程学习和元加权基线，且无需架构更改。

Conclusion: FOSSIL提供了一个理论支持且实用的框架，适用于多种不平衡和小数据场景。

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的联邦学习后门攻击方法OBA，利用OOD数据作为触发器和毒化样本，并设计了防御方法BNGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击依赖物理修改和可见触发器，实用性受限，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: OBA利用OOD数据作为触发器和毒化样本；SoDa通过正则化恶意模型参数提升隐蔽性；BNGuard通过检测批归一化层异常来防御。

Result: OBA能绕过现有防御并保持主任务高准确率；BNGuard能有效防御SoDa攻击。

Conclusion: OBA扩展了后门攻击场景，BNGuard为联邦学习提供了新的防御手段。

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO是一种单流策略优化方法，解决了GRPO等组基方法的缺陷，通过持久性KL自适应值跟踪器和全局优势归一化，提供更稳定、低方差的学习信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组基方法（如GRPO）存在学习信号丢失和扩展性差的问题，SPO旨在通过单流设计消除这些问题。

Method: SPO采用持久性KL自适应值跟踪器替代组基线，并在批次内全局归一化优势，避免组同步问题。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上，SPO比GRPO收敛更平滑，准确率更高，且在五个数学基准测试中平均提升3.4个百分点。

Conclusion: SPO通过基本原理而非复杂架构改进，为LLM推理提供了更稳健高效的路径。

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: LLMs通过将重复的推理片段转化为可重用的“行为”来减少推理步骤和延迟，提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多步推理中重复推导相同中间步骤的问题，以减少token使用和延迟，提高推理效率。

Method: 通过模型的元认知分析将重复推理片段转化为“行为”，存储在“行为手册”中，用于推理或监督微调。

Result: 在三种设置下均表现优异：减少推理token达46%，提高准确性10%，并更有效地将非推理模型转化为推理模型。

Conclusion: 将缓慢的推导转化为快速的行为提示，使LLMs不仅能记住结论，还能记住推理方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

TL;DR: NoRA是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过调整非线性激活函数而非权重矩阵，显著减少参数更新量（0.4%），在多个任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法主要调整权重矩阵而固定激活函数，限制了模型适应能力。NoRA旨在通过直接优化激活函数提升微调效率。

Method: NoRA将固定激活函数替换为可学习的有理函数，并采用结构化低秩更新策略，结合分组设计以提升稳定性和局部适应性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100上匹配全微调性能（仅更新0.02M参数），与LoRA结合（NoRA++）在LLaMA3-8B指令微调中MMLU平均提升0.3%-0.8%。

Conclusion: 激活函数空间调优是权重PEFT的高效补充方案，NoRA为模型适应提供了新的优化维度。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

Result: 在回归和分类任务中表现优异，匹配或超越现有方法，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且全面，适用于多种任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

Method: 提出JANUS框架，局部采用特征流形对齐策略，全局引入结构化潜变量并最大化互信息，通过强化学习优化注入过程。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上，JANUS在攻击效果和隐蔽性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JANUS通过双约束策略有效解决了隐蔽节点注入中的局部短视问题，提升了攻击性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过文本描述而非图像输入准确预测食物营养值，简化饮食监测。

Method: 使用NHANES青少年24小时饮食回忆数据，通过10-shot链式思考提示和参数高效微调（PEFT）评估LLM预测能力。

Result: 微调后模型表现显著优于原始模型，能量预测平均绝对误差降至171.34-190.90，Lin's CCC超过0.89。

Conclusion: 经链式思考提示和PEFT微调的开源LLM能准确预测饮食营养值，适用于低负担的文本饮食监测工具。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Method: 通过结构化采样和信息模糊化生成高不确定性任务，采用RFT冷启动和DUPO算法进行训练。

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，性能接近专有代理。

Conclusion: WebSailor成功缩小了开源模型与专有模型在复杂信息搜索任务中的能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.
