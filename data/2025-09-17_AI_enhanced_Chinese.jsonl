This study presents a novel machine learning methodology\nto improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond\nbreast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January\n2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of\nT1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and\nsegmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D\nvisualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined\nsegmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.\nDice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and\nground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient\ninterviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97\n($\\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and\n0.82 ($\\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate\n3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.\nClinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,\nand decision support.

We introduce Geometric\nRed-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through\nobject-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --\nstructurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger\ncatastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method\nintegrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,\nsimulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,\nand grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse\npolicy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static\nbenchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape\nexploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,\nobject-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation.

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,\nsynthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets\n(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale\nregression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a\nthresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440\nfor the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99\nrange. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in\na population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on\nISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient\ndeployment.

A common way of controlling such\nmanipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control\nparameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is\nrepresentative of the real operational con- ditions. However, when dealing with\nmanipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a\nstatic force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping\nfrom the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,\nmeasurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust\ntendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement\nor state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not\nalways accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables\ntension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.\nWe develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,\nhyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics\niterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length\nor tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a\ntraditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the\nmethod when exclusively tendon lengths are used.

Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often\nassume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are\nlearned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In\nthis work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters\nwithin the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption\nthat 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction\nnumber is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel\nPINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we\nintroduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then\npropose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss\nfunction to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral\nPINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in\nthe neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete\nepidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our\nframework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and\nextend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs\n(MPC-S-PINNs).

Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites\nprovide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a\nspatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep\nlearning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution\nover the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier\nAir-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured\nby clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual\ntemperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature\nvalues at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal\nvariations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface\ntemperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key\nEarth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive\nuncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.\nThe proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature\npixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the\ncontiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping\naccuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation.

We compare a general-purpose\nmodel (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A\nK-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known\nindividuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head\nimproved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13\npoints, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on\naveraged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is\nmore difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant\nvalidation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the\ncritical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,\nlimited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific\npre-training.

Recent\ndevelopments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is\nmore sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has\nfound PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness\nin MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show\nthat, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline\nmodel trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying\nlevels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can\nmaintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme\ndistribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in\npromoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence\nfor their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PVMs\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MBRL\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u5fae\u8c03PVMs\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f73\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff08PVMs\uff09\u5728MBRL\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2dPVMs\u5728MBRL\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728MBRL\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83PVMs\u4e0e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03PVMs\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "PVMs\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PVMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Papillary thyroid cancer\nand follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.\nFollicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more\ndifficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid\ncancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.\nWe aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a\nnovel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in\npreoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on\ncase data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University\nThird Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,\nwe improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and\nproposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between\nclinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in\ninterpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to\ncontain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were\nbenign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition\nto some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven\nthickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong\nmalignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,\nand low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of\nHashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.\nConclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular\nthyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more\naccurate diagnosis.

While VLA models have shown\nimpressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment\non resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy\nattention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA\naddresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual\ntokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and\nadopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through\nfine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens\nwhile pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby\nimproving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires\nno heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,\nmaking it compatible with modern inference frameworks.

In the second stage, the agent iteratively\npredicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and\noptimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL\nefficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail\nor likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.\nExperiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL\nbaselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training\nmethods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art\napproaches despite using a smaller model.

Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with\ncomplete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution\nof each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images\nshowcase the method's robustness and generalization capability.

This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data\nexhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label\ndependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.\nWhile most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label\nclassification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as\nmedical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address\nthis important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label\ndata with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a\ngeometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class\ncollapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class\nmeans form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we\npropose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn\nhigh-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure\napplicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain\nmultiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that\nextracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled\nclass-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which\nmitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data\ndistributions.

We\nquantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers\nof $J(\\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor\nstatistics of $J(\\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of\n$J(\\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry\noccurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The\nmotivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to\nprepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough\nabout the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely\nintervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the \"flip side\" of\nKA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather\nwatch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751fKolmogorov-Arnold\uff08KA\uff09\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u673a\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5904\u7406\u51c6\u5907\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22KA\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5355\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Jacobian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u96f6\u884c\u6570\u548c\u6b21\u8981\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316KA\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0KA\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86KA\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

A key\nbottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable\nand robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic\ninformation across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of\nExperts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability\nestimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models\nfor specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based\nor a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain\ntypes. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based\non the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers\nthree advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively\nleverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances\ngeneralization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach\nsignificantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by\nintroducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to\nminimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach\nuses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating\nnetworks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.\nExtensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and\nperformance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across\ndifferent domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average\ncomputational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path\nquality.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAVMOE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f62\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u904d\u5386\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff08NAVMOE\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "NAVMOE\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e81.2%\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\u3002", "conclusion": "NAVMOE\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

The scheduler introduces three innovative\nstrategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different\nconsistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their\ncomputed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution\ntrajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on\nthe proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the\nsolution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of\nsmoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and\nhigh-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the\napplicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation\nscenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive\nsampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through\ncomprehensive experimental evaluations.

Human operators have\nskills that need to be adapted when using machines to achieve the best results.\nIt is crucial to highlight the operator's skills and understand how they use\nand adapt them [18]. A rigorous description of these skills is necessary to\ncompare performance with and without robot assistance. Predicate logic, used by\nVergnaud within Piaget's scheme concept, offers a promising approach. However,\nthis theory doesn't account for cognitive system constraints, such as the\ntiming of actions, the limitation of cognitive resources, the parallelization\nof tasks, or the activation of automatic gestures contrary to optimal\nknowledge. Integrating these constraints is essential for representing agent\nskills understanding skill transfer between biological and mechanical\nstructures. Cognitive architectures models [2] address these needs by\ndescribing cognitive structure and can be combined with the scheme for mutual\nbenefit. Welding provides a relevant case study, as it highlights the\nchallenges faced by operators, even highly skilled ones. Welding's complexity\nstems from the need for constant skill adaptation to variable parameters like\npart position and process.

Though existing ARD\napproaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads\nto the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this\nproblem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The\ndivergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and\nrobust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and\n2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to\nperformance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key\ninnovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment\nto resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b.

Current spectral learning approaches provide only point\nestimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in\nsafety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.\nParametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine\nlearning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.\nHowever, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty\nquantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models\n(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty\nestimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational\nefficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying\nuncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail\ndue to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical\ncontributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized\nmatrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty\npropagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using\nmanifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian\nconstraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit\ndependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning.

However,\nextending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the\ncomplexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World\nModel (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into\nmodel-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,\nsequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint\ndynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential\ncommunication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its\nactions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables\nexplicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces\ncommunication overhead to linear complexity.

Extensive experiments on\nstandard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA\napproaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCOT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4dTransformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReCOT\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u5757\uff08SAM\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1160%\u3002", "conclusion": "ReCOT\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Since synthetic data is sent to the server,\nleveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework\nprotects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such\nmethods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire\nspatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with\nhigh-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is\ninspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly\ndistributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy\nconcentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like\nhigh-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus\nfiltering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our\nFedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components\nusing a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain\ndistribution alignment.

In this work, we introduce a Contextualized\nRepresentation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided\nreasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex\ninteractions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding\nit beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships\ninvolving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the\nfunctional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet\nstructures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify\ntool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable\nprompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with\ncontextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns\nlanguage with image content at both global and regional levels.

We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that\nreplaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically\nprincipled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis\ntesting (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a\ncandidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the\ncomplication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach\nto determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping\ncriterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold\n(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of\nthe simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned\nusing the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply\nremoving nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter\ntuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a\np-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into\nour framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical\nevaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree\nconsistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.\nCompared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing\nperformance.

Under this setup, we introduce the\nPrototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity\nprototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream\nlearner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic\nLearner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel\nDiffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting\ndual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),\nwhich adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively\nalign the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration\nMechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent\nsemantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets\ndemonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross various few-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "PENet\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u539f\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u548c\u539f\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u548c\u539f\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728S3DIS\u548cScanNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PENet\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u539f\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Two integration strategies are commonly\nconsidered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part\nof the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the\npolicy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical\nrelevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their\ndifferences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of\nSE-RL and SP-RL.

In\nSE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it\nmanifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through\nthe safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of\nSE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical\nanalysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role\nof action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,\nincluding a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with\nestablished SE-RL practices.

While most existing\ntrackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,\nresulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.\nFurthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by\nthe linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against\ncomplex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends\nthe SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling.

Deployed\non the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1\nFPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without\nnotable runtime overhead.

In this study, we propose a novel three-stage\ncompression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating\nsparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge\nDistillation (CWD).

SIRENs Sitzmann\net al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting\nsignals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the\nnetwork's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral\nbottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero\noutput and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its\nrepresentational capacity.

WINNER perturbs uniformly\ninitialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are\nadaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to\nrandom Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without\nintroducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape\nfitting tasks over base SIREN.

In\nthis paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with\nultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To\nmitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking\nConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate\nan amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to\nbridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\ncounterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to\neffectively transfer knowledge.

The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still\nrequires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic\ngraphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that\neigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by\nincreasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several\nstudies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic\nnetworks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that\nthe GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding\nself-loops and parallel edges.

Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,\nseveral challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data\nare limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more\ngeneral scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values\nin certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing\nmissing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two\nprocesses independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can\nresult in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of\nfeature selection.

By utilizing Subjective Logic to\nacquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates\nlearning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature\nselection and imputation.

This study focuses on parking slot detection\nusing surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the\nparking environment.

Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and\nomissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly\nincreasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these\nissues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named\nCRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather\nconditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing\ndatasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a\nhigher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking\nslots.

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS).

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls.

We validate our approach on four public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation\ntasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some\nstate-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in\ngeneralizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for\nreal-world HSI applications.

While impressive progress has been made in\ngenerating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D\nassets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose\nStyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D\nassets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous\nworks, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,\nenabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or\nboth styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a\nnovel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a\ndynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for\nstyle-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling\nstable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate\nsemantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature\nselection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of\n3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,\nallowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With\nSD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or\nboth-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we\nfurther propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables\nexclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style\nintensity control.
