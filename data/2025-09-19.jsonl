Recent advancements in reinforcement learning\n(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate\nobjectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of\ndirectly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this\nwork introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by\nincorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,\ndirectly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The\nsampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the\ndiscontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish\na unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare\nthree distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and\nparameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the\nproposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three\nobjectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves\ncompetitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.\nVideos are available at https://zhaofangguo.github.io/racing_mppi/"}

Solving it requires addressing three key\nchallenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,\nquadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of\nunknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is\nlimited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by\nlarge obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood\nof finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we\ndemonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and\nmapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging\nsettings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails.

However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous\nvariables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage\nfuture exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal\nrelationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their\nperformance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous\nvariables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework\nDAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel\ndimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables.

Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to\ndistinguish these subtle but important local differences.

Integrated Sensing and\nCommunication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.\nWithin ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses\nwireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with\nexisting communications.

Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this\ngoal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection\nmodule that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the\nVLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable\nconditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation\nstrategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using\nambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the\naction component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the\ninteraction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The\ntraining strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then\ngenerate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router\nthat helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions.

To explore the potential of perceptually motivated\ninductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions\nwell-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification\ntraining pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric\ngeometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies\nthat combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification\nobjectives.

Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity.

We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference.

ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance\nin bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be\nvisually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,\nthe proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%\nin its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods."}

In\nthis machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and\nscalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a\nbottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for\ntransitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this\ngap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from\nthe ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist\npolicies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered\narchitecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,\nfacilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and\ndependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world\nexperiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is\ntwofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design\nprinciples. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the\ndevelopment cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an\nextensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed\nlight on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

However, the optimal configuration of this network of\nsensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for\nplacing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of\nthe hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile\nfeedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand\nobject reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different\nparts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning\ncontrol policies and investigate the relationship between object\ncharacteristics and optimal sensor placement.

The methodology\ninvolves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,\nand model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,\nthey proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,\nmodels were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of\npredictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to\nguide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle\ncompetition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,\nspecifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined\nwith carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain\ngap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded\nand diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's\nhidden test set.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nmethod, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque\nfeatures from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect\nanomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)\non four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better\nperformance and is more robust to a noisy dataset.

We\nfocus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical\nimages are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle\nthis, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills\nknowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from\nscratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models\nusing pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning\nrate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and\nunlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction\naccuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate\npseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nthirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different\nsettings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,\nallowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its\nadaptability as more advanced models emerge.

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark.
