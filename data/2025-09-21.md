### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的测试时增强方法（CI-TTA），通过生成输入图像的多个变体并聚合预测结果，提升模型在未见域上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在分布偏移下性能下降严重，现有方法依赖多域训练或计算密集型测试时适应，需要更轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 采用弹性与网格变形生成输入图像的类不变变体，通过置信度引导的过滤机制聚合预测结果。

Result: 在PACS和Office-Home数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了不同DG算法和骨干网络的性能。

Conclusion: CI-TTA是一种轻量且通用的方法，能有效提升模型在未见域上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken是一个统一的视觉标记器，支持图像、视频和3D资产的高保真重建和语义理解，通过4D潜在空间和纯Transformer架构实现多模态统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标记器通常专注于单一模态的重建或理解，缺乏多模态的统一框架，AToken旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用纯Transformer架构和4D旋转位置嵌入，结合感知和Gram矩阵损失的无对抗训练目标，逐步扩展训练课程。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D任务中表现优异，如0.21 rFID和82.2% ImageNet准确率，支持多种下游应用。

Conclusion: AToken为下一代多模态AI系统提供了统一的视觉标记化基础。

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemEvo方法通过模拟人脑记忆机制，解决了增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境，实现了对新数据的快速适应和长期知识的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决增量多视图聚类中稳定性与可塑性之间的平衡问题，避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出基于海马体和前额叶皮层记忆机制的三个模块：视图对齐模块、认知遗忘机制和知识巩固模块。

Result: 实验表明，MemEvo在视图数量增长的情况下表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemEvo通过模拟人脑记忆机制，有效平衡了增量学习中的稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种边缘引导的注意力机制，通过自适应调制图提升单图像超分辨率的结构清晰度和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在融合边缘先验时存在冗余、优化不稳定或结构增益有限的问题。

Method: 结合边缘特征和中间特征激活，生成自适应调制图，用于归一化和重加权响应，同时集成到轻量级残差设计中。

Result: 在标准SISR基准测试中，结构清晰度和感知质量优于SRGAN、ESRGAN等基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过边缘条件调制，实现了参数高效、训练稳定的感知超分辨率提升。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的自适应迭代点云去噪方法，通过估计噪声变化并确定自适应去噪计划，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常多次重复去噪过程，但缺乏对不同噪声水平和模式的高效处理策略。

Method: 使用分数扩散模型，设计网络架构和两阶段采样策略，实现特征和梯度融合的迭代去噪。

Result: 在合成和真实扫描数据集上，方法在质量和定量上均优于现有方法，保留形状边界和细节更好。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应迭代去噪方法有效提升了点云去噪性能，适用于多种噪声模式。

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL利用扩散模型将视觉定位重新定义为GPS去噪任务，结合SD地图和视觉信号，实现亚米级精度，无需依赖HD地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SD地图的视觉定位方法忽视GPS噪声，而GPS在城市场景中易受多径误差影响。DiffVL旨在通过扩散模型解决这一问题。

Method: DiffVL通过扩散模型迭代去噪GPS轨迹，结合视觉BEV特征和SD地图，恢复真实位姿分布。

Result: 实验表明，DiffVL在多个数据集上达到亚米级精度，优于现有BEV匹配基线。

Conclusion: DiffVL证明扩散模型可通过将噪声GPS作为生成先验，实现可扩展的视觉定位，为传统匹配方法带来范式转变。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DICE框架通过结合扩散模型和一致性均衡，显著提升了稀疏视图CT重建的质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT重建因欠采样导致病态逆问题，传统方法难以捕捉复杂结构。扩散模型作为生成先验表现出色，但需与测量一致性结合。

Method: 提出DICE框架，通过交替执行数据一致性代理（近端算子）和先验代理（扩散模型）实现均衡。

Result: 在15、30和60视图的稀疏CT重建中，DICE显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DICE有效结合生成先验和测量一致性，提升了重建质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

### [8] [Domain Adaptation for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation Using Patient-Level Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14573)
*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督域适应方法，利用患者级诊断结果作为目标域的弱监督，通过共享聚合令牌和最大严重性三元组损失对齐跨域类别分布，提升了溃疡性结肠炎严重性估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因成像设备和临床设置的差异导致域偏移，且目标域缺乏监督或标注成本高。

Method: 利用患者级诊断结果作为弱监督，通过共享聚合令牌和最大严重性三元组损失对齐跨域类别分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在域偏移设置下优于其他域适应方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了域偏移问题，提升了溃疡性结肠炎严重性估计的准确性。

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于测试视觉语言模型在城市感知任务中的小规模基准，包含100张蒙特利尔街道图像，评估了7个模型在零样本设置下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人们对城市场景的解读可以为设计和规划提供参考，因此需要评估视觉语言模型在这类任务中的能力。

Method: 使用100张蒙特利尔街道图像（照片与合成场景各半），12名参与者提供了230份标注，评估了7个视觉语言模型在零样本设置下的表现。

Result: 模型在可见、客观属性上表现较好，主观评价上较弱；最佳模型（claude-sonnet）在多标签任务中达到宏平均0.31和平均Jaccard 0.48。

Conclusion: 研究发布了基准、提示和工具，支持可重复、不确定性感知的参与式城市分析评估。

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FMT的动态点云压缩框架，通过隐式建模连续时间变化和特征对齐，显著提升了压缩效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态点云在沉浸式现实、机器人和自动驾驶等领域广泛应用，但现有方法依赖显式运动估计，难以捕捉复杂动态和充分利用时间相关性。

Method: 采用特征对齐的运动变换（FMT）框架，用时空对齐策略替代显式运动向量，并结合随机访问（RA）参考策略实现双向运动引用和分层编码。

Result: 实验表明，FMT在编码和解码效率上优于D-DPCC和AdaDPCC，BD-Rate分别降低了20%和9.4%。

Conclusion: FMT框架有效提升了动态点云压缩的效率和性能，为相关应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridMamba结合局部和全局特征，解决了3D医学图像分割中边界模糊和区域失真的问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在3D医学图像分割中存在长距离依赖建模不足或计算开销大的问题，且过度关注全局上下文可能损害局部结构信息。

Method: 提出HybridMamba，采用双互补机制：1）特征扫描策略整合轴向遍历和局部自适应路径；2）结合空间-频率分析的门控模块。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，HybridMamba显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HybridMamba通过平衡局部和全局特征，提升了3D医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

### [12] [Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610)
*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态跳跃连接（DSC）块，通过自适应机制增强跨层连接，解决了传统跳跃连接的静态特征融合和多尺度特征交互不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跳跃连接存在静态特征融合和多尺度特征交互不足的局限性，限制了医学图像分割的性能。

Method: DSC块包含两个模块：测试时间训练（TTT）模块用于动态适应隐藏表示，动态多尺度核（DMSK）模块用于自适应选择核大小。

Result: 实验表明DSC块在多种U型网络中均表现出即插即用的有效性。

Conclusion: DSC块通过自适应机制显著提升了跨层连接的效果，适用于多种网络架构。

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决骨架动作识别中标记样本稀缺和短长期时序依赖建模的挑战。

Method: 提出LSTC模块并行处理短长期特征，并通过自适应融合保留关键信息；扩展JMDA数据增强技术，限制同视角混合以避免分布偏移。

Result: 在NTU 60、NTU 120和NW-UCLA数据集上达到最优性能（如94.1%、97.5%等）。

Conclusion: LSTC-MDA通过改进时序建模和数据多样性，显著提升了骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令式图像编辑方法因数据集编辑类型和样本数量有限而表现不佳，且传统数据集构建存在噪声和偏见。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型生成视觉自适应编辑指令和高保真编辑图像，构建高质量数据集。

Result: 实验表明，使用MultiEdit微调模型显著提升了复杂编辑任务的性能，同时保持标准编辑任务的能力。

Conclusion: MultiEdit为研究多样化和挑战性指令式图像编辑提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏适应性而难以应用于复杂模型，需要一种既能生成解释又能部分更新参数的方法。

Method: 引入Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA)和Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA)机制，ALA简化层选择，AEA交替更新参数。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉基础模型的解释生成能力和适应性，解决了注意力区域过小的问题。

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

TL;DR: DACoN框架利用基础模型和CNN融合特征，解决了线稿自动上色中的遮挡和视角变化问题，支持多参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少手绘动画制作的劳动成本，解决现有方法在遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化中的不足。

Method: 结合基础模型的低分辨率语义特征和CNN的高分辨率空间特征，支持任意数量参考图像。

Result: 定量和定性评估显示，使用多参考图像提升了上色性能。

Conclusion: DACoN通过多参考图像和特征融合，实现了更优的线稿自动上色效果。

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available
at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.

TL;DR: FMGS-Avatar通过结合Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting和基础模型，提升了单目视频中3D人体化身的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目视频中几何信息不足，导致重建高保真动画人体化身困难。现有3D高斯方法因自由形态特性难以保留表面细节。

Method: 提出FMGS-Avatar，结合Mesh-Guided 2D高斯方法和基础模型知识，采用选择性梯度隔离协调训练策略。

Result: 实验显示在几何精度和外观保真度上优于现有方法，并能提供丰富的语义信息。

Conclusion: FMGS-Avatar通过增强表示和协调信息蒸馏，显著提升了3D单目人体化身重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Conclusion: CoTRR方法通过直接利用多模态大语言模型的推理能力，显著提升了图像检索的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

Conclusion: 扩散模型的大规模预训练为标注稀缺领域的检测任务提供了有效解决方案，且在小数据量下表现良好。

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

Conclusion: 开源基准测试代码，呼吁未来研究采用标准化的帧采样策略。

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时性和高精度之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型分割点云，平面和曲面分别拟合，并采用2D体素边界描述。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证，效率提升3.78倍，精度比高斯混合模型提高2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和准确性上均优于现有技术，适用于低功耗设备。

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

Motivation: 解决现有GAN反转数据蒸馏方法依赖预训练模型和类别信息的问题，提升通用性和适用性。

Method: 提取高梯度图像块，基于CLIP特征分类，用扩散模型学习分布并合成蒸馏图像。

Result: 仅用0.68%原始数据训练，性能仅下降0.3 dB，扩散模型微调4小时，SR模型训练1小时。

Conclusion: 新方法在数据效率和计算时间上优于现有技术，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Conclusion: Report2CT通过完整报告和多编码器条件，推动了3D CT合成的临床保真度和质量。

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

Result: 在骨盆和踝关节分割实验中表现准确、稳定且一致，解决了传统问题。

Conclusion: 算法结合领域知识与深度神经网络，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Result: 在不损害重建精度和拓扑正确性的前提下，显著提高了训练的一致性和可重复性。

Conclusion: MED损失函数有效解决了学习型CSR中的变形优化问题，为未来的研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX在骨健康分类中表现出色，同时提供可理解的解释，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their

digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic

Conclusion: 该框架为超分辨率模型提供了一种通用且高效的噪声过拟合解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers

Vision Transformers from arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate
claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution

environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

Result: 在四个数据集上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体视觉推理能实现更鲁棒和可解释的图像分类。

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

### [32] [Temporal Representation Learning of Phenotype Trajectories for pCR Prediction in Breast Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14872)
*Ivana Janíčková,Yen Y. Tan,Thomas H. Helbich,Konstantin Miloserdov,Zsuzsanna Bago-Horvath,Ulrike Heber,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从影像数据中学习治疗早期动态表示的方法，用于预测乳腺癌患者对新辅助化疗的病理完全缓解（pCR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体化治疗决策需要预测患者对治疗的反应，但由于疾病进展和治疗反应的差异性，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 通过分析乳腺癌MRI数据的纵向变化，构建潜在空间中的轨迹，并利用多任务模型捕捉外观特征、时间连续性及非响应者的高异质性。

Result: 在ISPY-2数据集上，仅使用治疗前数据（T0）的平衡准确率为0.761，加入早期响应数据（T0 + T1）后提升至0.811，使用四个时间点数据（T0 -> T3）后达到0.861。

Conclusion: 该方法通过潜在轨迹空间有效预测治疗反应，为个体化治疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可视化3D视觉线索的方法，用于理解航天器姿态估计网络的决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据驱动的航天器姿态估计方法在实际任务中因决策过程不透明而难以应用的问题。

Method: 通过训练基于NeRF的图像生成器，利用姿态估计网络的梯度回传来可视化其依赖的3D特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效恢复姿态估计网络依赖的3D线索，并揭示其与目标航天器隐式表示的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解姿态估计网络的决策提供了新视角，有助于推动其在真实任务中的应用。

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SAM2框架的复杂视频对象分割方法，通过伪标签训练和级联多模型推理，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂视频对象分割（VOS）面临小目标、频繁遮挡、快速运动和复杂交互等挑战，需要更鲁棒和准确的方法。

Method: 采用伪标签策略训练SAM2Long框架，并结合SeC模型进行级联推理，动态整合两者的输出。

Result: 在MOSE测试集上J&F得分达到0.8616，比基线提升1.4分，获得LSVOS 2025 VOS赛道第二名。

Conclusion: 该方法在长复杂视频分割场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

*Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP模型在微调后可能因过度专业化而丧失跨领域泛化能力，尤其是复杂任务（如人脸识别）表现更明显。模型容量越大，保留的原始泛化能力越强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CLIP模型在微调为高度专业化任务（如人脸识别、攻击检测）时，是否丧失其跨领域泛化能力。

Method: 评估三个微调后的CLIP模型及原始CLIP在14个通用视觉数据集和专业化任务上的表现，分析任务复杂性和分类头设计的影响。

Result: 微调模型在专业化任务上表现优异（如FRoundation模型在IJB-C上提升58.52%），但在通用任务（如ImageNetV2）上性能显著下降（从69.84%降至51.63%）。

Conclusion: 模型微调会导致过度专业化，任务复杂性和分类头设计影响遗忘程度，更大的模型容量有助于缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DF-LLaVA框架结合MLLMs的潜在知识，提升合成图像检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测模型仅提供简单的真实性分类，缺乏解释性；MLLM方法虽可解释但准确性不足。

Method: 提取MLLMs的潜在知识并通过提示注入训练，提升LLaVA的检测能力。

Result: DF-LLaVA在准确性和可解释性上均优于专家模型。

Conclusion: DF-LLaVA实现了高准确性和可解释性的合成图像检测。

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Motivation: 现有3D增量学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，主要由于几何错位和纹理偏差，导致语义模糊和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出了Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR)框架，包括结构感知几何校正模块和纹理放大模块，并通过基础-新颖判别器稳定增量原型。

Conclusion: CMGR框架有效解决了3D增量学习中的几何和纹理问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Result: 在两个大型fMRI数据集上，Brain-HGCN在精神病分类任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲GNN在计算精神病学领域具有巨大潜力，开创了fMRI分析的新范式。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoboEye是一个两阶段识别框架，结合2D语义特征和3D推理，提升电商仓库中物品识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商产品类别快速增长导致物品识别困难，传统2D方法因类内变异性、长尾物品等问题性能下降。

Method: 第一阶段用大视觉模型提取2D特征生成候选排名；第二阶段通过3D特征质量评估和关键点匹配进行重排序。

Result: RoboEye在Recall@1上比现有技术（RoboLLM）提升7.1%，且仅需RGB图像，降低部署成本。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过结合2D和3D特征，显著提升了物品识别性能，适用于复杂电商场景。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖随机掩码，忽略了几何结构和语义一致性，无法捕捉跨方向的空间关系和语义对象部分。

Method: 采用双流掩码策略：3D空间网格掩码通过坐标排序捕捉几何关系，渐进语义掩码通过注意力驱动聚类保持语义一致性。

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和OmniObject3D数据集上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需架构改动即可集成到现有框架中，显著提升了旋转不变性任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Conclusion: EchoVLM显著提升了超声诊断准确性，为未来临床应用提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

Motivation: 传统方法在区分视觉相似但品牌不同的产品时表现不佳，PRISM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分三阶段：1) 使用SigLIP模型初步筛选；2) 用YOLO-E去除背景干扰；3) 通过LightGlue进行像素级匹配。

Result: 在ABV数据集上，PRISM的top-1准确率比现有方法高4.21%，且保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过混合方法显著提升了产品检索的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

Abstract: In the realm of fully autonomous drones, the accurate detection of obstacles
is paramount to ensure safe navigation and prevent collisions. Among these
challenges, the detection of wires stands out due to their slender profile,
which poses a unique and intricate problem. To address this issue, we present
an innovative solution in the form of a monocular end-to-end model for wire

estimation. Our results underscore the potential of our model to enhance the

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了搜索时间和计算开销，优于现有暴力调参方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了扩散模型在图像编辑中的实用性，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

TL;DR: RynnVLA-001是一个基于大规模视频生成预训练的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过两阶段预训练方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过视频生成预训练和动作轨迹预测，有效连接视觉帧预测与动作预测，提升模型初始化效果。

Result: 在相同下游机器人数据集上微调后，性能优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段预训练策略为VLA模型提供了更有效的初始化方法。

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Motivation: 解决合成数据训练模型在真实场景中性能不佳的问题，探索仅用合成数据训练的有效性。

Method: 采用YOLOv11模型，结合数据增强、数据集多样化和模型缩放，通过定性和定量评估优化模型。

Result: 最佳配置的YOLOv11l模型在Kaggle竞赛中达到0.910的mAP@50，显示合成数据训练的潜力。

Conclusion: 合成数据训练可有效缩小域差距，但仍需解决真实世界多样性的挑战。

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

Conclusion: 首次整合视觉-定位投影去噪视线外物体轨迹，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

Motivation: 确定深度学习肺分割模型在不同疾病严重程度、病理类型和肺侧的适用性，以支持肺移植术前规划。

Method: 回顾性研究32例患者，使用三种模型（Unet-R231、TotalSegmentator、MedSAM）进行肺分割，通过定量和定性指标评估性能。

Result: Unet-R231整体表现最优，但所有模型在中重度病例中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需针对严重病理情况优化模型，Unet-R231和TotalSegmentator可作为首选，但需进一步改进。

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅需单RGB视频即可优化动态场景中相机参数的新方法，通过Patch-wise Tracking Filters、Outlier-aware Joint Optimization和Two-stage Optimization Strategy实现高效准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COLMAP在动态场景中依赖GT运动掩码且耗时，现有方法需额外先验信息，而实际RGB视频中这些信息通常缺失。

Method: 结合Patch-wise Tracking Filters建立稀疏关系、Outlier-aware Joint Optimization自适应降权移动异常点、Two-stage Optimization Strategy平衡Softplus限制与凸损失最小值。

Result: 在5个数据集上验证，仅用单RGB视频即可更高效准确地估计相机参数。

Conclusion: 新方法在动态场景中无需额外先验，仅凭RGB视频即可实现优于COLMAP的相机参数优化。

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with

stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external
factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage
self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of
pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward,
underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning
for trustworthy medical AI. Codes are released at

Conclusion: 感知驱动的归纳偏置可提升视觉模型性能，为模型设计提供新方向。

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统依赖外部检索来提高准确性，但现有攻击主要针对用户查询，忽略了指令提示这一更隐蔽的攻击面。

Method: 提出AIP攻击，利用对抗性指令提示操纵检索行为，采用多样化查询生成和遗传算法优化攻击效果。

Result: 实验显示AIP攻击成功率高达95.23%，同时保持良性功能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RAG系统中指令提示的潜在风险，呼吁重新评估共享指令提示的安全性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

Conclusion: M&N通过知识蒸馏和动态采样策略，显著提升了半监督3D医学图像分割的性能和适应性。

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有面部老化模型存在种族偏见，且亲子照片年龄差异大，影响验证效果。

Method: RA-GAN包含RACEpSp和特征混合器模块，生成无种族偏见的合成图像。

Result: RA-GAN在种族准确性和身份保留上优于SAM-GAN和CUSP-GAN，显著提升了亲子关系验证的准确性。

Conclusion: RA-GAN通过消除种族偏见和年龄差异，显著提升了亲子关系验证的准确性。

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

Motivation: 探索MLLMs在STVG任务中的零样本能力，解决其因未能充分整合文本查询线索而导致的次优定位问题。

Method: 提出DSTH策略，将查询分解为属性和动作子查询，并通过LRA模块学习空间和时间提示；引入TAS策略增强时间一致性。

Conclusion: 通过DSTH和TAS策略，MLLMs在零样本STVG任务中表现出色，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业需要高效的玉米幼苗检测方法，但现有数据集稀缺，传统方法效率低且易出错。

Method: 提出MSDD数据集，包含单株、双株和三株玉米幼苗的多样场景，并测试了YOLO系列模型的性能。

Result: YOLOv9在单株检测中精度最高（0.984），但多株检测因稀有性和不规则性表现较差。YOLO11速度最快（35ms/图）。

Conclusion: MSDD为开发高效幼苗计数模型奠定了基础，推动了精准农业的自动化监测。

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自监督训练框架ST-AR，解决了自回归模型在视觉领域的三个关键问题，显著提升了图像理解和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉领域面临局部依赖、语义不一致和空间不变性不足等问题，限制了其图像理解能力。

Method: 通过引入自监督目标，提出了ST-AR训练框架，无需依赖预训练表示模型。

Result: ST-AR显著提升了自回归模型的图像理解能力，LlamaGen-L和LlamaGen-XL的FID分别提升了42%和49%。

Conclusion: ST-AR框架有效解决了自回归模型在视觉领域的局限性，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

TL;DR: SyncSeal是一种定制水印方法，用于增强现有水印方法对几何变换的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像在几何变换（如裁剪、旋转）下的同步问题，提升水印方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用嵌入网络和提取网络进行端到端训练，结合判别器保持图像质量。

Result: 实验证明SyncSeal能准确同步图像，并提升现有水印方法对几何变换的抵抗力。

Conclusion: SyncSeal有效提升了水印方法在几何变换下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MVS方法在计算效率上存在不足，扩散模型在生成任务中的成功启发了其在MVS中的应用。

Method: 将深度优化建模为条件扩散过程，设计条件编码器引导扩散，结合轻量级2D U-Net和卷积GRU，提出基于置信度的采样策略。

Result: DiffMVS在运行时间和GPU内存上具有竞争力，CasDiffMVS在多个数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在MVS中表现出色，新框架在效率和性能上均有显著提升。

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and
ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs.

TL;DR: ScaleCUA提出了一种大规模开源计算机使用数据集和模型，显著提升了跨平台GUI操作的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在计算机使用代理（CUAs）中潜力巨大，但缺乏大规模开源数据和基础模型限制了进展。

Method: 通过闭环管道结合自动化代理与人类专家，构建了跨6个操作系统和3个任务领域的大规模数据集，并训练了ScaleCUA模型。

Result: ScaleCUA在多个基准测试中表现优异（如WebArena-Lite-v2提升26.6分），并创下新纪录（如MMBench-GUI L1-Hard达94.4%）。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的规模化是提升通用计算机使用代理性能的关键，ScaleCUA的数据、模型和代码将开源以推动研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that
operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by
the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models.
In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It
offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains,
built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts.
Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across
platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on

results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on
WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling
for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code

Motivation: 事件相机数据缺乏大规模密集深度标注，限制了基于学习的单目深度估计。

Method: 提出跨模态蒸馏范式，利用空间对齐的RGB帧和事件流，结合视觉基础模型（如Depth Anything v2）或其改进的循环架构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，跨模态方法性能接近全监督方法，且无需昂贵标注；基于视觉基础模型的方案达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 跨模态蒸馏和视觉基础模型有效解决了事件相机深度估计的标注问题，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing
computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection
mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory
requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach
achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and
demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting
a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

TL;DR: CalibPrompt是一个用于在提示调优过程中校准医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）置信度的框架，旨在解决模型预测的校准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在医学影像任务中表现出色，但其置信度校准未被充分探索，可能导致过度自信的错误预测，影响临床决策的可靠性。

Method: CalibPrompt通过优化一组可学习的提示，结合平滑准确率对齐和角度分离损失，提升多模态Med-VLMs的置信度估计可靠性。

Result: 在四个Med-VLMs和五个医学影像数据集上的实验表明，CalibPrompt显著改善了校准效果，同时保持了较高的准确率。

Conclusion: CalibPrompt为Med-VLMs的置信度校准提供了一种有效方法，有助于提升临床决策的可靠性。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）的复杂性和自主性增加，但缺乏大规模、多样化的错误标注数据集，阻碍了可靠性研究。

Method: 使用基于LLM的自适应操纵器，注入可控错误（如提示注入和响应破坏），生成多样化错误数据集。

Result: 在监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种范式下，AEGIS数据训练的模型性能显著提升，部分模型优于大型专有系统。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发更鲁棒和可解释的多智能体系统提供了关键资源。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架在BEV表示中缺乏对风险和语义先验的显式建模，导致规划不够安全和可解释。

Method: FlowDrive引入物理可解释的能量流场（如风险势场和车道吸引场），并结合条件扩散规划器解耦运动意图预测和轨迹去噪。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中，FlowDrive以86.3的EPDMS分数达到SOTA性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式建模流场特征，实现了更安全和可解释的运动规划，同时提升了多模态轨迹生成的多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is

Result: 在2-10个机器人团队中展示了鲁棒的运输能力，并实现了轻量物体的仿真到现实迁移。

Conclusion: 通过奖励设计和训练课程，机器人能够模拟刚性连接行为，实现无通信的协调运输。

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous

diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a

prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that

Result: 在多足导航和双臂操作任务中展示了学习复杂协调行为的能力，并在真实硬件实验中验证了导航策略。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过基础模型的规划与优化能力，有效解决了多机器人协调任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

TL;DR: RLBind是一个两阶段对抗不变性跨模态对齐框架，旨在提升统一多模态编码器的鲁棒性，适用于机器人感知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人部署中视觉分支易受对抗性和自然损坏影响，现有防御方法通常忽视跨模态对应关系，导致鲁棒性和零样本迁移性能有限。

Method: RLBind分为两阶段：1) 无监督微调以强化视觉编码器；2) 利用跨模态对应关系，最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点的差异，并强制跨模态的类别分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的实验表明，RLBind在干净准确性和对抗鲁棒性上均优于LanguageBind基线和标准微调方法。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提升了鲁棒性，为机器人导航和操作等任务提供了更安全的多传感器感知方案。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

Method: 结合轻量级视觉感知和大型语言模型（LLM）推理，将手势转换为结构化文本描述，由LLM推断意图并生成机器人特定命令。

Result: 系统实现了上下文感知的自适应控制，无需用户明确指定目标或命令。

Conclusion: GestOS通过智能编排手势交互，支持动态环境中可扩展、灵活且用户友好的机器人协作。

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

### [77] [Perception-Integrated Safety Critical Control via Analytic Collision Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14421)
*Dario Tscholl,Yashwanth Nakka,Brian Gunter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯溅射的感知驱动安全过滤器，通过碰撞锥和控制屏障函数实现高效、平滑的避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统距离控制屏障函数反应滞后、计算成本高的问题，提升机器人在复杂环境中的实时避障能力。

Method: 将3D高斯溅射转化为闭合形式的碰撞锥，并嵌入二次规划中，形成控制屏障函数。

Result: 在包含17万溅射的场景中，规划时间减少3倍，轨迹抖动显著降低，同时保持安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需高阶扩展，适用于实时导航，特别适合空间机器人和卫星系统等极端环境。

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

TL;DR: LEGO框架通过图神经网络和规范化技术提升多智能体强化学习的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习在竞争环境中训练不稳定、非动力学对策失效及泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 结合图神经网络（捕捉置换等变性）、规范化（实现E(n)-等变性）和异构表示（编码角色特定偏置）。

Result: 在合作与竞争任务中优于基线，泛化能力提升，且对团队规模和智能体失效具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LEGO为复杂多智能体任务提供了稳定且泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在监督控制环境中，智能体如何在非连续监控下通过欺骗行为实现私人目标，同时保持与监督者参考策略的表面合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受现实人类监督行为的启发，研究如何利用心智理论（Theory of Mind）指导在线强化学习（RL）实现欺骗行为。

Method: 通过建模监督者的期望，提取一个标量（预期偏差证据），并将其作为状态依赖权重注入KL正则化的策略改进步骤中。

Conclusion: 研究表明，心智理论可以有效地指导在线强化学习实现欺骗行为，同时保持表面合规性。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

<details>

Motivation: 人类能够高效地通过高层次抽象进行推理，而机器人通常需要手工设计抽象结构，限制了其可扩展性和适用性。

Method: 结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，从原始图像中诱导离散的图结构抽象。

Result: 在模拟的重排任务中，该方法能一致地识别出有意义的抽象结构，支持高效规划，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自主地从视觉数据中发现抽象结构，为机器人规划提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

Method: 通过消融研究，比较了ResNet50、GoogLeNet以及3层和5层卷积神经网络（CNN）结构的性能。

Result: 实验表明，机器学习能够有效从触觉图像中提取信息，提升软体机器人的任务表现。

Conclusion: 机器学习是一种有前景的技术，能够帮助软体机器人更好地理解和与环境互动。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

Motivation: 解决事件定位研究中代码依赖和数据格式多样化带来的比较困难问题。

Result: 框架能系统化分析和可视化结果，揭示事件收集参数对性能的影响。

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了公平比较方法的能力，简化了多条件设置流程。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

Motivation: 草莓自然生长在密集的簇中，容易被叶片、茎和其他果实遮挡，传统机器人采摘系统难以应对这种复杂环境。

Method: 系统采用4自由度SCARA机械臂和人类遥操作接口收集数据，并利用改进的End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT)算法训练精细的视觉运动采摘策略。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的方法在多种遮挡场景下显著优于直接使用ACT算法。

Conclusion: 该系统在遮挡草莓采摘中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Result: 规划时间减少80.4%，路径点减少89.4%，并在物理实验中完成完整工作流程。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了复杂实验室自动化任务的效率和实用性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，RTE比之前BEV方法提升40%。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2框架显著提升了性能，并公开了新数据集ZJH-VO以促进研究。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 该方法在嵌入式机器人感知中实现了高效和实时性能，适用于多种3D任务。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between

RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

present exUMI, an extensible data collection device that enhances the vanilla
UMI with robust proprioception (via AR MoCap and rotary encoder), modular
visuo-tactile sensing, and automated calibration, achieving 100% data
usability. Building on an efficient collection of over 1 M tactile frames, we
propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation learning
framework through action-aware temporal tactile prediction, capturing contact
dynamics and mitigating tactile sparsity. Real-world experiments show that TPP
outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap
between human tactile intuition and robot learning through co-designed hardware
and algorithms, offering open-source resources to advance contact-rich
manipulation research. Project page: https://silicx.github.io/exUMI.

TL;DR: 本文重新分析了一个三环空间连杆机构，发现其在参考配置下具有有限自由度3（过约束），但微分自由度为5。机构构型空间局部为光滑流形，且微分自由度局部恒定，表明机构是松动的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新研究一个由Karl Wohlhart提出的三环连杆机构，以验证其自由度和构型空间特性，特别是其过约束和松动的性质。

Method: 通过局部分析，计算运动学切锥和构型空间的局部近似，验证机构的自由度和构型空间特性。

Result: 机构在参考配置下具有有限自由度3，微分自由度为5，构型空间局部为光滑流形，且微分自由度局部恒定。

Conclusion: 该三环连杆机构是过约束且松动的，其参考配置并非构型空间奇异点。

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MPPI的无参考轨迹方法，通过直接优化门进度目标，在无人机竞速中实现了与参考方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的控制器依赖预计算的参考轨迹，而强化学习发现这些控制器优化的是替代目标（如轨迹跟踪）而非直接最大化门进度。

Method: 将门进度目标（源自RL奖励塑造）直接纳入MPPI框架，利用其采样特性优化非连续、不可微的目标。

Result: 提出的无参考方法在竞速性能上与传统参考方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 无参考方法通过直接优化门进度目标，在实时性和性能上表现出色，为无人机竞速提供了新思路。

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

TL;DR: 研究了非语言沟通（如LED信号和情感显示）对人机协作的影响，发现情感显示虽增加互动感，但对任务表现提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在共享工作空间中，有效沟通对安全和效率至关重要，探索非语言沟通对人机交互的作用。

Method: 在Franka Emika Panda机器人上集成LED灯带和动画面部显示，通过颜色信号和表情传达意图，进行18人参与的实验。

Result: 情感显示增加了互动感，但对碰撞预期、沟通清晰度和任务效率无显著提升。

Conclusion: 情感线索可增强用户参与度，但对共享工作空间中的任务表现影响有限。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Conclusion: PVRs在视觉安全过滤器中具有潜力，但需权衡训练策略和实际部署的复杂性，未来研究可进一步优化其性能和适用性。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Motivation: 受限和杂乱环境中的操作因部分可观测性和复杂配置空间而具有挑战性，需智能探索策略。

Conclusion: COMPASS在受限环境中表现优异，显著提升操作成功率。

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

TL;DR: GCR-PPO是一种改进的强化学习方法，通过分解目标梯度并基于优先级解决冲突，提高了多任务RL的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL控制器将多目标聚合为单一标量奖励，导致调优成本高且易陷入局部最优，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 提出GCR-PPO，使用多头评论家分解目标梯度，并根据优先级解决冲突。

Result: 在IsaacLab基准测试中，GCR-PPO比并行PPO性能提升9.5%，高冲突任务表现更优。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO在多目标RL中表现出更高的可扩展性和性能，尤其适用于高冲突任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Conclusion: CollabVLA是VLA向协作助手发展的开创性工作，具备推理、行动和与人类协作的能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

TL;DR: PERAL框架通过被动激发LiDAR扫描，提升球形机器人在特征稀缺环境中的性能，无需额外硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水平安装LiDAR在近地面扫描不足的问题，避免传统方法的硬件成本和性能牺牲。

Method: 利用内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合模型，叠加非周期性振荡运动，丰富垂直扫描多样性。

Result: 实验显示地图完整性达96%，轨迹跟踪误差减少27%，且重量、功耗和成本更低。

Conclusion: PERAL是一种高效、低成本且无需额外硬件的解决方案，适用于球形机器人。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RCS填补了机器人学习研究中的工具空白，支持大规模训练和真实实验，并展示了仿真数据对真实策略性能的提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained

(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

Conclusion: 连通性感知图和全局路径规划器对性能提升至关重要，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the

TL;DR: PA-MPPI方法通过感知感知优化解决了未知环境中四旋翼导航的探索问题，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四旋翼在未知环境中导航时因障碍物遮挡导致探索能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出感知感知MPPI（PA-MPPI），通过在线调整轨迹以感知未知区域。

Result: 硬件实验显示PA-MPPI性能比基线提升100%，适用于导航基础模型。

Conclusion: PA-MPPI有效解决了未知环境中的导航挑战，提升了四旋翼的探索能力和安全性。

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视图方法视野受限、探索能力不足，以及传统控制器在奇异点附近效率低的问题。

Method: 采用多视图扩散策略生成任务相关目标，结合ReM-QP控制器高效执行。

Result: 实验显示成功率提高7-56%，碰撞减少3-31%。

Conclusion: M4Diffuser在非结构化环境中表现出色，为可靠移动操作铺平道路。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Conclusion: 结论为仿人末端执行器的设计和优化提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

TL;DR: ExT框架通过大规模演示数据预训练和微调，实现了自主挖掘机的多任务策略，展示了从仿真到实际机器的成功迁移和快速适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主挖掘机系统依赖高度工程化的控制器，难以适应新场景，而大规模预训练模型在其他领域表现出色，但在重型机械中的应用尚未探索。

Method: ExT框架结合大规模演示数据预训练和微调（SFT或RLFT），支持多任务策略的快速适应。

Result: ExT策略在仿真和实际实验中表现出厘米级精度，并能快速适应新任务和机器配置。

Conclusion: ExT为可扩展和通用的自主挖掘机系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模动态环境中表现出高可靠性和实用价值。

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Result: 在随机任务和真实模拟中验证了算法的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: 方法能高效建模复杂任务并生成高质量任务计划。

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Result: 在8个真实任务中表现优于现有VLA方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发协作型具身代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星探测车需在混合能源（RTG和太阳能）下长时间运行，现有规划方法未充分考虑能量可行性。

Method: 整合物理模型和子系统负载，将累积能量预算和瞬时功率约束纳入SE(2)多项式轨迹优化。

Result: 在月球类似地形中，规划器生成的轨迹峰值功率仅超出限制0.55%，而现有方法超出17%。

Conclusion: 该方法为长期行星任务提供了一种实用且原则性的能量感知自主规划方案。

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法AnoF-Diff，用于从时间序列数据中提取力-扭矩特征并检测异常，在噪声数据中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理真实世界中的噪声、非平稳和多任务数据时效果不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的异常检测方法。

Method: 基于扩散模型提取力-扭矩特征，并采用并行异常评分评估方法进行在线异常检测。

Result: 在四个任务中，AnoF-Diff在F1-score和AUROC指标上优于其他方法，且对噪声数据更鲁棒。

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff是一种有效的异常检测方法，适用于多任务和噪声环境，并支持在线检测。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Conclusion: 优化设计在障碍物丰富的环境中成功部署，证明了框架的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.

Conclusion: 上下文学习对神经定理证明有效，框架展示了LLMs在数学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem
proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In
this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose
Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical
conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is
that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including
previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of
more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without
changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered
theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers
and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not
be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language,
which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

Motivation: 探索DNNs在科学计算中的应用潜力，特别是在处理复杂物理系统时的表现。

Method: 通过系统实验，评估不同激活函数、网络深度、宽度和训练方法对收敛特性的影响。

Result: tanh激活函数表现稳定，sin激活函数在某些情况下误差更低但可能产生非物理伪影；DNNs在优化配置下与传统数值方法竞争。

Conclusion: DNNs在科学计算中具有潜力，但标准前馈架构在处理不连续解时存在固有局限性，需进一步研究突破。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络在二元正确/错误监督下学习置信度估计的根本限制。

Method: 通过数学分析和实验验证（包括负奖励训练、对称损失函数和后校准方法）。

Result: 实验显示所有方法均失败，后校准虽部分成功但通过压缩置信度分布实现。

Conclusion: 提出新的监督范式（如集成不一致性和自适应多智能体学习）以突破限制。

Abstract: We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: neural networks cannot
simultaneously learn well-calibrated confidence estimates with meaningful
diversity when trained using binary correct/incorrect supervision. Through
rigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning
negative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration
methods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a
methodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:
negative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while
destroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to
escape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE
less than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize
this as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot
distinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60
percent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent
confident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure
rate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while
post-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our
theorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.
This impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and
establishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely
convenient. We propose novel supervision paradigms using ensemble disagreement
and adaptive multi-agent learning that could overcome these fundamental
limitations without requiring human confidence annotations.

Motivation: 扩展LLM上下文窗口对长范围任务至关重要，但RoPE插值与量化结合会因多种效应导致精度下降。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法，通过频带分组和搜索RoPE维度尺度，无需微调或架构改动。

Result: Q-ROAR在标准任务中恢复0.7%精度，GovReport困惑度降低10%以上，且保持短上下文性能。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR有效解决了插值与量化的耦合问题，兼容现有推理框架。

Abstract: Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based
position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling
extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ)
enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades
accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation,
axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit
noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce
two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity)
and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To
address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that
groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search
over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to
preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context
dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes.
Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces
GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context
performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.

Abstract: Information retrieval with compact binary embeddings, also referred to as

introduce Hashing-Baseline, a strong training-free hashing method leveraging
powerful pretrained encoders that produce rich pretrained embeddings. We
revisit classical, training-free hashing techniques: principal component
analysis, random orthogonal projection, and threshold binarization, to produce
a strong baseline for hashing. Our approach combines these techniques with
frozen embeddings from state-of-the-art vision and audio encoders to yield
competitive retrieval performance without any additional learning or
fine-tuning. To demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach,
we evaluate it on standard image retrieval benchmarks as well as a newly
introduced benchmark for audio hashing.

*Herlock,Rahimi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAVOT通过最优传输解决联邦学习中客户端参与不均衡问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端参与分布与优化目标分布不一致，导致FedAvg更新偏差和不稳定。

Method: 提出FedAVOT，将聚合建模为掩码最优传输问题，使用Sinkhorn缩放计算权重。

Result: 在非光滑凸FL设置下实现标准收敛率，实验显示性能显著优于FedAvg。

Conclusion: FedAVOT在异构、公平敏感和低参与场景下表现优异，即使每轮仅两个客户端参与。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training without sharing raw
data, but suffers when client participation is partial. In practice, the
distribution of available users (\emph{availability distribution} $q$) rarely
aligns with the distribution defining the optimization objective
(\emph{importance distribution} $p$), leading to biased and unstable updates
under classical FedAvg. We propose \textbf{Fereated AVerage with Optimal
Transport (\textbf{FedAVOT})}, which formulates aggregation as a masked optimal
transport problem aligning $q$ and $p$. Using Sinkhorn scaling,
\textbf{FedAVOT} computes transport-based aggregation weights with provable
convergence guarantees. \textbf{FedAVOT} achieves a standard
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent
of the number of participating users per round. Our experiments confirm
drastically improved performance compared to FedAvg across heterogeneous,
fairness-sensitive, and low-availability regimes, even when only two clients
participate per round.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级异常检测算法H-Alpha Anomalyzer，用于处理GONG网络的Hα观测数据，优于现有方法且具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着天文观测数据的爆炸式增长，确保输入机器学习模型的数据质量至关重要。

Method: 设计了一种非机器学习的轻量级异常检测算法，基于用户定义标准识别异常观测，并量化异常可能性。

Result: 算法在2000个观测数据集中表现优于现有方法，并提供可解释性。

Conclusion: H-Alpha Anomalyzer不仅高效，还能帮助领域专家进行定性评估。

Abstract: The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided
astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be
processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring
the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.

*Ying Lin,Yao Kuang,Ahmet Alacaoglu,Michael P. Friedlander*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种随机局部协调方法，减少分布式优化中的通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式优化中全同步通信开销大的问题。

Method: 每个节点独立随机采样一个正则项，仅与共享该正则项的节点协调。

Result: 在凸目标下达到$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$迭代次数，强凸性下达到$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$或$\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$收敛。

Conclusion: 随机局部协调方法在保持收敛性的同时显著降低了通信需求。

Abstract: Distributed optimization requires nodes to coordinate, yet full
synchronization scales poorly. When $n$ nodes collaborate through $m$ pairwise
regularizers, standard methods demand $\mathcal{O}(m)$ communications per
iteration. This paper proposes randomized local coordination: each node
independently samples one regularizer uniformly and coordinates only with nodes
sharing that term. This exploits partial separability, where each regularizer
$G_j$ depends on a subset $S_j \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of nodes. For
graph-guided regularizers where $|S_j|=2$, expected communication drops to
exactly 2 messages per iteration. This method achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for convex objectives and
under strong convexity, $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to an
$\varepsilon$-solution and $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to a
neighborhood. Replacing the proximal map of the sum $\sum_j G_j$ with the
proximal map of a single randomly selected regularizer $G_j$ preserves
convergence while eliminating global coordination. Experiments validate both
convergence rates and communication efficiency across synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: BEACON是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和1D CNN的深度学习框架，用于行为恶意软件分类，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态分析难以应对现代恶意软件的复杂性和规避技术，行为检测提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 利用LLM从沙箱生成的行为报告中提取密集上下文嵌入，再通过1D CNN进行分类。

Result: 在Avast-CTU Public CAPE数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM生成的行为嵌入和BEACON框架设计对恶意软件分类有效。

Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential
to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static
analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code
obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast,
behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a
more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior
reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each
sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D
CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public
CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,
highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the
overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.

*Muhammad Awais Ali,Marlon Dumas,Fredrik Milani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种预测业务流程中活动开始和结束时间的技术，以支持资源容量规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅预测活动的单一时间戳，不足以支持资源规划。

Method: 采用扫掠线方法，同步预测所有进行中案例的后缀，考虑资源占用情况。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上验证了多模型方法的准确性优势。

Conclusion: 多模型方法能更准确地预测活动时间，适用于资源规划。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量快速的Muon优化器（LiMuon），用于高效训练大型模型，降低了内存需求和样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Muon优化器及其变体在训练大型模型时存在高样本复杂度或高内存问题，需要改进。

Method: 基于动量方差缩减技术和随机奇异值分解（SVD），设计了LiMuon优化器。

Result: LiMuon在非凸随机优化中具有较低的样本复杂度（O(ε⁻³)），并在广义平滑条件下验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LiMuon在训练大型模型时表现出高效性，适用于不满足严格平滑条件的任务。

Abstract: Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so
efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More
recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for
matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to
studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from
high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we
propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models,
which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory
than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has
a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the
smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer
mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial
intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy
this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition.
Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify
efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境知识的发现依赖于标记的任务特定数据，但数据收集成本高，现有机器学习方法在数据稀疏或非典型条件下泛化能力差。

Method: 设计了多层级对学习损失训练场景编码器，捕捉场景间不同程度的相似性，驱动检索机制补充目标场景数据；并设计了增强自适应机制选择性增强非典型场景。

Result: 在淡水生态系统中，A²SL显著提升了水温和溶解氧动态的预测准确性，增强了数据稀缺和非典型场景下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: A²SL框架不仅适用于淡水生态系统，还为其他科学领域提供了广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: The discovery of environmental knowledge depends on labeled task-specific
data, but is often constrained by the high cost of data collection. Existing
machine learning approaches usually struggle to generalize in data-sparse or
atypical conditions. To this end, we propose an Augmentation-Adaptive
Self-Supervised Learning (A$^2$SL) framework, which retrieves relevant
observational samples to enhance modeling of the target ecosystem.
Specifically, we introduce a multi-level pairwise learning loss to train a
scenario encoder that captures varying degrees of similarity among scenarios.
These learned similarities drive a retrieval mechanism that supplements a
target scenario with relevant data from different locations or time periods.
Furthermore, to better handle variable scenarios, particularly under atypical
or extreme conditions where traditional models struggle, we design an
augmentation-adaptive mechanism that selectively enhances these scenarios
through targeted data augmentation. Using freshwater ecosystems as a case
study, we evaluate A$^2$SL in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen
dynamics in real-world lakes. Experimental results show that A$^2$SL
significantly improves predictive accuracy and enhances robustness in
data-scarce and atypical scenarios. Although this study focuses on freshwater
ecosystems, the A$^2$SL framework offers a broadly applicable solution in
various scientific domains.

Result: 在1D泊松方程和2D Fisher-KPP方程案例中，E-PINN的覆盖概率校准显著优于贝叶斯PINN和深度集成方法。

Conclusion: E-PINN在理论和实际应用中表现出色，尤其适用于医学研究中的葡萄糖-胰岛素数据分析。

Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying
Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of
uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of
evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers
unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating
our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a
Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated
empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than
Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world
applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze
clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on
diabetes pathophysiology.

TL;DR: SPMD-LRT是一种针对高阶张量数据的结构保持边缘分布学习方法，通过低秩分解直接处理张量数据，提高了分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMDM方法在处理高维张量数据时需要向量化，破坏了数据的多维结构并增加了计算负担。

Method: SPMD-LRT结合一阶和二阶张量统计量（边缘均值和方差），利用低秩分解（如CP和Tucker分解）参数化权重张量，并通过交替优化算法高效求解。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SPMD-LRT的分类精度优于传统SVM、基于向量的LMDM和先前的张量SVM扩展方法。

Conclusion: SPMD-LRT在保持高维张量数据结构的同时优化边缘分布，是一种有效且鲁棒的分类方法。

Abstract: The Large Margin Distribution Machine (LMDM) is a recent advancement in
classifier design that optimizes not just the minimum margin (as in SVM) but
the entire margin distribution, thereby improving generalization. However,
existing LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with
high-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the
data's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In
this paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for
High-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates
directly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT
preserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and
second-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,
and it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),
higher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An
alternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to
efficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core
tensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information
of high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved
classification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,
images and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior
classification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and
prior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker
Machines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest
accuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling
high-dimensional tensor data for classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展离线训练的GMM-QFs，开发在线方案以利用流数据促进探索，同时通过稀疏化调节模型复杂度。

Method: 采用Hadamard过参数化进行稀疏化，避免过拟合；利用黎曼流形结构进行参数更新。

Result: S-GMM-QFs在标准基准测试中性能与密集深度强化学习方法相当，但参数更少，且在低参数情况下仍表现良好。

Conclusion: S-GMM-QFs是一种高效且可扩展的强化学习方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a structured and interpretable online policy-iteration
framework for reinforcement learning (RL), built around the novel class of
sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions (S-GMM-QFs). Extending earlier work
that trained GMM-QFs offline, the proposed framework develops an online scheme
that leverages streaming data to encourage exploration. Model complexity is
regulated through sparsification by Hadamard overparametrization, which
mitigates overfitting while preserving expressiveness. The parameter space of
S-GMM-QFs is naturally endowed with a Riemannian manifold structure, allowing
for principled parameter updates via online gradient descent on a smooth
objective. Numerical tests show that S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense
deep RL (DeepRL) methods on standard benchmarks while using significantly fewer
parameters, and maintain strong performance even in low-parameter-count regimes
where sparsified DeepRL methods fail to generalize.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合能量匹配项的损失函数，用于改进粗粒度机器学习模型在分子动力学模拟中的性能，但未显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统力匹配方法难以捕捉完整的热力学景观，因此需要新的方法来改进粗粒度模型的性能。

Method: 在损失函数中引入能量匹配项，并使用CGSchNet模型在Chignolin蛋白上进行评估。

Result: 能量匹配未显著提升准确性，但揭示了模型在自由能表面泛化上的不同趋势。

Conclusion: 未来可通过改进能量估计技术和多模态损失公式来增强粗粒度建模。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into
biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required
to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a
promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching
approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a
model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy
conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy
matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the
Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight
of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically
significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how
models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future
opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy
estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Split Federated Learning存在隐私风险（如数据重建攻击）和模型性能下降问题，需要一种既能保护隐私又能保持模型效用的方法。

Method: 提出PM-SFL框架，结合概率掩码训练（添加结构化随机性）和个性化掩码学习（适应客户端数据），并引入层间知识补偿机制处理系统异构性。

Result: 理论分析验证了隐私保护能力，实验表明PM-SFL在准确性、通信效率和隐私攻击鲁棒性上表现优异，尤其在数据和系统异构性下。

Conclusion: PM-SFL是一种高效、隐私保护的Split Federated Learning解决方案，适用于异构环境。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) has emerged as an efficient alternative to
traditional Federated Learning (FL) by reducing client-side computation through
model partitioning. However, exchanging of intermediate activations and model
updates introduces significant privacy risks, especially from data
reconstruction attacks that recover original inputs from intermediate
representations. Existing defenses using noise injection often degrade model
performance. To overcome these challenges, we present PM-SFL, a scalable and
privacy-preserving SFL framework that incorporates Probabilistic Mask training
to add structured randomness without relying on explicit noise. This mitigates
data reconstruction risks while maintaining model utility. To address data
heterogeneity, PM-SFL employs personalized mask learning that tailors submodel
structures to each client's local data. For system heterogeneity, we introduce
a layer-wise knowledge compensation mechanism, enabling clients with varying
resources to participate effectively under adaptive model splitting.
Theoretical analysis confirms its privacy protection, and experiments on image
and wireless sensing tasks demonstrate that PM-SFL consistently improves
accuracy, communication efficiency, and robustness to privacy attacks, with
particularly strong performance under data and system heterogeneity.

Abstract: Energy-efficient medical data classification is essential for modern disease
screening, particularly in home and field healthcare where embedded devices are
prevalent. While deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their
substantial energy consumption and reliance on GPUs limit deployment on such
platforms. We present Hyperdimensional Computing with Class-Wise Clustering
(HD3C), a lightweight classification framework designed for low-power
environments. HD3C encodes data into high-dimensional hypervectors, aggregates
them into multiple cluster-specific prototypes, and performs classification
through similarity search in hyperspace. We evaluate HD3C across three medical
classification tasks; on heart sound classification, HD3C is $350\times$ more
energy-efficient than Bayesian ResNet with less than 1% accuracy difference.
Moreover, HD3C demonstrates exceptional robustness to noise, limited training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法过于注重效率和激进遗忘，导致模型不稳定和可靠性下降。

Method: CUFG结合了基于遗忘梯度的梯度校正器和从易到难的课程遗忘策略。

Result: CUFG缩小了与黄金标准Retrain方法的差距，提升了遗忘的稳定性和渐进性。

Conclusion: 课程遗忘概念具有研究潜力，CUFG为机器遗忘领域提供了前瞻性见解。

Abstract: As privacy and security take center stage in AI, machine unlearning, the
ability to erase specific knowledge from models, has garnered increasing
attention. However, existing methods overly prioritize efficiency and
aggressive forgetting, which introduces notable limitations. In particular,
radical interventions like gradient ascent, influence functions, and random
label noise can destabilize model weights, leading to collapse and reduced
reliability. To address this, we propose CUFG (Curriculum Unlearning via
Forgetting Gradients), a novel framework that enhances the stability of
approximate unlearning through innovations in both forgetting mechanisms and
data scheduling strategies. Specifically, CUFG integrates a new gradient
corrector guided by forgetting gradients for fine-tuning-based unlearning and a
curriculum unlearning paradigm that progressively forgets from easy to hard.
These innovations narrow the gap with the gold-standard Retrain method by
enabling more stable and progressive unlearning, thereby improving both
effectiveness and reliability. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of
curriculum unlearning has substantial research potential and offers
forward-looking insights for the development of the MU field. Extensive
experiments across various forgetting scenarios validate the rationale and
effectiveness of our approach and CUFG. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法仅依赖序列索引，忽略了信号特性，难以处理时间序列中的复杂动态。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）从输入时间序列直接生成位置嵌入。

Result: 在10个数据集上表现优于8种现有方法，平均相对提升9.1%。

Conclusion: DyWPE是一种高效且信号感知的位置编码方法，适用于时间序列分析。

Abstract: Existing positional encoding methods in transformers are fundamentally
signal-agnostic, deriving positional information solely from sequence indices
while ignoring the underlying signal characteristics. This limitation is
particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit
complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce
Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework
that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列中的动态时间依赖性因分布偏移和多尺度模式而变化，现有方法难以捕捉短期和长期依赖的复杂交互，导致泛化能力下降。

Method: DeCoP结合实例级补丁归一化（IPN）和分层依赖控制学习（DCL），通过实例级对比模块（ICM）增强全局泛化能力。

Result: 在十个数据集上达到SOTA，ETTh1上MSE提升3%，仅使用37%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: DeCoP通过显式建模多尺度依赖关系，显著提升了时间序列预训练模型的泛化性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series
pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns.
This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex
interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to
spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these
limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework
that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving
inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise
Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving
the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for
representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency
Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies
across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module
(ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative
representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves
state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时钟机制的注意力模型，用于连续有序序列的对齐任务，提高了稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准点积注意力缺乏连续性和单调性约束，而这对帧同步任务至关重要。

Method: 通过学习的非负时钟建模注意力，利用路径积分推导出高斯式评分规则，支持并行和自回归解码。

Result: 在文本到语音任务中，模型表现出更稳定的对齐效果和更好的时间缩放鲁棒性，同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他连续目标任务，如视频和时间信号建模。

Abstract: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that
explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many
sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on
positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity,
which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative
\emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting
probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form,
Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth,
near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The
framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel
decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for
autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In
a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable
alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or
improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize
applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal
modeling.

TL;DR: DSCL框架通过动态采样和课程学习提升LLM工具学习的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态采样技术不适用于工具学习的多任务结构和细粒度奖励机制。

Method: DSCL包含基于奖励的动态采样和基于任务的动态课程学习。

Result: 在BFCLv3基准上性能提升3.29%。

Conclusion: DSCL有效利用复杂奖励信号和子任务动态，实现更优结果。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PreGC的图压缩方法，通过最优传输和预训练技术，解决了传统图压缩方法对任务和架构依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图压缩方法依赖于特定任务和架构，限制了其复用性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于最优传输的预训练图压缩方法（PreGC），通过混合间隔图扩散增强和语义一致性匹配来提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明PreGC具有任务无关性，并能与任意GNN架构兼容。

Conclusion: PreGC通过优化表示传输计划和语义协调器，实现了高效且通用的图压缩。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) aims to distill the original graph into a small-scale
graph, mitigating redundancy and accelerating GNN training. However,
conventional GC approaches heavily rely on rigid GNNs and task-specific
supervision. Such a dependency severely restricts their reusability and
generalization across various tasks and architectures. In this work, we revisit
the goal of ideal GC from the perspective of GNN optimization consistency, and
then a generalized GC optimization objective is derived, by which those
traditional GC methods can be viewed nicely as special cases of this
optimization paradigm. Based on this, Pre-trained Graph Condensation (PreGC)
via optimal transport is proposed to transcend the limitations of task- and
architecture-dependent GC methods. Specifically, a hybrid-interval graph
diffusion augmentation is presented to suppress the weak generalization ability
of the condensed graph on particular architectures by enhancing the uncertainty
of node states. Meanwhile, the matching between optimal graph transport plan
and representation transport plan is tactfully established to maintain semantic
consistencies across source graph and condensed graph spaces, thereby freeing
graph condensation from task dependencies. To further facilitate the adaptation
of condensed graphs to various downstream tasks, a traceable semantic
harmonizer from source nodes to condensed nodes is proposed to bridge semantic
associations through the optimized representation transport plan in
pre-training. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and versatility of
PreGC, demonstrating its task-independent nature and seamless compatibility
with arbitrary GNNs.

Result: 提取的电路对应真实生物机制，证实transcoder的潜力。

Conclusion: transcoder能有效揭示单细胞模型中的生物通路，增强模型可解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance on various tasks, such as cell-type annotation and perturbation
response prediction, by learning gene regulatory networks from large-scale
transcriptome data. However, a significant challenge remains: the
decision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to
traditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently,
transcoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable
decision circuits from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we train a
transcoder on the cell2sentence (C2S) model, a state-of-the-art scFM. By
leveraging the trained transcoder, we extract internal decision-making circuits
from the C2S model. We demonstrate that the discovered circuits correspond to
real-world biological mechanisms, confirming the potential of transcoders to
uncover biologically plausible pathways within complex single-cell models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锚图多视图聚类方法存在信息冗余和噪声干扰问题，且聚类效果和效率因独立后处理而下降。

Method: OMCAL采用核范数自适应学习高质量共识锚图，并将类别指示器获取与锚图学习统一到一个框架中。

Result: 在普通和大规模数据集上的实验表明，OMCAL在聚类效果和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OMCAL通过统一框架和自适应学习显著提升了多视图聚类的效果和效率。

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在6小时间隔预测中表现良好，但每小时预测仍面临误差累积和数据同化周期不连续的问题。

Method: 采用连续流建模，结合动态流匹配和ODE求解器，并引入低秩AdaLN-Zero调制机制以减少模型大小。

Result: FlowCast-ODE在RMSE和能量守恒方面优于基线，减少了模糊并保留了更多空间细节，且在极端事件预测中表现优异。

Conclusion: FlowCast-ODE通过连续流建模有效解决了每小时天气预报的挑战，同时减少了模型复杂度和数据同化不连续性。

Abstract: Accurate hourly weather forecasting is critical for numerous applications.
Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capability on 6-hour
intervals, yet achieving accurate and stable hourly predictions remains a
critical challenge. This is primarily due to the rapid accumulation of errors
in autoregressive rollouts and temporal discontinuities within the ERA5 data's
12-hour assimilation cycle. To address these issues, we propose FlowCast-ODE, a
framework that models atmospheric state evolution as a continuous flow.
FlowCast-ODE learns the conditional flow path directly from the previous state,
an approach that aligns more naturally with physical dynamic systems and
enables efficient computation. A coarse-to-fine strategy is introduced to train
the model on 6-hour data using dynamic flow matching and then refined on hourly
data that incorporates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to
achieve temporally coherent forecasts. In addition, a lightweight low-rank
AdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15%
without compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE
outperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and
better energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more
fine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons.
Furthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with
assimilation cycle transitions.

Motivation: 研究在预训练数据有限但算力充足的情况下，如何通过算法改进提高数据效率。

Method: 通过调整正则化参数、增加参数数量和集成独立训练模型来优化预训练。

Result: 最佳干预组合在200M tokens上实现了5.17倍的数据效率提升，且通过蒸馏保留了83%的集成收益。

Conclusion: 简单算法改进可在算力充足时显著提高预训练的数据效率。

Abstract: Since compute grows much faster than web text available for language model
pre-training, we ask how one should approach pre-training under fixed data and
no compute constraints. We first show that existing data-constrained approaches
of increasing epoch count and parameter count eventually overfit, and we
significantly improve upon such recipes by properly tuning regularization,
finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\times$ larger than standard
practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a
simple power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance
via the asymptote of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed
compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models
achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our
best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and
ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\times$ less
data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement
persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be
realized at much smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a
student model that is 8$\times$ smaller and retains $83\%$ of the ensembling
benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to
downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9\%$ improvement for pre-training evals and
a $17.5\times$ data efficiency improvement over continued pre-training on math
mid-training data. Our results show that simple algorithmic improvements can
enable significantly more data-efficient pre-training in a compute-rich future.

Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central
challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer
scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction
framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while
maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and
BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening
tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in
AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned
aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing
predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial
correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention
patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's
utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

Abstract: While trajectory prediction plays a critical role in enabling safe and
effective path-planning in automated vehicles, standardized practices for
evaluating such models remain underdeveloped. Recent efforts have aimed to
unify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing
frameworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,
joint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP
-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a
unified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and
evaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We
demonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1)
the limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint
modeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the
vulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution
shifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents. With STEP, we aim to shift
the focus from the ``leaderboard'' approach to deeper insights about model
behavior and generalization in complex multi-agent settings.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了联合估计优于两步法。

Conclusion: PNNs通过任务感知的精度矩阵学习，提升了表达能力和稳定性。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform convolutions on the graph
determined by the covariance matrix of the data, which enables expressive and
stable covariance-based learning. However, covariance matrices are typically
dense, fail to encode conditional independence, and are often precomputed in a
task-agnostic way, which may hinder performance. To overcome these limitations,
we study Precision Neural Networks (PNNs), i.e., VNNs on the precision matrix
-- the inverse covariance. The precision matrix naturally encodes statistical
independence, often exhibits sparsity, and preserves the covariance spectral
structure. To make precision estimation task-aware, we formulate an
optimization problem that jointly learns the network parameters and the
precision matrix, and solve it via alternating optimization, by sequentially
updating the network weights and the precision estimate. We theoretically bound
the distance between the estimated and true precision matrices at each
iteration, and demonstrate the effectiveness of joint estimation compared to
two-step approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: 在纽约州日前电力市场的能源套利优化任务中，DST表现优于传统模型和强化学习基线，且能更高效地处理不确定性。

Conclusion: DST框架在随机优化中表现优异，能够通过更好地处理不确定性来提升决策效率。

Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain
systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full
distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario
Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for
multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting
models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a
tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on
observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization
task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same
optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models
and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for
stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving
higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and
stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.

Result: 理论分析证明其无遗憾性，实验显示优于现有基准。

Conclusion: MF-HRL-IGM在多保真度环境下高效优化策略，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的图Transformer架构可能因全局注意力机制导致局部邻域信息丢失，因此需要一种新的注意力机制来平衡全局和局部信息的捕获。

Method: G2LFormer采用全局到局部注意力机制，浅层用注意力捕获全局信息，深层用GNN学习局部信息，并引入跨层信息融合策略。

Result: G2LFormer在节点级和图级任务中表现优异，同时保持线性复杂度。

Conclusion: G2LFormer通过全局到局部注意力机制有效解决了信息丢失问题，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation
learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to
attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention
scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures
long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer
from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN
could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer,
featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network
layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper
layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby
preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective
cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to
retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information
loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of
the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with
state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The
results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping
linear complexity.

Conclusion: 双域信息和交叉注意力机制是DPANet的核心组件。

Abstract: We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components
(Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all
variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized
versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a
Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants
underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous
temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the
cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the
most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our
interactive fusion block is the most essential component.

Conclusion: 部分观测的低通滤波图信号下，朴素图学习方法具有隐式鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due
to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay
channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process
for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed
analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic
overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the
simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process
typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic
method exists.
  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,
we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the
critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty
hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is
broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from
a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits
the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with
highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs
to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful
trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also
incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token
sequences representing decays.

Abstract: This short paper presents a general approach for computing robust Wasserstein
barycenters of persistence diagrams. The classical method consists in computing
assignment arithmetic means after finding the optimal transport plans between
the barycenter and the persistence diagrams. However, this procedure only works
for the transportation cost related to the $q$-Wasserstein distance $W_q$ when
$q=2$. We adapt an alternative fixed-point method to compute a barycenter
diagram for generic transportation costs ($q > 1$), in particular those robust
to outliers, $q \in (1,2)$. We show the utility of our work in two
applications: \emph{(i)} the clustering of persistence diagrams on their metric
space and \emph{(ii)} the dictionary encoding of persistence diagrams. In both
scenarios, we demonstrate the added robustness to outliers provided by our
generalized framework. Our Python implementation is available at this address:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that incorporate deep neural networks
(DNN), though powerful, often lack transparency. Their black-box characteristic
hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical
domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on
Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction
methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our
approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and
global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method
on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs
can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work
highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in
AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong
performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing
robust explanations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAG的双因果网络框架，用于结合外生变量（尤其是未来外生变量）提升时间序列预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用未来外生变量，且忽略了内生与外生变量间的因果关系，导致预测性能不佳。

Method: DAG框架包含时间因果模块和通道因果模块，分别建模外生变量间的时序因果关系及其对内生变量的影响。

Result: 通过双因果网络，DAG框架显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Conclusion: DAG框架为结合外生变量的时间序列预测提供了一种有效方法，尤其在利用未来外生变量方面表现突出。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics,
traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the
endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure
accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)
provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting
accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous
variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage
future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal
relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their
performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous
variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework
DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel
dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,
we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal
discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future
exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module
that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of
forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous
variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar
design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical
exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal
injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the
prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

Conclusion: 研究有助于防止数字环境操纵，保护在线讨论完整性。

Abstract: Social media has become a key medium of communication in today's society.
This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots)
to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to
such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language
models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the
effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder
transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater
accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater
adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for
generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa.
These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments
being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习框架通常忽略客户端移动性，且假设本地数据绝对私有。本文旨在同时考虑数据共享和移动性模式，优化资源受限下的联邦学习过程。

Method: 引入有效数据覆盖率和冗余数据覆盖率概念，通过初步实验分析数据对模型性能的影响，提出动态优化算法DO-SNM。

Result: 实验表明，DO-SNM算法在降低能耗的同时，模型性能优于传统基线算法。

Conclusion: HFL-SNM框架通过结合社交网络和移动性，有效优化了联邦学习的能耗和性能，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows
collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting
data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically
preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private,
whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on
the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data
sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of
limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource
allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy
consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce
the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate.
We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model
performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization
problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary
experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with
Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing
energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Malnutrition among pregnant women is a major public health challenge in
Ethiopia, increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Traditional statistical approaches often fail to capture the complex and
multidimensional determinants of nutritional status. This study develops a
predictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data
from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108
records with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing
included handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE,
followed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised
ensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost
were applied to classify nutritional status. Among them, the Random Forest
model achieved the best performance, classifying women into four categories
(normal, moderate malnutrition, severe malnutrition, and overnutrition) with
97.87% accuracy, 97.88% precision, 97.87% recall, 97.87% F1-score, and 99.86%
ROC AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning in
capturing hidden patterns from complex datasets and provide timely insights for
early detection of nutritional risks. The results offer practical implications
for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers, supporting data-driven
strategies to improve maternal nutrition and health outcomes in Ethiopia.

Motivation: 解决在重尾噪声环境下，随机双层优化和非凸-强凹极小极大优化的高效算法设计问题。

Method: 提出N²SBA方法，利用归一化技术处理重尾噪声，并通过嵌套循环结构优化计算效率。

Conclusion: N²SBA方法在重尾噪声环境下表现优异，为相关优化问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper considers the smooth bilevel optimization in which the lower-level
problem is strongly convex and the upper-level problem is possibly nonconvex.
We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased
stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in
many machine learning applications such as training large language models and
reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel
approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the
stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number,
$p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the
noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the
nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an
$\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}}
\epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known
results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.

Motivation: 随着无线技术发展，网络需更好理解物理世界，但专用硬件部署成本高且复杂。ISAC被动感知提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用原始transformer架构，融合Wi-Fi和5G信息，设计FAWN网络进行环境感知。

Result: 原型测试显示，84%的情况下误差低于0.6米。

Conclusion: FAWN通过多技术融合，显著提升了ISAC被动感知的精度和覆盖范围。

Abstract: The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where
everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence
grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,
deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always
feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.
Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses
wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with
existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are
limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum
accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we
see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage
area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a
MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.
FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information
from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical
world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,
we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show
errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.

with our step-size under various assumptions, and we show that it empirically
competes against tuned baselines.

Result: AGCN在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGCN证明了注意力机制在图聚类中的有效性，并提出高效实现方法。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks,
driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to
graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential,
remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize
neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations.
Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at
the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question:
Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address
this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the
complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated
by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a
novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN
directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling
effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local
topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast
AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV
cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin
contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill
acquisition in robotics. Our project website can be found at

Conclusion: DEER通过区分环境变化和策略更新的影响，显著提升了非平稳环境中的强化学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as
changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated.
Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error
prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's
policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under
dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of
Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment
shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of
Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that
prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.
DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies
distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more
sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks
demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms
by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模时空依赖性和对比学习，显著提升了多元时间序列异常检测的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by
modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations}
found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an
anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time
series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time
series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing
approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally)
independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach
addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and
decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics,
and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture
temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a
multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components
are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive
learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate
normal and anomaly samples.

Conclusion: 该方法通过揭示驱动预测的模式结构，实现了透明决策，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in
11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming
baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell
signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent
decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive
predictive outcomes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from
sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper
presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning
with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a
multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and
Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention
mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited
significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies
despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid
methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from
rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid
approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,
substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed
high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture
enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining
training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based
initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust
solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments
where pure exploration proves insufficient.

sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving
overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel
metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns
within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model
performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined
with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while
improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach
provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and
model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set,
including input and output dimensions.

*Federico Alvetreti,Jary Pomponi,Paolo Di Lorenzo,Simone Scardapane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADC的新型通信高效分割学习框架，通过双重压缩策略减少Vision Transformers激活的传输开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少分割学习训练过程中传输中间Vision Transformers激活的通信开销。

Method: 采用两种并行压缩策略：基于注意力分数合并相似样本的激活（类无关），并丢弃最不重要的标记。

Result: 显著减少通信开销，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ADC在减少通信开销方面优于现有分割学习框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 解决ℓ0正则化回归中蒙特卡洛采样效率低的问题，并探索非线性压缩感知中参数恢复的可行性。

Method: 通过概率重构方法避免蒙特卡洛采样，计算精确梯度；在非线性压缩感知中，基于Fefferman和Markel的理论，研究参数恢复的对称性问题。

Result: 新方法在收敛速度和性能上优于现有算法；非线性压缩感知中参数恢复受对称性限制，且存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 线性与非线性压缩感知存在根本差异，新方法为ℓ0正则化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized
regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the
computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima
of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves
convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing
algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and
signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and
GPUs and is freely available at
https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive
sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network
is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of
Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the
infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical
validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical
representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help
to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even
possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound
effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but
subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings
indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive
sensing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间序列聚类的新框架，通过深度学习模型提升互联网流量矩阵预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流量矩阵中的流量通常表现出多样化的时间行为，单一模型难以准确预测所有流量。

Method: 采用源聚类和直方图聚类两种策略，将具有相似时间模式的流量分组后再训练模型。

Result: 在Abilene和GÉANT数据集上，RMSE分别降低了92%和75%；路由场景中最大链路利用率偏差分别减少了18%和21%。

Conclusion: 聚类方法能显著提升流量矩阵预测的准确性和网络优化效果。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve
internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models.
Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can
hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To
address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and
histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to
model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling
models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better
than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM.
Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to
92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered
predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%,
respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are
used for network optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在反馈受限的非平稳多臂老虎机中的无先验算法，实现了接近最优的动态遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设每轮都有奖励反馈，但现实中反馈往往是受限的，因此需要研究反馈受限的非平稳多臂老虎机问题。

Method: 提出了一种无先验算法，不需要非平稳性的先验知识，适用于反馈受限的场景。

Result: 算法实现了动态遗憾$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$，其中$T$为轮数，$K$为臂数，$B$为查询预算，$V_T$为非平稳性度量。

Conclusion: 该算法在反馈受限的非平稳多臂老虎机问题中表现优异，为动态环境中的决策提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits enable agents to adapt to changing
environments by incorporating mechanisms to detect and respond to shifts in
reward distributions, making them well-suited for dynamic settings. However,
existing approaches typically assume that reward feedback is available at every
round - an assumption that overlooks many real-world scenarios where feedback
is limited. In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a
new model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where
the availability of reward feedback is restricted. We propose the first
prior-free algorithm - that is, one that does not require prior knowledge of
the degree of non-stationarity - that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in
this setting. Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the
number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$
is the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.

Conclusion: 系统设计注重用户体验，未来将优化为绿色CNN架构以实现实时边缘计算。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable
and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN
architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time
inference on edge platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在联邦学习中因异构数据和计算限制导致的性能问题。

Method: 提出FedLEASE框架，结合自适应聚类和Mixture-of-Experts机制，优化LoRA专家的分配与选择。

Result: 在异构数据集上显著优于现有方法，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: FedLEASE为联邦学习中的LLMs提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various tasks, but fine-tuning them for domain-specific applications often
requires substantial domain-specific data that may be distributed across
multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to
LLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with
heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical
challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and
allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling
clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data
characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation
and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on
representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts.
It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows
each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE
significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in
heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过多样性和战略交互，即使个体未完美对齐，也能实现近似完美对齐的实用效果。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values remains a fundamental challenge, but
does our inability to create perfectly aligned models preclude obtaining the
benefits of alignment? We study a strategic setting where a human user
interacts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are
individually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies
approximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that
becomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition
can yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We
model this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to
multi-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three
results: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her
Bayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex
hull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility
learning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal
utility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI
after an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without
further distributional assumptions. We complement the theory with two sets of
experiments.

Result: 显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能，适用于能源受限的边缘部署和实时适应。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了可扩展性，减少了冗余计算，符合可持续AI的原则。

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep learning, particularly in
large-scale architectures such as foundation models and large language models
(LLMs), pose significant challenges to sustainability. Traditional
gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative
updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based
direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural
network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step
equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction,
while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual
updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both
hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning
with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive
decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances
scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of
sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate
that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high
model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time
adaptation in energy-constrained environments.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is critical in domains like energy, finance,
healthcare, and logistics, requiring models that generalize across diverse

frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple
frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects
relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting. Despite its
simplicity, Super-Linear matches state-of-the-art performance while offering
superior efficiency, robustness to various sampling rates, and enhanced

Conclusion: 当前基准存在临床弱点，需开发临床验证的数据集和更公平的评估框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown significant promise in chest radiography,
where deep learning models can approach radiologist-level diagnostic
performance. Progress has been accelerated by large public datasets such as
MIMIC-CXR, ChestX-ray14, PadChest, and CheXpert, which provide hundreds of
thousands of labelled images with pathology annotations. However, these
datasets also present important limitations. Automated label extraction from
radiology reports introduces errors, particularly in handling uncertainty and
negation, and radiologist review frequently disagrees with assigned labels. In
addition, domain shift and population bias restrict model generalisability,
while evaluation practices often overlook clinically meaningful measures. We
conduct a systematic analysis of these challenges, focusing on label quality,
dataset bias, and domain shift. Our cross-dataset domain shift evaluation
across multiple model architectures revealed substantial external performance
degradation, with pronounced reductions in AUPRC and F1 scores relative to
internal testing. To assess dataset bias, we trained a source-classification
model that distinguished datasets with near-perfect accuracy, and performed
subgroup analyses showing reduced performance for minority age and sex groups.
Finally, expert review by two board-certified radiologists identified
significant disagreement with public dataset labels. Our findings highlight
important clinical weaknesses of current benchmarks and emphasise the need for
clinician-validated datasets and fairer evaluation frameworks.

Result: 实验显示TDRM在Best-of-N和树搜索场景中提升性能，结合RLVR后数据效率显著提高。

Conclusion: TDRM是一种补充性方法，可提升奖励模型的可靠性和强化学习效果。

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable
performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to
attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants
(5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414,
Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B). We release

Abstract: The growing demand for energy-efficient, high-performance AI systems has led
to increased attention on alternative computing platforms (e.g., photonic,
neuromorphic) due to their potential to accelerate learning and inference.
However, integrating such physical components into deep learning pipelines
remains challenging, as physical devices often offer limited expressiveness,
and their non-differentiable nature renders on-device backpropagation difficult
or infeasible. This motivates the development of hybrid architectures that
combine digital neural networks with reconfigurable physical layers, which
effectively behave as black boxes. In this work, we present a framework for the
end-to-end training of such hybrid networks. This framework integrates
stochastic zeroth-order optimization for updating the physical layer's internal
parameters with a dynamic low-rank surrogate model that enables gradient
propagation through the physical layer. A key component of our approach is the
implicit projector-splitting integrator algorithm, which updates the
lightweight surrogate model after each forward pass with minimal hardware
queries, thereby avoiding costly full matrix reconstruction. We demonstrate our
method across diverse deep learning tasks, including: computer vision, audio
classification, and language modeling. Notably, across all modalities, the
proposed approach achieves near-digital baseline accuracy and consistently
enables effective end-to-end training of hybrid models incorporating various
non-differentiable physical components (spatial light modulators, microring
resonators, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers). This work bridges hardware-aware
deep learning and gradient-free optimization, thereby offering a practical
pathway for integrating non-differentiable physical components into scalable,
end-to-end trainable AI systems.

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios, such as medical imaging applications, it is
critical to equip the predictions of a regression model with reliable
confidence intervals. Recently, Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a
powerful statistical framework that, based on a labeled calibration set,
generates intervals that include the true labels with a pre-specified
probability. In this paper, we address the problem of applying CP for
regression models when the calibration set contains noisy labels. We begin by
establishing a mathematically grounded procedure for estimating the noise-free
CP threshold. Then, we turn it into a practical algorithm that overcomes the
challenges arising from the continuous nature of the regression problem. We
evaluate the proposed method on two medical imaging regression datasets with
Gaussian label noise. Our method significantly outperforms the existing
alternative, achieving performance close to the clean-label setting.

Abstract: Motivated by problems in online advertising, we address the task of Learning
from Label Proportions (LLP). In this partially-supervised setting, training
data consists of groups of examples, termed bags, for which we only observe the
average label value. The main goal, however, remains the design of a predictor
for the labels of individual examples. We introduce a novel and versatile
low-variance de-biasing methodology to learn from aggregate label information,
significantly advancing the state of the art in LLP. Our approach exhibits
remarkable flexibility, seamlessly accommodating a broad spectrum of
practically relevant loss functions across both binary and multi-class
classification settings. By carefully combining our estimators with standard
techniques, we substantially improve sample complexity guarantees for a large
class of losses of practical relevance. We also empirically validate the
efficacy of our proposed approach across a diverse array of benchmark datasets,
demonstrating compelling empirical advantages over standard baselines.

Evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, these methods reduce communication overhead,

behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at
https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Off-Policy-SFT.

Abstract: The evolution of quantization and mixed-precision techniques has unlocked new
possibilities for enhancing the speed and energy efficiency of NNs. Several
recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different
parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while
significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded
microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing
mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,
resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and
underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions
and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize
mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on
RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software
co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a
combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level
optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance
the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for
weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while
implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we
integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and
a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal
mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost
the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely
used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our
framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss
and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up
to 1.8 TOPs/W.

TL;DR: EVOL-RL是一种无需标签的强化学习方法，通过结合稳定性和多样性，防止模型生成结果的熵崩溃，提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无标签方法（如置信度最小化、自一致性或多数投票目标）会导致探索性下降和熵崩溃，限制了模型的多样性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出EVOL-RL，结合多数投票答案作为稳定锚点，并引入新颖性奖励以鼓励语义空间中的多样性。

Result: EVOL-RL显著提升模型性能（如AIME25 pass@1从4.6%提升至16.4%），并防止多样性崩溃，增强跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: EVOL-RL是一种通用且有效的无标签强化学习方法，适用于多种场景，包括RLVR设置。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis,
enabling automatic annotation, disease screening, and prognosis beyond
traditional clinical capabilities. However, understanding these models remains
a challenge, limiting interpretation and gaining knowledge from these
developments. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability method for
convolutional neural networks applied to ECG analysis. Our approach extracts
time-localized clusters from the model's internal representations, segmenting
the ECG according to the learned characteristics while quantifying the
uncertainty of these representations. This allows us to visualize how different
waveform regions contribute to the model's predictions and assess the certainty
of its decisions. By providing a structured and interpretable view of deep
learning models for ECG, our method enhances trust in AI-driven diagnostics and
facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant electrophysiological patterns.

TL;DR: CausalPre是一种可扩展的因果公平数据预处理框架，无需强因果模型假设即可实现公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖强因果模型假设或忽略关键属性关系，导致公平性与效用难以兼顾。

Result: 实验证明CausalPre在公平性和可扩展性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CausalPre挑战了因果公平需牺牲关系覆盖或模型假设的传统观念。

Abstract: Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate
outcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal
model, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional
constraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute
relationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a
fundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design
efficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong
assumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer
this question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective
causality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable
fairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair
relationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally
infeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To
ensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of
low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,
complemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated
computational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the
conventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off
relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.

TL;DR: FlowRL通过平衡奖励分布而非最大化奖励，提升LLM强化学习的多样性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励最大化方法（如PPO和GRPO）容易过度优化主导奖励信号，忽视低频但有效的推理路径，导致多样性降低。

Method: 将标量奖励转化为归一化目标分布，通过最小化反向KL散度实现流平衡优化，促进多样探索和泛化推理轨迹。

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务中，FlowRL平均比GRPO提升10.0%，比PPO提升5.1%，表现一致更优。

Conclusion: 奖励分布匹配是LLM强化学习中实现高效探索和多样推理的关键步骤。

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.
