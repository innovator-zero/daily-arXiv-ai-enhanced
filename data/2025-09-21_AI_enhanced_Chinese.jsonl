However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack\nof large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels.

By systematically\ninjecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful\ntrajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures.

We demonstrate the value of our dataset by\nexploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:\nSupervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve\nsubstantial improvements across all three learning paradigms.

In motion planning,\nautonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by\ngeometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,\nrule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic\npriors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features\nlearned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance\npriors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose\nFlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable\nenergy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to\nencode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware\nfeatures enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as\ninterpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples\nmotion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion\nplanner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing\nmultimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that\nFlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,\nsurpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

Through\nrigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning\nnegative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration\nmethods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a\nmethodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:\nnegative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while\ndestroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to\nescape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE\nless than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution.

Current SD-map-based\napproaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and\nmaps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily\navailable, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose\nDiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS\ndenoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS\ntrajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly\nencode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative\ndiffusion refinement.

However,\nexisting LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with\nhigh-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the\ndata's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for\nHigh-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates\ndirectly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT\npreserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and\nsecond-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,\nand it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),\nhigher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An\nalternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to\nefficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core\ntensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information\nof high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved\nclassification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,\nimages and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior\nclassification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and\nprior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker\nMachines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest\naccuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation.

It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a\ndiverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer\noperations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex\nsemantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We\nemploy a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions\nand produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our\nMultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated\nediting tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively\npreserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe\nMultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse\nand challenging IBIE capabilities.

Conventional approaches, such as\ntrajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,\nwhereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but\nstill necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning\n(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate\nobjectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of\ndirectly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this\nwork introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by\nincorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,\ndirectly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The\nsampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the\ndiscontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time.

To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a\nnovel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph\nlearning (OMCAL).

In this paper, we\nintroduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical\ncoverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination\nthrough a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and\ndynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a\nset of connected subareas.

This allows for incremental refinement\nof the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical\nlayout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots\nexplore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a\nVehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal\nroutes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that\nminimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set\nof subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting\nits coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on\nreal-time sensor observations of the subarea.

Solving it requires addressing three key\nchallenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,\nquadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of\nunknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is\nlimited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by\nlarge obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood\nof finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we\ndemonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and\nmapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging\nsettings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails.

Existing single-view approaches often fail in\nunstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and\ngeneralization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,\nstruggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address\nthese challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a\nMulti-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP\n(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages\nproprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both\nclose-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant\nend-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed\nby the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational\nefficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness\nnear singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world\nenvironments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates\nand reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines.

However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the\nendogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure\naccurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)\nprovides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting\naccuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous\nvariables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage\nfuture exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal\nrelationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their\nperformance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous\nvariables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework\nDAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel\ndimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,\nwe first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal\ndiscovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future\nexogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module\nthat incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of\nforecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous\nvariables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar\ndesign principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical\nexogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal\ninjection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the\nprediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDAG\u7684\u53cc\u56e0\u679c\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6765\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5185\u751f\u4e0e\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "DAG\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u901a\u9053\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u56e0\u679c\u7f51\u7edc\uff0cDAG\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6765\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and\na long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with\ndiverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large\nviewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and\nreference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely\non 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification\nframework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D\nreasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the\nfirst stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for\ngenerating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then\nestimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,\npreventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When\ninvoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a\n3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a\nkeypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences\nbetween query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity\nscoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior\nstate of the art (RoboLLM).

Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this\ngoal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection\nmodule that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the\nVLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable\nconditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation\nstrategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using\nambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the\naction component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the\ninteraction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The\ntraining strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then\ngenerate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router\nthat helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We\nevaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs.

To this\nend, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,\nbending, actuation, and obstacle contact.

We validate our model\nand simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our\nframework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for\nvine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that\nminimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.\nWe show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing\nuncertainties.

Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability\nto capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in\nclinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and\ngeneralizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete\ninputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,\nwe propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for\nmissing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of\nthree synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module\nexplicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and\nmodality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The\nBi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge\nfrom teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial\nfeature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior\nprobabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,\neffectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive\nexperiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM\nconsistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation\naccuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality\nconfigurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six\ncategories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of\nknowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and\nfuture research.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations.

In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the\nattribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS\nstrategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the\ntemporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency.

Code: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs", "summary": "To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based\nmulti-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation\nand then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the\ncomputational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then\ngradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve\ngreat success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion\nmodels gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models\nin MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion\nprocess. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we\ndesign a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve\nefficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net\nand convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling\nstrategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence\nestimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two\nnovel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive\nperformance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.\nCasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and\nETH3D.

However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute\nrelationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the\nconventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off\nrelationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CausalPre\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u89e3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eCausalPre\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CausalPre\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u9700\u727a\u7272\u5173\u7cfb\u8986\u76d6\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\u3002"}}
