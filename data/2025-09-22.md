### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM2VEC4CXR和LLM2CLIP4CXR通过适应临床报告的异质性，提升了胸部X光报告的文本理解和图像-文本对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告存在缩写、风格多样等问题，传统方法在大规模噪声数据上性能受限。

Method: 使用LLM编码器适应临床报告，结合视觉主干构建双塔框架。

Result: 模型在报告理解和临床对齐上优于基线，且具有更强的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性（而非单纯规模）是多模态学习的关键，模型已开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec是一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的推测解码框架，通过轻量级视觉适配器和全局特征向量提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码技术在VLM中效果有限，多模态能力的重要性日益凸显，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: ViSpec使用视觉适配器压缩图像标记，并集成全局特征向量以增强多模态一致性，同时通过专门训练数据集避免捷径学习。

Result: ViSpec在VLM推测解码中首次实现了显著加速。

Conclusion: ViSpec为VLM的高效推理提供了创新解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE是一个多模态合规框架，通过统一处理视觉和文本内容，显著降低了人工审核需求和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合规框架存在碎片化和难以适应动态指南的问题，M-PACE旨在通过多模态大语言模型统一工作流程。

Method: M-PACE采用母-子MLLM架构，通过强大的母模型评估子模型输出，实现自动化质量控制。

Result: 推理成本降低31倍，高效模型（如Gemini 2.0 Flash）每张图像成本仅为0.0005，且准确性相当。

Conclusion: M-PACE在广告合规中展示了高效性和成本效益，为多模态合规提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [4] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion结合深度学习和原子力显微镜（AFM），通过虚拟AFM框架生成多视角合成图像，利用条件扩散模型和NeRF重建3D蛋白质结构，实现了高保真度的结构预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法难以处理大型蛋白质复合体的3D结构预测，而实验方法如Cryo-EM成本高且耗时。

Method: 开发虚拟AFM框架生成合成数据，训练条件扩散模型和NeRF模型进行多视角合成和3D重建。

Result: 重建的3D蛋白质结构在AFM分辨率内达到高保真度，实验验证显示其潜力。

Conclusion: ProFusion为蛋白质复合体结构预测提供了一种准确且经济高效的方法。

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEL框架通过多尺度特征处理和跨模态对齐提升视觉语言模型的可解释性，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在安全关键场景中因复杂对象关系和透明性需求而面临的挑战。

Method: 引入分层语义关系模块，结合梯度解释和多尺度特征处理，增强模型解释能力。

Result: 实验表明MMEL能生成更聚焦且上下文感知的可视化结果，提升模型决策的透明性。

Conclusion: MMEL在多个领域通用，为高可解释性和可靠性应用提供了有价值的模型决策洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NAP的导航感知剪枝方法，用于在视觉与语言导航任务中高效剪枝，减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型在视觉与语言导航任务中表现优异，但计算成本高，传统剪枝方法忽视了任务特定挑战，导致效率提升有限。

Method: 通过导航特定特征（如方向可导航性）预过滤令牌为前景和背景，并利用大语言模型提取导航相关指令，专注于剪枝背景令牌以减少信息损失。

Result: 在标准VLN基准测试中，NAP显著优于先前工作，成功率高且节省超过50%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: NAP通过任务感知剪枝有效平衡了效率与性能，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff是一个新颖的文本到图像生成框架，通过双模块转换提升公平性和安全性，同时保持语义对齐和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升公平性和安全性时往往牺牲语义保真度和图像质量，因此需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 提出双模块学习框架，分别负责公平性/安全性和语义对齐，并通过新的分数匹配目标协调模块。

Result: 在保持图像质量的同时，公平性和语义一致性提升20%，并可无缝集成到SDXL等大型模型中。

Conclusion: RespoDiff在负责任生成任务中优于现有方法，平衡了公平性、安全性和语义对齐。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了自动引导和在线数据选择方法对生成扩散模型训练效率的影响，发现自动引导能显著提升样本质量和多样性，而早期数据选择在数据效率上表现相近但复杂度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过自动引导和在线数据选择方法提高生成扩散模型的训练效率和样本质量。

Method: 整合了联合示例选择（JEST）和自动引导方法，并在2-D合成数据和3x64x64-D图像生成任务上进行评估。

Result: 自动引导显著提升了样本质量和多样性；早期数据选择在数据效率上表现相近但复杂度更高。

Conclusion: 自动引导是提升样本质量的主要驱动力，而数据选择在早期训练中可能带来效率增益，但复杂度较高。

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于频域指纹的AI生成图像溯源方法，通过离散傅里叶变换和线性判别分析实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业环境中需要确保AI生成内容的来源可信，PRISM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM利用离散傅里叶变换的幅值和相位信息，结合线性判别分析进行模型溯源。

Result: 在PRISM-36K数据集上达到92.04%的准确率，在多个基准测试中平均准确率为81.60%。

Conclusion: PRISM证明了频域指纹在跨架构和跨数据集模型溯源中的有效性，提升了生成AI系统的可信度。

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3在心理旋转任务中的表现，发现自监督ViTs比监督ViTs更能捕捉几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代视觉变换器（如ViT、CLIP等）是否具备类似人类的空间推理能力，尤其是心理旋转任务。

Method: 通过层间探测方法，评估不同模型在多种心理旋转任务（从简单到复杂）中的表现。

Result: 自监督ViTs在捕捉几何结构上表现更好；中间层优于最终层；任务难度与旋转复杂性和遮挡相关。

Conclusion: 模型在心理旋转任务中的表现与人类反应时间相似，表明嵌入空间表示存在类似约束。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了未经修改的ViT特征在图像分类和分割任务中的表现，分析了不同token类型和决策规则的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对预训练的ViT特征进行额外处理以提高性能，但缺乏对原始特征内在表示能力的全面分析。

Method: 使用基于超平面或余弦相似度的分类和分割规则，分析不同token类型和预训练模型的表现。

Result: 研究提供了关于token类型和决策规则选择的详细见解，并在两个常用数据集上报告了具体结果。

Conclusion: 研究填补了原始ViT特征分析的空缺，为任务和预训练目标的选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP方法中文本描述不准确和视觉-语言嵌入对齐不足的问题。

Result: 在四个OOD基准测试中验证了CoDoL的有效性。

Conclusion: CoDoL显著提升了视觉-语言嵌入对齐和OOD泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN是一种主动、自适应的视觉模型框架，通过逐步聚焦任务相关区域，显著降低计算成本并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉高效适应复杂环境，而现有机器视觉模型被动处理整个场景，导致资源需求过高，限制了技术进步和实际应用。

Method: AdaptiveNN将视觉感知建模为从粗到细的序列决策过程，结合表示学习和自奖励强化学习进行端到端训练。

Result: 在17个基准测试中，AdaptiveNN实现了高达28倍的计算成本降低，同时保持准确性，并展现出类人的感知行为。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN为高效、灵活和可解释的计算机视觉提供了新方向，并有望成为研究视觉认知的工具。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

### [15] [LowDiff: Efficient Diffusion Sampling with Low-Resolution Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15342)
*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff是一种高效扩散框架，通过多分辨率生成和统一模型逐步细化图像，显著提升采样速度并保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样速度慢，现有方法多关注模型压缩或减少去噪步骤，忽略了多分辨率生成的潜力。

Method: 提出LowDiff框架，采用级联方法从低分辨率逐步生成高分辨率图像，使用统一模型进行细化。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现50%以上的吞吐量提升，生成质量相当或更优，如CIFAR-10 FID 2.11，ImageNet FID 4.00。

Conclusion: LowDiff在效率和生成质量上均表现优异，适用于像素和潜在空间的扩散模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskAttn-SDXL通过区域级门控机制改进SDXL的跨注意力，减少多对象提示中的干扰，提升空间合规性和属性绑定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在多对象、属性和空间关系提示中的组合失败问题。

Method: 在SDXL的UNet跨注意力logits中注入二进制掩码，稀疏化token与潜在空间的交互。

Result: 提升了空间合规性和属性绑定，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: logit级掩码跨注意力是组合控制的有效方法，可作为空间控制的实用扩展。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN提出了一种新的多域图像到图像转换框架，专注于种族特征转换，无需参考图像且保持个体特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN模型在种族特征转换时无法保持个体特征或需要额外参考图像，RaceGAN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RaceGAN通过映射多个域的风格代码来实现种族特征转换，同时保持个体特征和高层次语义。

Result: 在Chicago Face Dataset上，RaceGAN在亚洲、白人和黑人种族特征转换上表现优于其他模型。

Conclusion: RaceGAN有效实现了种族特征转换，并在潜在空间中形成了清晰的种族聚类。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型缺乏透明度，现有解释方法多为局部视觉解释，概念解释需大量标注成本高。

Method: 利用用户定义的部分标签从少量图像扩展到大数据集，聚合局部解释生成全局符号化解释。

Result: 实现了大规模模型决策的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了标注成本，提供了可扩展的全局解释方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模型归因上优于现有方法，适用于伪造检测、版权追踪和身份保护。

Conclusion: 因果指纹能有效反映图像来源与模型痕迹的因果关系，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

*Moinak Bhattacharya,Angelica P. Kurtz,Fabio M. Iwamoto,Prateek Prasanna,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种针对神经肿瘤的特定基础模型，结合分布鲁棒优化（DRO），显著提升了分子标记预测和生存分析的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经肿瘤数据的异质性和复杂性限制了基础模型的泛化能力，尤其是对罕见分子标记的预测效果不佳。

Method: 使用自监督学习预训练模型（BYOL、DINO、MAE、MoCo），并应用DRO解决数据和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在多个任务中表现优异，如分子分类和生存预测，显著提升了罕见标记的预测性能。

Conclusion: 结合DRO的基础模型能生成更鲁棒的特征表示，为精准神经肿瘤学提供了新方向。

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

*Chung-En Johnny Yu,Hsuan-Chih,Chen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA是一个代理推理框架，通过测试时结构化推理提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的事实准确性和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉和对抗攻击的脆弱性，限制了其实际应用的可靠性。

Method: ORCA采用Observe--Reason--Critique--Act循环，利用小型视觉模型进行推理验证，无需访问模型内部或重新训练。

Result: 在POPE幻觉基准测试中，ORCA将LVLM性能提升3.64%至40.67%；在对抗攻击下，平均准确率提升20.11%。

Conclusion: ORCA为构建更可靠和鲁棒的多模态系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAD-Conv是一种新型卷积算子，通过动态调整采样区域形状和大小，增强神经网络对复杂图像结构的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可变形卷积受限于固定四边形采样区域，无法灵活适应图像内容。RAD-Conv旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RAD-Conv为每个核元素使用四个边界偏移，创建可动态调整的矩形采样区域，解耦感受野形状与核结构。

Result: 该方法能精确控制感受野，捕捉局部细节和长程依赖，结合了注意力机制的适应性和标准卷积的高效性。

Conclusion: RAD-Conv为构建更高效、表达能力更强的视觉模型提供了实用方案，填补了传统卷积与注意力方法之间的空白。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Motivation: 传统基于角落的多边形表示对噪声和不完整观测高度敏感，导致布局碎片化或不合理。现有方法在恢复精细几何细节方面仍有不足。

Method: 提出了一种边缘中心化表示方法，将每个墙段建模为几何连续的定向边缘，并设计了双查询Transformer解码器以稳定优化和加速收敛。

Result: 在Structured3D和SceneCAD数据集上，CAGE实现了房间、角落和角度的F1分数分别为99.1%、91.7%和89.3%，表现出优异的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: CAGE通过边缘中心化表示和双查询Transformer解码器，显著提升了矢量平面图重建的鲁棒性和几何细节恢复能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: JEPA 能利用未标记的多模态数据提升模型性能，但需注意其在外部数据中的局限性。

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和多模态大语言模型的发展，多模态数据集（尤其是图像-文本数据集）的重要性显著提升，但现有蒸馏方法因计算资源需求高和耗时长而受限。

Method: 提出了一种生成式蒸馏方法EDGE，通过双向对比损失和多样性损失解决生成图像与标题缺乏关联及样本多样性不足的问题，并引入标题合成策略提升文本-图像检索性能。

Result: 在Flickr30K、COCO和CC3M数据集上验证了方法的优越性和高效性，速度比现有最优方法快18倍。

Conclusion: EDGE为多模态数据集蒸馏提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成系统资源消耗大、设计选择不透明、缺乏公开代码和数据集的问题。

Method: 基于预训练开源模型，分别优化图像标记器、世界模型和视频解码器，并通过公开数据集BDD100K进行微调。

Result: 在256x256分辨率、4fps下，仅需一帧算法延迟即可生成逼真的驾驶场景视频。

Conclusion: OpenViGA通过开源模型和数据集，提供了高效、可复现的视频生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

Motivation: 研究基础模型在计算病理学中的表示结构和变异性，以优化模型开发和部署。

Method: 使用计算神经科学技术对六种基础模型进行表示相似性分析，评估切片和疾病依赖性。

Result: UNI2和Virchow2表示结构最独特，Prov-Gigapath相似性最高；染色归一化显著减少切片依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究为改进模型鲁棒性和集成策略提供了见解，框架可扩展至其他医学影像领域。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型通常依赖大型模型，计算和内存需求高，难以在资源受限环境中部署，而空间推理能力在工业应用中至关重要。

Method: SmolRGPT采用三阶段课程学习，逐步对齐视觉和语言特征，理解空间关系，并适应任务特定数据集。

Conclusion: SmolRGPT展示了在资源受限环境中高效部署多模态智能的潜力，同时保持核心空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from
a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity
fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert
ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for
conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen
reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

*Junbiao Pang,Tianyang Cai,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEC-Quant是一种新的量化感知训练方法，通过最大化熵编码减少量化偏差，提升低比特量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化会引入偏差，尤其在低比特设置下，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出MEC-Quant，利用最小编码长度作为熵的替代目标，结合MOE实现可扩展优化。

Result: 在多种视觉任务中表现优异，首次将QAT极限推至x-bit，性能接近或超越全精度模型。

Conclusion: MEC-Quant为QAT设立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法在高分辨率截图中难以实现细粒度定位，GUI-ARP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合自适应区域感知（ARP）和自适应阶段控制（ASC），动态利用视觉注意力裁剪任务相关区域，并通过两阶段训练（监督微调与基于GRPO的强化微调）实现。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和UI-Vision基准测试中分别达到60.8%和30.9%的准确率，性能优于开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: GUI-ARP在GUI定位任务中表现出色，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

TL;DR: SAMPO是一种结合视觉自回归建模和因果建模的混合框架，用于提升世界模型的时空一致性和生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归世界模型在视觉一致性预测上存在空间结构破坏、解码效率低和运动建模不足的问题。

Method: SAMPO整合了时间因果解码和双向空间注意力，设计了非对称多尺度分词器和轨迹感知运动提示模块。

Result: SAMPO在视频预测和模型控制中表现优异，生成质量提升且推理速度快4.4倍，具备零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: SAMPO通过混合建模和动态优化，显著提升了世界模型的预测能力和效率。

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注情感和情绪识别，忽视了欲望理解，且多模态方法中图像作为非语言线索的作用未被充分探索。

Method: 采用对称双向多模态学习框架，结合低分辨率和高分辨率图像，通过掩码图像建模和交叉模态解码器增强特征捕捉能力。

Result: 在MSED数据集上，欲望理解、情感识别和情绪分析的F1分数分别提升了1.1%、0.6%和0.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态欲望、情感和情绪识别任务中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

Result: 在MeViS测试集上达到64.14%的J&F分数，排名ICCV 2025 LSVOS挑战赛第二。

Conclusion: 无需额外训练即可显著提升性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外照片集因稀疏视图和多外观（如不同时间或季节）导致的场景重建和视图合成难题。

Method: 利用单目深度估计的几何先验，结合SfM点锚定算法提取局部语义区域，并通过几何引导的虚拟视图监督提升一致性。

Result: MS-GS在稀疏视图和多外观条件下实现逼真渲染，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-GS通过几何和语义优化，有效提升了稀疏视图场景的重建和渲染质量。

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Motivation: 多标签分类需要强大的表示能力以捕捉标签间交互，Diff-Feat通过融合图像和文本的中间特征实现这一目标。

Method: 提取扩散Transformer模型的中间特征，设计启发式局部搜索算法找到最优特征组合，通过线性投影融合。

Result: 在MS-COCO-enhanced和Visual Genome 500上分别达到98.6%和45.7%的mAP，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Diff-Feat通过融合多模态特征实现了更紧密的语义聚类和卓越的分类性能。

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Conclusion: AI开发和流程数字化需作为端到端迭代协同设计过程，以填补实际应用中的知识缺口。

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

TL;DR: DC-Mamba是一个基于ChangeMamba的框架，通过BTDA和SSCA模块解决遥感变化检测中的几何错位和噪声问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SSMs）缺乏处理几何错位和区分细微变化的机制，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出"align-then-enhance"框架，集成BTDA（双时态可变形对齐）和SSCA（尺度稀疏变化放大器）模块。

Result: F1-score从0.5730提升至0.5903，IoU从0.4015提升至0.4187。

Conclusion: DC-Mamba通过几何对齐和特征增强，有效解决了遥感变化检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

Conclusion: BTL框架在开发高级GUI代理方面具有显著效果，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Conclusion: 新方法解决了评估偏差，提升了SOD的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable

develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery

TL;DR: TennisTV是一个针对网球视频理解的综合基准测试，揭示了多模态大语言模型在快速运动中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在一般视频理解中表现优异，但在快速、高频的网球运动中表现不佳，因此需要系统评估其能力。

Method: 通过自动化流程构建TennisTV基准，将每个回合建模为时间顺序的击球事件序列，生成2500个人工验证的问题。

Result: 评估16个代表性模型，发现其在网球视频理解中存在显著不足，并提出帧采样密度和时序定位改进的建议。

Conclusion: TennisTV为网球视频理解提供了首个系统评估，揭示了模型改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于病理报告辅助的自蒸馏框架（Rasa），用于WSI生存分析，通过LLM提取文本特征并优化WSI特征，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI生存分析存在特征噪声和数据不足问题，病理报告的潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 利用LLM提取病理报告的文本特征，设计自蒸馏管道过滤WSI冗余特征，并引入风险感知混合策略增强数据。

Result: 在CRC和TCGA-BRCA数据集上，Rasa表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Rasa框架有效结合病理报告与WSI特征，提升了生存分析的性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级协同轨迹预测框架CoPAD，结合匈牙利算法和卡尔曼滤波的融合模块，以及多个注意力模块和解码器，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单车辆感知的不稳定性限制了轨迹预测的性能，因此需要一种协同预测方法来提升预测效果。

Method: CoPAD框架包含基于匈牙利算法和卡尔曼滤波的融合模块、历史时间注意力模块（PTA）、模式注意力模块和锚点导向解码器（AoD）。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-Seq数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CoPAD在V2X场景下的协同轨迹预测中表现出色，验证了模型的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

*Zhuoyao Liu,Yang Liu,Wentao Feng,Shudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSR框架通过伪标签一致性增强跨模态检索的鲁棒性，有效处理噪声数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设图像-文本对完美对齐，忽略了真实数据中的噪声对应关系，导致检索性能下降。

Method: 提出PCSR框架，通过伪标签一致性区分和优化噪声样本，并采用自适应优化策略。

Result: 在CC152K、MS-COCO和Flickr30K数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PCSR显著提升了噪声监督下的检索鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在物体边界处深度估计模糊，需要精细监督，而本文旨在仅通过自监督实现清晰的深度不连续性。

Method: 将像素深度建模为混合分布，通过方差感知损失函数和不确定性传播集成到现有流程中。

Result: 在KITTI和VKITTIv2数据集上，边界清晰度提升35%，点云质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过混合分布建模和自监督，显著提升了深度估计的边界清晰度和整体质量。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上验证了性能提升、跨域适应性和通信开销减少。

Conclusion: 该框架在医学图像分割中表现出色，适用于异构数据场景。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Motivation: 解决RGB和红外模态在跨模态场景中性能不足的问题，特别是在自动驾驶等应用中。

Method: 采用生物启发的注意力引导蒸馏框架（PCCL）和双知识保留机制，结合LoRA适配器和同步蒸馏。

Result: 在红外任务中性能显著提升（语义分割+1.7 mIoU，目标检测+0.7 mAP），同时保持RGB任务99%以上的基线性能。

Conclusion: UNIV模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，为多模态感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GS-Scale是一种高效的内存优化系统，用于大规模3D高斯泼溅训练，显著降低GPU内存需求并保持训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D高斯泼溅训练因GPU内存需求过高而受限，GS-Scale旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GS-Scale通过选择性卸载几何参数、参数转发和延迟优化器更新等技术，减少GPU内存使用。

Result: GS-Scale将GPU内存需求降低3.3-5.6倍，并在消费级GPU上实现大规模训练，性能提升23-35%。

Conclusion: GS-Scale成功解决了大规模3D高斯泼溅训练的内存瓶颈，适用于消费级硬件。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Conclusion: 基于PCA的模型在不完整点云数据表面重建中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人类扫视视觉的两阶段方法，用于细粒度视觉分类，通过减少空间冗余和优化特征提取，性能优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类因类内差异大和类间差异小而具有挑战性，现有方法存在空间冗余和特征利用不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：先提取外围特征生成样本图，再通过权重共享编码器并行编码注视区域，使用选择性注意力加权融合特征。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上表现优异，性能接近最先进方法，且优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化特征提取和减少冗余，有效提升了细粒度视觉分类的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

Motivation: 解决大规模3D-文本数据集稀缺问题，丰富数据复杂性和多样性。

Method: 利用单个3D形状构建多对象场景，结合语言模型生成描述，增强对比训练。

Result: 在多个任务（如零样本分类、少样本分割、视觉问答）中表现优异。

Conclusion: SceneForge的模型无关性使其适用于多种编码架构，并展现出强大的空间推理能力。

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在对象与上下文不符时容易出错，需要系统性评估其识别能力。

Method: 使用LLM和CLIP引导的采样策略，构建ORIC基准测试，评估18个LVLMs和两个开放词汇检测模型。

Result: 结果显示模型在上下文不符时存在显著的识别差距。

Conclusion: ORIC揭示了LVLMs的局限性，推动对上下文感知对象识别的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Motivation: 云相剖面直接影响辐射传输和降水过程，对数值天气预报至关重要。

Method: 利用高时空分辨率的多波段可见光和热红外图像，结合空间激光雷达和雷达的垂直云相剖面数据，构建同步图像-剖面对数据集，并采用SGMAGNet等模型进行预测。

Result: SGMAGNet在复杂多层和边界过渡区域的云相重建中表现优异，精确度、召回率、F1分数和IoU均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SGMAGNet在多模态卫星观测转化为3D云相结构的任务中表现出色，为未来集成到数值天气预报系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

Method: 构建MedForensics数据集，提出DSKI检测器，结合跨域微迹适配器和医学取证检索模块。

Result: DSKI在多种医学模态中显著优于现有方法和人类专家。

Conclusion: MedForensics和DSKI为医学图像取证提供了有效工具，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法构建单一判别空间难以泛化到未知生成模式，TrueMoE旨在通过多专家协作解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双路由机制（稀疏路由器和密集路由器）将输入图像分配给最相关的专家，专家阵列沿流形结构和感知粒度组织。

Result: 在多种生成模型上的实验表明，TrueMoE具有优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TrueMoE通过多专家协作和双路由机制，显著提升了合成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

Result: 提供了对感受野响应关系的深入理解，可用于设计高效计算方案和生物视觉理论模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果为多参数感受野家族的计算和生物视觉模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Conclusion: FloorSAM通过结合点云和SAM，显著提升了平面图重建的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Conclusion: 研究使视觉表征学习模型更接近人类真实学习过程，性能更优。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD基准数据集仅基于RGB，缺乏对多光谱方法的支持，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 引入MCOD数据集，包含真实场景中的挑战性属性、多样化场景和高质量像素级标注。

Result: 在多光谱模态下，COD方法的性能下降得到显著缓解，验证了光谱信息的价值。

Conclusion: MCOD为多光谱伪装目标检测的未来研究提供了坚实基础，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized

surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

Motivation: 现有SDS方法依赖CLIP文本编码器导致语义对齐粗糙，且2D扩散先验缺乏3D空间约束，导致几何不一致和多物体场景关系不准确。

Method: VLM3D将VLMs集成到SDS流程中，利用其语言基础和空间理解能力，提供细粒度语义对齐和3D一致性。

Conclusion: VLM3D通过VLMs的引入，解决了SDS方法的局限性，为文本到3D生成提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications

modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统方法使用全局均匀平滑约束，无法适应解剖运动中复杂的区域变化变形。

Method: SegReg通过分割将图像分解为解剖一致子区域，利用相同注册骨干计算局部变形场，最终整合为全局变形场。

Conclusion: SegReg将配准问题转化为分割问题，显著提升了复杂解剖变形的处理能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

Conclusion: CBPNet有效解决了塑性损失问题，提升了持续学习的性能，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or

TL;DR: TASAM扩展了SAM，针对遥感图像分割，通过地形和时间感知模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在自然图像分割表现优秀，但在遥感数据中因地形复杂、多尺度对象和时间动态性而表现不佳。

Method: TASAM引入三个轻量模块：地形感知适配器、时间提示生成器和多尺度融合策略。

Result: 在三个遥感基准测试中表现优于零样本SAM和任务专用模型，计算开销低。

Conclusion: TASAM展示了领域自适应增强的价值，为地理空间分割提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

TL;DR: ChronoForge-RL结合TAD和KF-GRPO，通过关键帧选择和强化学习提升视频理解效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集视频内容处理的计算不可行性和语义关键帧识别困难。

Method: 提出三阶段关键帧选择机制（TAD）和强化学习模块（KF-GRPO）。

Result: 在VideoMME和LVBench上分别达到69.1%和52.7%，性能超越基线方法。

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL显著提升视频理解效率，性能接近更大规模模型。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在未充分研究的品牌偏见问题，可能带来伦理和法律风险。

Method: CIDER使用轻量级检测器和视觉语言模型识别品牌内容并生成风格多样的替代方案。

Result: CIDER显著减少了显性和隐性偏见，同时保持图像质量和美学吸引力。

Conclusion: CIDER为生成更原创和公平的内容提供了实用解决方案，有助于构建可信的生成式AI。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于知识迁移的主动学习不确定性估计方法，适用于多种任务，尤其是计算生物学中的cryo-ET分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂辅助模型和特殊训练方式，难以适用于特定领域任务。

Method: 利用教师-学生模式，教师为任务模型，学生为辅助模型，通过模型输出距离衡量不确定性。

Result: 在计算机视觉和cryo-ET任务中验证了方法的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: 数据不确定性与任务损失上界密切相关，而非具体损失值，方法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在稀疏监督下生成的土地覆盖图存在碎片化和噪声问题，对象级分类方法有望解决这一问题。

Method: LC-SLab结合图神经网络输入级聚合和语义分割模型输出级聚合，并利用预训练网络提升小数据集性能。

Result: 对象级方法在保持精度的同时显著提升地图连贯性，输入级聚合在小数据集上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: LC-SLab框架在稀疏监督下优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DVG方法在3D高斯泼溅中空间纹理隐式表示和大量标注数据需求的问题。

Method: 利用对象级视图检索从多视角收集定位线索，将3DVG转化为2D检索任务。

Result: 在避免场景训练的同时实现了最先进的视觉定位性能。

Conclusion: 为零样本3DVG研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Motivation: 解决在有限数据和计算预算下实现高性能的3D医学图像分割问题。

Method: 结合SegResNet编码器、提示编码器和掩码解码器，使用相对位置编码和Muon优化器。

Result: 在CVPR 2025挑战赛中表现优异，DSC AUC为2.404，NSD AUC为2.266，超越部分基线模型。

Conclusion: ENSAM在有限资源下表现优异，相对位置编码和Muon优化器显著提升性能。

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a
lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation.
ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

Motivation: 解决2D图像与3D点云配准中的语义-几何鸿沟和局部最优问题。

Method: 结合几何-语义融合嵌入空间和粗到细的配准策略，采用动态训练机制平衡损失。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上分别提升23.7%和37.9%。

Conclusion: CrossI2P在精度和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在关系建模方面存在挑战：语义提示表示过于粗粒度，缺乏对图像对象及其语义关系的显式建模。

Method: 提出RACap模型，挖掘检索描述中的结构化关系语义，并识别图像中的异质对象。

Result: 实验表明，RACap仅需10.8M可训练参数，性能优于之前的轻量级描述模型。

Conclusion: RACap通过结构化关系特征和异质视觉信息，显著提升了图像描述的语义一致性和关系表达能力。

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

Motivation: 现有体素和点基方法计算成本高且效率低，而range-view方法可以利用成熟的2D分割技术实现快速准确预测。

Method: 通过修改SAM2编码器结构，包括强调水平空间依赖、定制几何配置和适应range-view空间模式，优化了range-view表示。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上取得竞争性表现，同时保持了2D管道的速度和部署简便性。

Conclusion: VFMs可作为3D感知的通用骨干，为LiDAR分割开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代算法在遮挡、无纹理或重复模式区域表现不佳，缺乏全局上下文和几何信息。

Method: 提出GREAT框架，包含空间注意力（SA）、匹配注意力（MA）和体积注意力（VA）模块，增强全局上下文和几何细节。

Result: GREAT-IGEV在Scene Flow、KITTI 2015和ETH3D上排名第一，Middlebury第二。

Conclusion: GREAT框架有效提升立体匹配性能，尤其在复杂区域表现优异。

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

Result: DFMs在物体识别和分割任务中表现优于前馈网络，尤其在低数据或高噪声情况下。

Conclusion: 反馈机制对实现稳定、鲁棒和可泛化的学习至关重要。

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

Result: 在稀疏视图场景中显著优于现有技术，在密集采样场景中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放词汇3D物体检测提供了简单而强大的基线解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化影响了天气、土壤肥力和农场管理系统，使得精确的产量预测变得复杂。现有方法在处理多光谱数据时存在困难，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: MTMS-YieldNet利用对比学习进行特征提取，专注于从遥感数据中捕捉空间-光谱模式和时空依赖性。

Result: MTMS-YieldNet在Sentinel-1、Landsat-8和Sentinel-2上的MAPE得分分别为0.336、0.353和0.331，优于七种现有方法。

Conclusion: MTMS-YieldNet不仅提高了产量预测的准确性，还为农民提供了有价值的决策支持，有望提升作物产量。

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了单目深度估计（MDE）的可解释性，评估了多种特征归因方法，并提出了新的评估指标Attribution Fidelity。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MDE在现实应用中广泛部署，但其可解释性尚未充分探索，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了Saliency Maps、Integrated Gradients和Attention Rollout等方法，并在轻量级网络METER和深度网络PixelFormer上进行了实验。

Result: Saliency Maps和Integrated Gradients分别在轻量级和深度模型中表现良好；Attribution Fidelity能有效识别不可靠的可视化解释。

Conclusion: 研究为MDE的可解释性提供了实用方法，并验证了新指标的有效性。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

TL;DR: MuproCL提出了一种多原型框架，解决了语言引导持续学习中的语义模糊性和类内视觉多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖单一语义目标，导致语义模糊和视觉多样性不足。

Method: 使用轻量级LLM代理生成上下文感知的多原型，并通过LogSumExp机制自适应对齐。

Result: 实验表明MuproCL显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MuproCL为语言引导持续学习提供了更有效的路径。

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像匹配由于模态间显著的外观差异和高质量标注数据的稀缺，现有深度学习方法表现不佳且缺乏适应性。

Method: DistillMatch通过知识蒸馏从VFM（如DINOv2/DINOv3）中提取高级语义特征，并注入模态类别信息以增强跨模态相关性理解，同时设计了V2I-GAN进行数据增强。

Result: 实验表明，DistillMatch在公共数据集上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: DistillMatch通过知识蒸馏和模态信息注入，有效解决了多模态图像匹配的挑战，提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

Motivation: 现实场景中多视图数据往往只有部分对齐，传统方法依赖完全对齐假设，性能受限。

Method: 采用因果建模，将部分对齐数据视为干预，设计变分自编码器估计不变特征，并引入对比正则化。

Result: 实验表明CauMVC在完全和部分对齐数据上均具有强泛化性和有效性。

Conclusion: CauMVC首次通过因果学习解决广义多视图聚类问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

Motivation: 现有VSR方法对真实世界中的光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化等视觉挑战关注不足，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: GLip采用双路径特征提取架构，结合全局和局部特征，通过两阶段渐进学习（粗对齐和上下文增强模块）优化视觉-语音映射。

Result: GLip在LRS2、LRS3基准测试和新引入的普通话数据集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLip通过渐进学习策略和局部特征增强，有效提升了VSR在复杂视觉条件下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖法线或固定数量的控制点，难以处理噪声点云数据。

Method: 使用字典引导的图卷积网络同时预测控制点的位置和数量。

Result: 在质量和数量上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声点云表面重建中表现出色，无需法线信息。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉特征的隐式模式识别，缺乏上下文推理和可解释性。

Method: 扩展MLLM词汇表，引入<ACT>和<GROUP>标记，设计多模态双对齐融合模块（MDAF）结合视觉特征。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明LIR-GAD在群体活动检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LIR-GAD通过语言指令推理和多模态融合显著提升了群体活动检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Motivation: 现有方法多依赖深度或点云等模态提升空间推理，而纯视觉空间理解尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过最大化语义丰富性采样提取关键帧，并模拟视觉轨迹以编码空间关系。

Result: 在VSI-BENCH和STI-BENCH上，SEE&TREK显著提升MLLMs的空间推理性能，最高提升3.5%。

Conclusion: SEE&TREK为增强空间智能提供了一种高效且无需训练的方法。

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种高效的自监督去噪解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体体育场景中，不同角色（如球员和球）和不同体育领域间的动态分布差异导致现有统一框架难以捕捉结构化分布变化，泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AdaSports-Traj框架，包含角色和领域感知适配器，通过分层对比学习目标分别监督角色敏感和领域感知表示。

Result: 在Basketball-U、Football-U和Soccer-U三个数据集上验证了框架的有效性，在统一和跨领域轨迹预测中表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj通过自适应设计成功解决了多智能体体育场景中的轨迹预测问题，提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

Motivation: 由于3D训练数据通常不如2D图像数据充足，SegDINO3D旨在充分利用预训练的2D检测模型中的图像级和对象级特征，以改进3D表示。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和ScanNet200基准测试中，SegDINO3D表现最佳，尤其在ScanNet200上，验证集和隐藏测试集的mAP分别显著提高了+8.7和+6.8。

Conclusion: SegDINO3D通过有效结合2D和3D特征，显著提升了3D实例分割的性能，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和View-of-Delft数据集上实现了最优检测精度和更快的推理速度。

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D在自动驾驶中具有实时部署潜力。

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏测量下有效恢复几何信息，并展示了硬件解决方案的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Method: 提出训练免费的知识蒸馏技术，利用大语言模型增强提示信息。

Result: 最佳模型生成准确性提升72%，显著改善图像生成质量。

Conclusion: 系统整合语言知识可显著提升T2I模型在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理图像输入时表现出明显的视觉谄媚行为，称为“谄媚模态间隙”。通过提出Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法，显著减少了谄媚行为，同时避免了过度固执。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLLMs在处理图像输入时表现出的视觉谄媚行为，并探索如何缓解这一问题。

Method: 首先尝试监督微调，但发现会导致模型过度固执；随后提出SRT方法，通过反思推理判断用户指令的误导性或正确性。

Result: SRT显著减少了谄媚行为，同时避免了过度固执。

Conclusion: SRT有效缓解了MLLMs的视觉谄媚行为，平衡了误导性和纠正性指令的处理。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

Conclusion: 混合分词器设计有效，模型规模扩展带来一致增益，任务冲突最小。

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种即插即用的轻量级解决方案，适用于现有视觉语言模型，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

Motivation: 现实部署中多模态图像分割常因模态缺失或损坏导致性能下降，现有方法需为每种模态组合训练专门模型，成本高且不灵活。

Method: 提出UniMRSeg，通过输入、特征和输出层次的分层自监督补偿（HSSC）桥接完整与缺失模态间的表示差距，包括模态重建、模态不变对比学习和轻量反向注意力适配器。

Conclusion: UniMRSeg提供了一种高效、灵活的多模态图像分割解决方案，无需为每种模态组合训练专门模型。

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

Conclusion: 优化算法在不牺牲分割质量的前提下，显著提升计算效率，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保留类别上保持预测性能，同时有效擦除遗忘类别，具备隐私和安全性保障。

Conclusion: 通过将可移除性嵌入架构本身，为设计模块化、可扩展且符合伦理的AI模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed multimedia analysis by enabling robust and
transferable representations across diverse modalities and tasks. However,
their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands
-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by
privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,
including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often
computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or
continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:
rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in
capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies
knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than
encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics
to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by
removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or
access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves
predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten
ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security
guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal
prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.
This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against
unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for
deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding
removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new
foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.

Conclusion: MPNP-DDI为药物安全监测和精准医疗提供了强大的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is crucial for medication
safety and effective drug development. However, existing methods often struggle
to capture structural information across different scales, from local
functional groups to global molecular topology, and typically lack mechanisms
to quantify prediction confidence. To address these limitations, we propose
MPNP-DDI, a novel Multi-scale Graph Neural Process framework. The core of
MPNP-DDI is a unique message-passing scheme that, by being iteratively applied,
learns a hierarchy of graph representations at multiple scales. Crucially, a
cross-drug co-attention mechanism then dynamically fuses these multi-scale
representations to generate context-aware embeddings for interacting drug
pairs, while an integrated neural process module provides principled
uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNP-DDI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. By
providing accurate, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware predictions built upon
multi-scale structural features, MPNP-DDI represents a powerful computational
tool for pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy risk assessment, and precision
medicine.

convergence of GenAI and wireless sensing from two complementary perspectives.
First, we explore how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing pipelines,
focusing on two modes of integration: as a plugin to augment task-specific
models and as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. Second, we analyze
the characteristics of mainstream generative models, such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion
models, and discuss their applicability and unique advantages across various
wireless sensing tasks. We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to
wireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation
model: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and
efficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.

Conclusion: IEFS-GMB提高了EEG分类的准确性和可解释性，适用于临床环境。

Abstract: Deep learning-based EEG classification is crucial for the automated detection
of neurological disorders, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
intervention. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals limits
model performance, making feature selection (FS) vital for optimizing
representations learned by neural network encoders. Existing FS methods are
seldom designed specifically for EEG diagnosis; many are architecture-dependent
and lack interpretability, limiting their applicability. Moreover, most rely on
single-iteration data, resulting in limited robustness to variability. To
address these issues, we propose IEFS-GMB, an Information Entropy-based Feature
Selection method guided by a Gradient Memory Bank. This approach constructs a
dynamic memory bank storing historical gradients, computes feature importance
via information entropy, and applies entropy-based weighting to select
informative EEG features. Experiments on four public neurological disease
datasets show that encoders enhanced with IEFS-GMB achieve accuracy
improvements of 0.64% to 6.45% over baseline models. The method also
outperforms four competing FS techniques and improves model interpretability,
supporting its practical use in clinical settings.

Abstract: Understanding the real-world effects of recreational drug use remains a
critical challenge in public health and biomedical research, especially as
traditional surveillance systems often underrepresent user experiences. In this
study, we leverage social media (specifically Twitter) as a rich and unfiltered
source of user-reported effects associated with three emerging psychoactive
substances: ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B. By combining a curated list of slang terms
with biomedical concept extraction via MetaMap, we identified and weakly
annotated over 92,000 tweets mentioning these substances. Each tweet was
labeled with a polarity reflecting whether it reported a positive or negative
effect, following an expert-guided heuristic process. We then performed
descriptive and comparative analyses of the reported phenotypic outcomes across
substances and trained multiple machine learning classifiers to predict
polarity from tweet content, accounting for strong class imbalance using
techniques such as cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling. The top
performance on the test set was obtained from eXtreme Gradient Boosting with
cost-sensitive learning (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934). Our findings reveal that
Twitter enables the detection of substance-specific phenotypic effects, and
that polarity classification models can support real-time pharmacovigilance and
drug effect characterization with high accuracy.

Abstract: The process by which Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire complex
capabilities during training remains a key open question in mechanistic
interpretability. This project investigates whether these learning dynamics can
be characterized through the lens of Complex Network Theory (CNT). I introduce
a novel methodology to represent a Transformer-based LLM as a directed,
weighted graph where nodes are the model's computational components (attention
heads and MLPs) and edges represent causal influence, measured via an
intervention-based ablation technique. By tracking the evolution of this
component-graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on a
canonical induction task, I analyze a suite of graph-theoretic metrics. The
results reveal that the network's structure evolves through distinct phases of
exploration, consolidation, and refinement. Specifically, I identify the
emergence of a stable hierarchy of information spreader components and a
dynamic set of information gatherer components, whose roles reconfigure at key
learning junctures. This work demonstrates that a component-level network
perspective offers a powerful macroscopic lens for visualizing and
understanding the self-organizing principles that drive the formation of
functional circuits in LLMs.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving
expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both
accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical
reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our
Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets
with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented
diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning
trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,
we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core
reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive
hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers
substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much
larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and
consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results
demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and
verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple

Abstract: Printed Electronics (PE) provide a flexible, cost-efficient alternative to
silicon for implementing machine learning (ML) circuits, but their large
feature sizes limit classifier complexity. Leveraging PE's low fabrication and
NRE costs, designers can tailor hardware to specific ML models, simplifying
circuit design. This work explores alternative arithmetic and proposes a hybrid
unary-binary architecture that removes costly encoders and enables efficient,
multiplier-less execution of MLP classifiers. We also introduce
architecture-aware training to further improve area and power efficiency.
Evaluation on six datasets shows average reductions of 46% in area and 39% in
power, with minimal accuracy loss, surpassing other state-of-the-art MLP
designs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Kuramoto动态的生成模型，用于处理具有方向性模式的图像生成问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统各向同性扩散方法难以建模方向性图像（如指纹和纹理），受生物系统中相位同步启发，提出新方法。

Method: 利用Kuramoto动态构建分数生成模型，通过同步和去同步过程实现图像生成。

Result: 在通用图像基准测试中表现优异，方向性密集数据集（如指纹）生成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 生物启发的同步动态可作为生成模型的结构化先验，具有潜力。

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GPLASC的对比学习策略，通过全局预固定和局部调整来解决持续学习中的任务间和任务内特征混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，对比损失虽然能构建更可迁移且不易遗忘的表示，但仍存在任务间和任务内特征混淆的问题。

Method: GPLASC将表示空间划分为非重叠区域，使用ETF预固定任务间特征，同时在任务内调整特征结构。

Result: 实验验证了GPLASC的有效性，能够同时保证任务间和任务内的判别性特征结构。

Conclusion: GPLASC是一种简单有效的策略，可无缝集成到现有对比持续学习框架中。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分拆共形预测的覆盖率在单次校准中波动大，影响实际风险控制。

Method: 提出Small Sample Beta Correction (SSBC)，利用有限样本分布调整显著性水平。

Result: SSBC在用户定义的概率下，确保预测覆盖率至少达到目标水平。

Conclusion: SSBC有效解决了单次校准中覆盖率波动的问题，提升了风险控制能力。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with
guaranteed marginal coverage. However, in split conformal prediction this
guarantee is training-conditional only in expectation: across many calibration
draws, the average coverage equals the nominal level, but the realized coverage
for a single calibration set may vary substantially. This variance undermines
effective risk control in practical applications. Here we introduce the Small
Sample Beta Correction (SSBC), a plug-and-play adjustment to the conformal
significance level that leverages the exact finite-sample distribution of
conformal coverage to provide probabilistic guarantees, ensuring that with
user-defined probability over the calibration draw, the deployed predictor
achieves at least the desired coverage.

Abstract: Recent work has investigated the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
as zero-shot models for generating individual-level characteristics (e.g., to
serve as risk models or augment survey datasets). However, when should a user
have confidence that an LLM will provide high-quality predictions for their
particular task? To address this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study of LLMs' zero-shot predictive capabilities across a wide range of tabular
prediction tasks. We find that LLMs' performance is highly variable, both on
tasks within the same dataset and across different datasets. However, when the
LLM performs well on the base prediction task, its predicted probabilities
become a stronger signal for individual-level accuracy. Then, we construct
metrics to predict LLMs' performance at the task level, aiming to distinguish
between tasks where LLMs may perform well and where they are likely unsuitable.
We find that some of these metrics, each of which are assessed without labeled
data, yield strong signals of LLMs' predictive performance on new tasks.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative
algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to
solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering
data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in
critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial
robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid
theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the
presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we
study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with
$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.
Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized
unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial
Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial
generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with
respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further
present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating
our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the
family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial
robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖严格的独立性假设，样本效率低且缺乏收敛保证，AC-SMFG旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用单循环结构，交替更新领导者、代表跟随者和平均场的策略，基于连续生成的马尔可夫样本。

Result: 算法在有限时间和样本下收敛到Stackelberg目标的稳定点，并在实验中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: AC-SMFG是首个具有非渐进收敛保证的Stackelberg MFG算法，放宽了独立性假设，性能优越。

Abstract: We study policy optimization in Stackelberg mean field games (MFGs), a
hierarchical framework for modeling the strategic interaction between a single
leader and an infinitely large population of homogeneous followers. The
objective can be formulated as a structured bi-level optimization problem, in
which the leader needs to learn a policy maximizing its reward, anticipating
the response of the followers. Existing methods for solving these (and related)
problems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the
leader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to
nested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.
To address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic
algorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The
algorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a
representative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in
practice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the
algorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge,
this is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees. Our key assumption is a "gradient alignment" condition, which
requires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a
partial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence
assumption. Simulation results in a range of well-established economics
environments demonstrate that AC-SMFG outperforms existing multi-agent and MFG
learning baselines in policy quality and convergence speed.

Result: 在能源相关数据集上，VMDNet在强周期性数据中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VMDNet能有效捕捉周期性模式，且在弱周期性下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: In time series forecasting, capturing recurrent temporal patterns is
essential; decomposition techniques make such structure explicit and thereby
improve predictive performance. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a
powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has
seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer
from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To
address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that
(i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed
mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient
learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to
adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and
the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets
demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is
strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns
while remaining robust under weak periodicity.

Abstract: Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision
variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While
various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack
adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal
convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior
knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive
algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization
problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and
nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp
convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$
in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound
on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without
prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in
both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first
adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical
optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization
technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Standard Behavior Cloning (BC) fails to learn multimodal driving decisions,
where multiple valid actions exist for the same scenario. We explore Implicit

using better initialization for derivative-free inference. Experiments in the

standard IBC in urban driving tasks designed to evaluate multimodal behavior
learning in a test environment. The learned energy landscapes are able to

Conclusion: RAMPART为重要特征排名提供了高效且理论支持的方法，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Accurate ranking of important features is a fundamental challenge in
interpretable machine learning with critical applications in scientific
discovery and decision-making. Unlike feature selection and feature importance,
the specific problem of ranking important features has received considerably
less attention. We introduce RAMPART (Ranked Attributions with MiniPatches And
Recursive Trimming), a framework that utilizes any existing feature importance
measure in a novel algorithm specifically tailored for ranking the top-$k$
features. Our approach combines an adaptive sequential halving strategy that
progressively focuses computational resources on promising features with an
efficient ensembling technique using both observation and feature subsampling.
Unlike existing methods that convert importance scores to ranks as
post-processing, our framework explicitly optimizes for ranking accuracy. We
provide theoretical guarantees showing that RAMPART achieves the correct
top-$k$ ranking with high probability under mild conditions, and demonstrate
through extensive simulation studies that RAMPART consistently outperforms
popular feature importance methods, concluding with a high-dimensional genomics
case study.

Conclusion: 该方法在保留PCA可解释性的同时，实现了更稳健的稀疏主成分推断，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells
but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR
amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,
making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous
datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on
principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its
interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix
Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal
components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel
biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that
simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use
of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering
sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains
the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of
sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and
four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves
the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,
autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Abstract: Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the
field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,
they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities
with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the
attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales
from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to
incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based
on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar
problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in
this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a
mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then
mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct
from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived
formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard
Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the
hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an
efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived
attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the
proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train
transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it
can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained
transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in
zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: IMPQ通过考虑层间交互，显著提升了低比特量化下LLMs的性能，适用于严格内存约束场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise impressive capabilities, yet their
multi-billion-parameter scale makes on-device or low-resource deployment
prohibitive. Mixed-precision quantization offers a compelling solution, but
existing methods struggle when the average precision drops below four bits, as
they rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics that overlook critical
inter-layer interactions affecting overall performance. In this paper, we
propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the
mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and
introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to
efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and
inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose
Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these
Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning
either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models
across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's
scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying
solely on isolated metrics. Across average precisions spanning 4 bit down to 2
bit, IMPQ cuts Perplexity by 20 to 80 percent relative to the best baseline,
with the margin growing as the bit-width tightens.

Conclusion: 结合时间推理和知识图谱动态更新对提升大语言模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many language understanding tasks but
struggle to reason over knowledge that evolves. To address this, recent work
has explored augmenting LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide structured,
up-to-date information. However, many existing approaches assume a static
snapshot of the KG and overlook the temporal dynamics and factual
inconsistencies inherent in real-world data. To address the challenge of
reasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a
temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity
grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To
ensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce
EvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG
from unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution
and temporal trend tracking. We evaluate our approach on temporal QA benchmarks
and a novel end-to-end setting where the KG is dynamically updated from raw
documents. Our method outperforms both prompting-based and KG-enhanced
baselines, effectively narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on
dynamic question answering. Notably, an 8B-parameter model using our approach
matches the performance of a 671B model prompted seven months later. These
results highlight the importance of combining temporal reasoning with KG
evolution for robust and up-to-date LLM performance. Our code is publicly

### [135] [Solar Forecasting with Causality: A Graph-Transformer Approach to Spatiotemporal Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15481)
*Yanan Niu,Demetri Psaltis,Christophe Moser,Luisa Lambertini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarCAST是一种基于因果关系的模型，仅使用历史GHI数据进行太阳能预测，无需复杂硬件，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高太阳能预测的准确性，仅依赖公开传感器数据，避免依赖专业硬件和复杂预处理。

Method: 通过嵌入模块处理同步变量，时空图神经网络捕捉潜在同步因素，门控Transformer建模时滞影响。

Result: 在多种地理条件下优于现有方法，误差比顶级商业预测器Solcast降低25.9%。

Conclusion: SolarCAST提供了一种轻量、实用且通用的局部太阳能预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate solar forecasting underpins effective renewable energy management.
We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from
site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or
satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To
deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three
classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural
components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station
identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors
(e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural
network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across
stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It
outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse
geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top
commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and
generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.

*Robson L. F. Cordeiro,Meng-Chieh Lee,Christos Faloutsos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FRAUDGUESS是一种检测和解释金融欺诈交易的方法，通过微聚类和可视化技术发现新类型欺诈并提供证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖已知欺诈标签，难以发现新类型欺诈，且缺乏对检测结果的解释。

Method: 设计特征空间中的微聚类检测新欺诈，利用可视化和热图提供证据，并开发交互式仪表板深入分析。

Result: 在真实百万级金融数据集中发现三种新行为，其中两种被专家确认为欺诈或可疑，捕获数百笔欺诈交易。

Conclusion: FRAUDGUESS有效发现新欺诈类型并提供解释，已在真实场景中验证并考虑部署。

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how
much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find
fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known
types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new
types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we
also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion
('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals:
(a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a
carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses
visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard
for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for
deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present
the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale
financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious
by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would
otherwise go un-noticed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WIEN-INR是一种基于小波的隐式神经表示方法，通过多尺度架构和专用内核网络解决现有INR方法在紧凑网络规模下难以保留高频信息和细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示（INR）方法在紧凑网络规模下难以有效表示多尺度结构、高频信息和精细纹理，限制了其在科学数据中的应用。

Method: 提出WIEN-INR，采用小波启发的多尺度架构，在不同分辨率尺度上分布建模，并在最精细尺度使用专用内核网络恢复细节。

Result: 在多种科学数据集上，WIEN-INR实现了更高的重建保真度，同时保持紧凑的模型规模。

Conclusion: WIEN-INR扩展了INR在高保真科学数据编码中的应用，为需要高效保留细节的领域提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and
parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding
information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent
representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when
constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the
multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that
characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that
distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a
specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This
multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the
full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and
reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific
datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR
achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model
size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation
framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the
applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is
essential.

*Zahra Aref,Narayan B. Mandayam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EWA-VQ-ODT通过引入轻量级模块，改进了在线决策Transformer的性能，提升了样本效率和平均回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线决策Transformer缺乏对动作结果显式记忆，导致学习长期动作效果效率低下。

Method: 提出EWA-VQ-ODT模块，通过向量量化和认知模型（如EWA）维护动作吸引力账户，调整注意力机制。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，EWA-VQ-ODT在样本效率和平均回报上优于ODT，尤其在早期训练阶段。

Conclusion: EWA-VQ-ODT是一种高效、可解释且理论支持的改进方法，适用于在线决策Transformer。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential
decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement
learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value
function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL
as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and
lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation
through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable
alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on
bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use
standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.
This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.
Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we
propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online
Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains
per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.
Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact
vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated
online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate
attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no
change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control
benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT,
particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient,
interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that
bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯方法的策略梯度优化算法，用于解决具有一般损失函数和未知参数的MDP问题，并分析了其收敛性和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用问题中，MDP的参数未知且损失函数复杂，传统动态规划方法不适用，因此需要新的优化方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法估计参数，利用相干风险度量的对偶表示，提出策略梯度优化算法，并扩展到情景设置。

Result: 算法收敛速度为$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$，扩展算法在每情景中达到误差$O(\epsilon)$的迭代次数有界。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了复杂MDP问题，具有理论保证和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the
epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian
approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk
functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss.
Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability
principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by
approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy
gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent
risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then
show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of
$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations
and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our
algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the
extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to
achieve an error bound $O(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

*Jungjin Lee,Jaeuk Shin,Gihwan Kim,Joonho Han,Insoon Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoopCast是一个轻量高效的轨迹预测模型，利用Koopman算子理论实现非线性动态的线性表示，具有高精度、可解释性和低延迟部署的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态环境中轨迹预测的复杂性和非线性问题，同时保持模型的轻量化和高效性。

Method: 采用两阶段设计：先通过概率神经目标估计器预测长期目标，再用Koopman算子细化模块结合意图和历史数据进行线性预测。

Result: 在多个数据集（ETH/UCY、Waymo Open Motion Dataset、nuScenes）上验证了高预测精度、模式级可解释性和实际效率。

Conclusion: KoopCast在保持高效的同时，实现了高精度和可解释性，适用于复杂动态环境中的轨迹预测。

Abstract: We present KoopCast, a lightweight yet efficient model for trajectory
forecasting in general dynamic environments. Our approach leverages Koopman
operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by
lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a
two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts
plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman
operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a
nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go.
This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also
inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully
capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key
advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman
spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits
on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich
multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across
benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together
with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，对于此类通用问题，简单方法通常表现更好。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者和实践者提供了实用指南，强调简单方法的优势。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data often lie on or
near a low-dimensional manifold. Estimating the dimension of this manifold is
essential for leveraging its structure, yet existing work on dimension
estimation is fragmented and lacks systematic evaluation. This article provides
a comprehensive survey for both researchers and practitioners. We review
often-overlooked theoretical foundations and present eight representative
estimators. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how individual factors
such as noise, curvature, and sample size affect performance. We also compare
the estimators on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, introducing a
principled approach to dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Our results
offer practical guidance and suggest that, for a problem of this generality,
simpler methods often perform better.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAC的新方法，通过动态感知上下文建模解决多智能体强化学习中的非平稳性和相对泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全分散的多智能体强化学习中，智能体无法访问其他智能体的动作，导致值函数更新时的非平稳性和值函数估计时的相对泛化问题，影响合作策略学习。

Method: DAC将任务建模为上下文马尔可夫决策过程，通过动态感知上下文建模解决非平稳性和相对泛化问题，包括引入基于上下文的值函数和乐观边际值。

Result: 在多种合作任务（如矩阵游戏、捕食者与猎物、SMAC）上的实验表明，DAC优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: DAC通过动态感知上下文建模有效解决了多智能体强化学习中的非平稳性和相对泛化问题，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: This paper studies fully decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
learning, where each agent solely observes the states, its local actions, and
the shared rewards. The inability to access other agents' actions often leads
to non-stationarity during value function updates and relative
overgeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective
cooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both
issues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of
other agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the
task, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision
Process, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative
overgeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC
attributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches
between unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.
Then, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and
refers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based
value function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function
update. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived
to promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the
relative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various
cooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its
superior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性动力学通常使解析信念传播难以处理，且系统模型未知时需从数据中学习。

Method: 结合归一化流的密度估计能力和伯恩斯坦多项式的解析可处理性。

Result: 在高度非线性、非加性、非高斯噪声系统中优于现有数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为同时满足通用近似和解析信念传播的模型奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Predicting the distribution of future states in a stochastic system, known as
belief propagation, is fundamental to reasoning under uncertainty. However,
nonlinear dynamics often make analytical belief propagation intractable,
requiring approximate methods. When the system model is unknown and must be
learned from data, a key question arises: can we learn a model that (i)
universally approximates general nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii)
supports analytical belief propagation? This paper establishes the theoretical
foundations for a class of models that satisfy both properties. The proposed
approach combines the expressiveness of normalizing flows for density
estimation with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials. Empirical
results show the efficacy of our learned model over state-of-the-art
data-driven methods for belief propagation, especially for highly non-linear
systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.

Motivation: 现有方法假设损失函数强凸且噪声方差有限，但实际机器学习模型常不满足这些假设。

Result: 在重尾噪声下建立了收敛速率，实验验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的去中心化双层优化算法。

Abstract: Existing decentralized stochastic optimization methods assume the lower-level
loss function is strongly convex and the stochastic gradient noise has finite
variance. These strong assumptions typically are not satisfied in real-world
machine learning models. To address these limitations, we develop a novel
decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization algorithm for the nonconvex
bilevel optimization problem under heavy-tailed noises. Specifically, we
develop a normalized stochastic variance-reduced bilevel gradient descent
algorithm, which does not rely on any clipping operation. Moreover, we
establish its convergence rate by innovatively bounding interdependent gradient
sequences under heavy-tailed noises for nonconvex decentralized bilevel
optimization problems. As far as we know, this is the first decentralized
bilevel optimization algorithm with rigorous theoretical guarantees under
heavy-tailed noises. The extensive experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm in handling heavy-tailed noises.

TL;DR: PolyJuice是一种黑盒、图像无关的红队方法，通过分布偏移识别和利用合成图像检测器的失败模式，显著提高了欺骗检测器的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法需要白盒访问或昂贵优化，无法适用于专有检测器，PolyJuice旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过轻量级离线过程识别分布偏移方向，并利用该方向普遍引导图像生成，欺骗检测器。

Result: PolyJuice显著提高了欺骗检测器的成功率（高达84%），并可通过数据增强提升检测器性能（高达30%）。

Conclusion: PolyJuice是一种高效的黑盒红队方法，既能攻击检测器，又能增强其性能。

Abstract: Synthetic image detectors (SIDs) are a key defense against the risks posed by
the growing realism of images from text-to-image (T2I) models. Red teaming
improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes
via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i)
require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary
state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through
expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,
based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples
correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by
(i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline
process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting
this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's
failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at
deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also
show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower
resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation,
reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on
PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors
(up to 30%).

*Wei Lin,Qingyu Song,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文系统研究了零阶优化中的查询分配问题，比较了两种聚合方法（ZO-Avg和ZO-Align），发现单查询和多查询的优劣取决于聚合方法的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零阶优化中，多查询范式可以提高梯度估计精度，但查询分配问题尚未被充分探索。

Method: 分析了两种聚合方法：简单平均（ZO-Avg）和投影对齐（ZO-Align），并推导了它们的收敛速率。

Result: ZO-Avg在单查询时最优，而ZO-Align在多查询时表现更好。

Conclusion: 多查询问题的核心在于聚合方法的选择，而非查询规模。实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a powerful framework for problems
where explicit gradients are unavailable and have to be approximated using only
queries to function value. The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but
suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to
improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:
under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the
total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one
another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored
question.
  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze
two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new
Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate
minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the
dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,
non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,
we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always
query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the
contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,
resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work
clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an
intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated
entirely by the aggregation method used. These theoretical findings are also
consistently validated by extensive experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学问答中RLVR易受奖励黑客行为影响，如直接提供答案或使用非标准推理格式。

Method: 引入复合奖励函数，针对两种奖励黑客行为设置惩罚。

Result: 实验显示该方法减少了奖励黑客行为，推理格式更规范，准确性优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为减少奖励黑客行为、提升RLVR可靠性迈出了一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently shown that
large language models (LLMs) can develop their own reasoning without direct
supervision. However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for
question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the
reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i)
providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing
non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate
these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for
these behaviors. Our experiments show that extending RLVR with our proposed
reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and
good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward
reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR.

Method: 使用TCS模块将训练轨迹转化为结构化上下文，结合phi4和qwen2.5-coder两种小型LLM进行HPT。

Result: 在10次试验预算下，TCS框架的性能平均仅比GPT-4低约0.9个百分点。

Conclusion: 小型LLM结合TCS可以在HPT任务中高效替代大型模型，降低计算成本。

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML)
pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most
rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block
Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context
Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training
trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze
optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two
locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial
budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9
percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 研究为新类别发现的未来研究提供了起点，尤其适用于复杂现实数据集。

Abstract: Novel class discovery is essential for ML models to adapt to evolving
real-world data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to
robotics. However, these datasets contain complex and entangled factors of
variation, making a systematic study of class discovery difficult. As a result,
many fundamental questions are yet to be answered on why and when new class
discoveries are more likely to be successful. To address this, we propose a
simple controlled experimental framework using the dSprites dataset with
procedurally generated modifying factors. This allows us to investigate what
influences successful class discovery. In particular, we study the relationship
between the number of known/unknown classes and discovery performance, as well
as the impact of known class 'coverage' on discovering new classes. Our
empirical results indicate that the benefit of the number of known classes
reaches a saturation point beyond which discovery performance plateaus. The
pattern of diminishing return across different settings provides an insight for
cost-benefit analysis for practitioners and a starting point for more rigorous
future research of class discovery on complex real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Latent Zoning Network (LZN) 提出了一种统一的方法，通过共享高斯潜在空间解决生成建模、表示学习和分类任务，并在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成建模、表示学习和分类的解决方案是分离的，缺乏统一性。LZN旨在通过共享潜在空间简化机器学习流程并促进任务间的协同。

Method: LZN构建了一个共享的高斯潜在空间，为每种数据类型（如图像、文本、标签）配备编码器和解码器，任务通过组合这些模块实现。

Result: LZN在图像生成、表示学习和联合任务中表现优异，例如在CIFAR10上FID提升，并在ImageNet下游分类中超越MoCo和SimCLR。

Conclusion: LZN展示了统一方法的潜力，能够简化机器学习流程并在多个任务中实现高性能。

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available

*Jizhou Huang,Brendan Juba*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据需要复杂模型但牺牲可解释性，高风险应用（如医疗）需要准确且可解释的预测方法。

Method: 为每个查询学习稀疏线性分类器，研究其在半空间子群体中的PAC可学习性，提出参考类学习算法和稀疏线性表示列表学习器。

Result: 证明了稀疏线性分类器和均匀半空间子集的个性化预测上界为$O(\mathrm{opt}^{1/4})$，并在标准数据集上评估算法。

Conclusion: 个性化预测方案在保持可解释性的同时实现了竞争性性能，为高风险应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In machine learning applications, predictive models are trained to serve
future queries across the entire data distribution. Real-world data often
demands excessively complex models to achieve competitive performance, however,
sacrificing interpretability. Hence, the growing deployment of machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, motivates the search
for methods for accurate and explainable predictions. This work proposes a
Personalized Prediction scheme, where an easy-to-interpret predictor is learned
per query. In particular, we wish to produce a "sparse linear" classifier with
competitive performance specifically on some sub-population that includes the
query point. The goal of this work is to study the PAC-learnability of this
prediction model for sub-populations represented by "halfspaces" in a
label-agnostic setting. We first give a distribution-specific PAC-learning
algorithm for learning reference classes for personalized prediction. By
leveraging both the reference-class learning algorithm and a list learner of
sparse linear representations, we prove the first upper bound,
$O(\mathrm{opt}^{1/4} )$, for personalized prediction with sparse linear
classifiers and homogeneous halfspace subsets. We also evaluate our algorithms
on a variety of standard benchmark data sets.

Abstract: In the age of information overload, content management for online news
articles relies on efficient summarization to enhance accessibility and user
engagement. This article addresses the challenge of extractive text
summarization by employing advanced machine learning techniques to generate
concise and coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning. Using the
Cornell Newsroom dataset, comprising 1.3 million article-summary pairs, we
developed a pipeline leveraging BERT embeddings to transform textual data into
numerical representations. By framing the task as a binary classification
problem, we explored various models, including logistic regression,
feed-forward neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our
findings demonstrate that LSTM networks, with their ability to capture
sequential dependencies, outperform baseline methods like Lede-3 and simpler
models in F1 score and ROUGE-1 metrics. This study underscores the potential of
automated summarization in improving content management systems for online news
platforms, enabling more efficient content organization and enhanced user
experiences.

Conclusion: 进一步强调信息几何与贝叶斯的联系，鼓励更多交叉领域研究。

Abstract: We highlight a fundamental connection between information geometry and
variational Bayes (VB) and discuss its consequences for machine learning. Under
certain conditions, a VB solution always requires estimation or computation of
natural gradients. We show several consequences of this fact by using the
natural-gradient descent algorithm of Khan and Rue (2023) called the Bayesian
Learning Rule (BLR). These include (i) a simplification of Bayes' rule as
addition of natural gradients, (ii) a generalization of quadratic surrogates
used in gradient-based methods, and (iii) a large-scale implementation of VB
algorithms for large language models. Neither the connection nor its
consequences are new but we further emphasize the common origins of the two
fields of information geometry and Bayes with a hope to facilitate more work at
the intersection of the two fields.

Result: 在八项机器人任务中，SPReD表现优异，复杂任务中性能提升高达14倍，且对示范质量和数量鲁棒。

Conclusion: SPReD通过连续、不确定性比例调节的权重，有效减少训练梯度方差，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate
learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose
Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that
addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a
demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to
explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy
actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary
uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood
of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation
by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that
make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,
uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance
during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves
remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming
existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining
robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at

Method: 利用dropout作为梯度压缩机制，优化影响函数的计算过程。

Result: 显著降低了计算和内存开销，同时保留了数据影响的关键成分，适用于现代大规模模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模模型的影响函数计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing the impact the training data on machine learning models is crucial
for understanding the behavior of the model, enhancing the transparency, and
selecting training data. Influence function provides a theoretical framework
for quantifying the effect of training data points on model's performance given
a specific test data. However, the computational and memory costs of influence
function presents significant challenges, especially for large-scale models,
even when using approximation methods, since the gradients involved in
computation are as large as the model itself. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that leverages dropout as a gradient compression mechanism to
compute the influence function more efficiently. Our method significantly
reduces computational and memory overhead, not only during the influence
function computation but also in gradient compression process. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that our method
could preserves critical components of the data influence and enables its
application to modern large-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统正则化方案中的估计偏差问题。

Method: 扩展了LSTD框架中的策略评估，使用PMC惩罚正则化Bellman残差目标，并利用FRBS算法解决非单调包含问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有特征选择方法，尤其是在噪声特征多的场景中。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于高噪声环境下的特征选择。

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient batch algorithm for feature selection in
reinforcement learning (RL) with theoretical convergence guarantees. To
mitigate the estimation bias inherent in conventional regularization schemes,
the first contribution extends policy evaluation within the classical
least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) framework by formulating a
Bellman-residual objective regularized with the sparsity-inducing, nonconvex
projected minimax concave (PMC) penalty. Owing to the weak convexity of the PMC
penalty, this formulation can be interpreted as a special instance of a general
nonmonotone-inclusion problem. The second contribution establishes novel
convergence conditions for the forward-reflected-backward splitting (FRBS)
algorithm to solve this class of problems. Numerical experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, particularly in scenarios with many
noisy features.

Method: 提出H2T2在线学习框架，动态调整本地模型的置信度阈值，决定样本是本地分类还是卸载到远程模型。对于未校准模型，H2T2通过在线学习实现次线性遗憾。

Result: H2T2在真实数据集上表现优于朴素和单阈值策略，有时甚至超过离线最优解，且对分布偏移和模型不匹配具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: H2T2是一种无需训练、模型无关的在线学习策略，能有效优化层级推理系统的性能。

Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system
where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a
compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote
model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For
each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference.
Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the
remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between
classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical
inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning
framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's
confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model
and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We
present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is
calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce
H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it
achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and
learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world
datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI
policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also
demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to
mismatched classifiers.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分类任务中显著优于标准检索方法。

Conclusion: 结构感知和多样化的示例选择在标签稀缺的实际场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to new and data-scarce tasks using only a few
carefully selected task-specific examples presented in the prompt. However,
given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which
examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?
While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for
this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional
embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In
this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,
information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear
function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a
query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a
larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.
This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning
theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query
instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately
submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick
to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and
(ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in
the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements
over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks,
highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL
in real-world, label-scarce scenarios.

Motivation: 大型深度学习模型（如BERT和ResNet）在边缘设备上部署成本高，需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论（RMT）分析隐藏表示的谱特性，保留信息方向，逐层进行因果压缩和自蒸馏。

Result: 在GLUE、AG News和CIFAR-10上，RMT-KD实现了80%的参数减少，仅损失2%的准确率，推理速度提升2.8倍，功耗减半。

Conclusion: RMT-KD是一种数学基础扎实的网络蒸馏方法，适用于高效模型压缩。

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art
performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute
demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size.
Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only
informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden
representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with
self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and
CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy
loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.
These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network
distillation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）易产生幻觉和OOD错误，需要一种高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 通过流式协方差谱统计（如熵、特征值间隙和KL散度）输入轻量级循环分类器，实时跟踪表示结构的变化。

Result: EigenTrack能在表面错误出现前检测到幻觉和OOD漂移，且仅需单次前向传播。

Conclusion: EigenTrack是一种高效、可解释且保留时间上下文的白盒检测方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to
hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an
interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden
activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming
covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL
divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier,
EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal
hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and
grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling.
Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates
global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Accurate modelling of aircraft fuel-flow is crucial for both operational
planning and environmental impact assessment, yet standard parametric models
often neglect performance deterioration that occurs as aircraft age. This paper
investigates multiple approaches to integrate engine ageing effects into
fuel-flow prediction for the Airbus A320-214, using a comprehensive dataset of
approximately nineteen thousand Quick Access Recorder flights from nine
distinct airframes with varying years in service. We systematically evaluate
classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and
data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an
input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias. Results demonstrate that
while baseline models consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older
aircraft, the use of age-dependent correction factors and neural models
substantially reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. Nevertheless,
limitations arise from the small number of airframes and the lack of detailed
maintenance event records, which constrain the representativeness and
generalization of age-based corrections. This study emphasizes the importance
of accounting for the effects of ageing in parametric and machine learning
frameworks to improve the reliability of operational and environmental
assessments. The study also highlights the need for more diverse datasets that
can capture the complexity of real-world engine deterioration.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，覆盖更多交互流程，轨迹熵更高，用户意图更真实。

Conclusion: GUI-ReWalk是一个可扩展且数据高效的框架，推动了GUI代理研究和实际自动化应用。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and
vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in
digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by
the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data
collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations
or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and
meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a
reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and
diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase
that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions
into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and
purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation,
enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple
applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning
for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware,
adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B
on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including
Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results
demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction
flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These
findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for
advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.

Conclusion: iFSNet能有效适应数据分布变化，实现高精度在线电池寿命预测。

Abstract: Data-driven models accurately perform early battery prognosis to prevent
equipment failure and further safety hazards. Most existing machine learning
(ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining
post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there
is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying
distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a
great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the
current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of
time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we
propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified
version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep
forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the
input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and
calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model.
The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure
mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using
pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on
datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE
and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with
capacity regeneration spikes.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少LLM内部表示的偏见，适用于多类分类任务。

Abstract: To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is
important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes.
Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could
greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We
define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on
it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity,
equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We
formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest
ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it
when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families
(e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on
both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing
utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of
LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g.,
occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et
al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired
outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.

Conclusion: 该模型通过主动决策能力有效解决了传统启发式方法的局限性，为产能规划提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production
resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in
semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize
actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and
recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot
easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can
gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural
network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines,
trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a
heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse
relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive
decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient
scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions.
  Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and
preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest
tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle
time by about 1.8% each.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注Lookahead在训练数据上的收敛性，而对其泛化能力理解不足，且分析常受限于严格的假设条件。

Method: 利用平均模型稳定性，推导了凸和强凸问题的泛化边界，无需全局Lipschitz连续性假设。

Result: 在凸问题中，分析展示了关于批量大小的线性加速。

Conclusion: 研究为Lookahead优化器的泛化能力提供了更全面的理论支持。

Abstract: The Lookahead optimizer enhances deep learning models by employing a
dual-weight update mechanism, which has been shown to improve the performance
of underlying optimizers such as SGD. However, most theoretical studies focus
on its convergence on training data, leaving its generalization capabilities
less understood. Existing generalization analyses are often limited by
restrictive assumptions, such as requiring the loss function to be globally
Lipschitz continuous, and their bounds do not fully capture the relationship
between optimization and generalization. In this paper, we address these issues
by conducting a rigorous stability and generalization analysis of the Lookahead
optimizer with minibatch SGD. We leverage on-average model stability to derive
generalization bounds for both convex and strongly convex problems without the
restrictive Lipschitzness assumption. Our analysis demonstrates a linear
speedup with respect to the batch size in the convex setting.

TL;DR: MCTD-ME结合掩码扩散模型与树搜索，通过多专家和多令牌规划提升蛋白质设计的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长程依赖和大搜索空间上表现不佳，需要更高效的蛋白质设计方法。

Method: MCTD-ME整合掩码扩散模型与树搜索，利用多专家和生物物理保真度增强的扩散去噪进行多位置联合修订。

Result: 在CAMEO和PDB基准测试中，MCTD-ME在序列恢复和结构相似性上优于单专家和无引导基线。

Conclusion: MCTD-ME是一个模型无关的框架，适用于蛋白质工程和多目标分子生成。

Abstract: The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into
functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining
autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle
with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search
space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts,
which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token
planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME
uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine,
jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It
further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided
by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while
preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule
(PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse
folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and
unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity
(scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from
multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and
applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and
multi-objective molecular generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LSRE的实例生成方法，用于为MetaBBO生成多样化的训练问题实例，以提高泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MetaBBO研究通常使用CoCo-BBOB基准套件作为训练问题集，但其多样性有限，可能导致过拟合和泛化能力差。

Method: LSRE通过训练自编码器将高维问题特征映射到2维潜在空间，并在该空间进行均匀网格采样，再通过遗传编程搜索函数公式，生成多样化的问题集Diverse-BBO。

Result: 实验表明，Diverse-BBO在合成和现实场景中均优于现有训练集选择，且消融研究验证了LSRE设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: LSRE生成的多样化问题集能显著提升MetaBBO的泛化性能，并揭示了实例多样性与泛化能力的关系。

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization
algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage
generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based
algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which
automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem
instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs
is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the
MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited
in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further
results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance
generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse
training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.
LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space
leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.
By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with
minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a
diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the
effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe
their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.
Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to
existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only
demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal
interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

TL;DR: ThermalGuardian是一种针对温度变化环境下汽车深度学习框架的测试方法，解决了温度波动导致的GPU频率变化对框架质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车环境中极端温度变化会影响GPU性能，导致深度学习框架出现延迟、精度错误和同步问题，现有测试方法未考虑温度影响。

Method: 通过模型变异规则生成测试输入模型，基于牛顿冷却定律模拟GPU温度波动，并根据实时温度控制GPU频率。

Result: ThermalGuardian能够检测温度变化引起的框架质量问题，弥补现有测试方法的不足。

Conclusion: ThermalGuardian为温度变化环境下的汽车深度学习框架提供了有效的测试解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems,
supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate
model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive
deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT
in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud,
vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from
-40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally,
heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.
These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments
through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks
are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency
variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer
critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,
high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series
operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot
be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they
ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge
this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning
framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically,
ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules
targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature
fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based
on real-time GPU temperature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Muon优化器的理论性能与实际表现存在差距，标准变体在随机非凸设置下仅达到次优收敛速率。

Method: 构建并分析方差缩减变体Muon-VR2，证明其达到最优收敛速率。

Result: Muon-VR2在理论和实验中均表现出最优收敛性能，并在Polyak-Łojasiewicz条件下提供收敛保证。

Conclusion: Muon-VR2首次证明了Muon类优化器的最优性，为开发更高效的加速变体提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated remarkable empirical success in handling
matrix-structured parameters for training neural networks. However, a
significant gap persists between its practical performance and theoretical
understanding. Existing analyses indicate that the standard Muon variant
achieves only a suboptimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ in
stochastic non-convex settings, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. To
explore the theoretical limits of the Muon framework, we construct and analyze
a variance-reduced variant, termed Muon-VR2. We provide the first rigorous
proof that incorporating a variance-reduction mechanism enables Muon-VR2 to
attain an optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, thereby
matching the theoretical lower bound for this class of problems. Moreover, our
analysis establishes convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition. Extensive experiments on vision
(CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks corroborate our theoretical findings on
per-iteration convergence. Overall, this work provides the first proof of
optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the path toward developing
more practically efficient, accelerated variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测方法缺乏系统运营商所需的时间和空间分辨率，影响太阳能光伏系统的大规模并网。

Method: 利用图神经网络挖掘输入数据的模态间和模态内相关性，提高预测精度和分辨率。

Result: 在瑞士127个地点的一年数据集上，预测误差为6.1%，与商业数值天气预报服务相当。

Conclusion: SolarCrossFormer在实时操作中表现出鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可整合新数据，并能仅凭坐标预测无数据地点的辐照度。

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the
large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid.
However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution
required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a
novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines
satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological
stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the
inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy
and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any
location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours
ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real
life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the
model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input
data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of
one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield
a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The
results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather
prediction service.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统求解器处理大规模整数线性规划（ILP）效率低，现有LNS框架因生成有效邻域困难而受限。

Method: HyP-ASO结合定制公式（计算变量选择概率）和强化学习（预测邻域大小），优化邻域生成。

Result: 实验表明HyP-ASO显著优于现有LNS方法，且轻量、可扩展。

Conclusion: HyP-ASO是高效、可扩展的大规模ILP求解框架。

Abstract: Directly solving large-scale Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) using traditional
solvers is slow due to their NP-hard nature. While recent frameworks based on
Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their
performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently
effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a
hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a
customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages
feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable
in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the
neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly
outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional
experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited
for solving large-scale ILPs.

Result: 在心血管患者数据集上，聚类精度提升8-12%，通信减少70%，效率保留98.2%。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗数据提供了一种几何感知的联邦学习新标准，兼具理论严谨性和临床实用性。

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory
with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients
from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware
similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay
this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy
Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View
Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced
communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods.
Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for
collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data.
Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence,
adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new
standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced
math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: EvoBrain通过显式动态建模和时序-图分离策略，显著提升了癫痫检测的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Dynamic GNNs, which integrate temporal and spatial features in
Electroencephalography (EEG) data, have shown great potential in automating
seizure detection. However, fully capturing the underlying dynamics necessary
to represent brain states, such as seizure and non-seizure, remains a
non-trivial task and presents two fundamental challenges. First, most existing
dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to
reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.
Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures
and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in
inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first
theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.
Building on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection
model that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by
Laplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,
EvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes
and edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical
analysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and
time-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that
significantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the
dynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the
challenging early seizure prediction tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，适用于长尾分类任务，显著减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中神经网络无意记忆训练数据导致的隐私风险，提出一种更高效的联邦遗忘方法。

Method: 提出ToFU框架，通过变换组合限制实例特定信息，简化后续遗忘过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和MUFAC基准测试中表现优于现有方法，减少遗忘时间。

Conclusion: ToFU为联邦遗忘提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Neural networks unintentionally memorize training data, creating privacy
risks in federated learning (FL) systems, such as inference and reconstruction
attacks on sensitive data. To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy
regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable
participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global
model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to
efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue
that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems
inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a
learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework
that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce
memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how
transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information,
directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a
plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU
outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with
current methods, and reduces unlearning time.

Motivation: 扩散模型的高采样成本限制了其应用，现有方法独立处理每个查询，效率低下。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，结合共享采样方案和定制训练策略，以提升效率和保持质量。

Result: 实验显示SAGE降低25.5%采样成本，FID降低5.0%，CLIP提高5.4%，多样性提高160%。

Conclusion: SAGE在减少采样成本的同时提升了生成质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models manifest evident benefits across diverse domains, yet their
high sampling cost, requiring dozens of sequential model evaluations, remains a
major limitation. Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized
solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we
reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across
semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without
sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling
framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a
tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show
that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality
with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

Result: 实验表明，LLMs的改进直接提升了FWMs和FAs的性能；当前LLMs构建的FAs在简单环境中已能提供优秀策略；FWMs与强化学习代理的结合在复杂环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 基础模型（FMs）能有效提升强化学习的样本效率，FWMs和FAs在不同场景下均展现出潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning from scratch has shown impressive results in
solving sequential decision-making tasks with efficient simulators, real-world
applications with expensive interactions require more sample-efficient agents.
Foundation models (FMs) are natural candidates to improve sample efficiency as
they possess broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but it is yet unclear
how to effectively integrate them into the reinforcement learning framework. In
this paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising
strategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that
exploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents
with simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents
(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We
evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments
that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs).
Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better
FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent
policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs
and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings
with partial observability and stochastic elements.

advertising performance. Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding
(AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and
trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior
and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning
(RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter
a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation
quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address
this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel
method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to
AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to
assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its
generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance
trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key
techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better
representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for
better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for
better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our approach.

Motivation: 传统MCTS在符号回归中因赌博机策略和顺序符号构建受限，需改进搜索效率和全局优化能力。

Conclusion: 改进的MCTS框架在符号回归中具有竞争力和高效性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical
expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a
highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been
the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning
methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with
its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has
emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However,
its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often
limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for
symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key
innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying
globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under
polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping
actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to
promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape
the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and
efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these
improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression
methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box
datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto
frontier of accuracy versus model complexity. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受经济学和认知科学中的有限理性启发，研究反馈对齐中的系统性偏差问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联模型 $U \to H \to Y$，结合认知容量和总容量分析。

Result: 提出了容量耦合的对齐性能区间，表明标签增加无法突破性能界限，复杂目标需要更多容量。

Conclusion: 对齐问题应视为接口工程，需合理分配有限容量并管理任务复杂度。

Abstract: Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still
exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded
rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as
resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model
the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive
capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity
$\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment
Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved
on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is
controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes
bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical
observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under
these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity.
Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding
labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex
targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal
saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities,
consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views
alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity,
manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯物理信息神经网络（B-PINN）框架，用于概率性预测，解决了传统方法在不确定性和物理知识整合上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习（SciML）在预测应用中受限，主要因复杂物理方程整合和不确定性量化方法的缺乏。

Method: 将贝叶斯神经网络嵌入PINN架构，结合热扩散偏微分方程，研究不同先验分布对预测后验分布的影响。

Result: B-PINN在变压器老化案例中表现出更可靠的预测，准确量化了不确定性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: B-PINN为关键电力资产的维护决策提供了更可靠的预测支持。

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the
learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely
data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics
remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial
differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust
uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic
prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN
architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware
predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where
insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat
diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior
distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior
distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The
framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with
real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a
dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable
prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This
capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance
decision-making in critical power assets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model
is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasks, ranging from
positioning workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting
devices like USB connectors. While existing methods often rely on regression,
feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and
generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation.
The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by
iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final
stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates.
These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is
trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates
gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that
quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea
from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture
within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real
performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive
experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on
regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong
intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our
approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and
uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance
across a variety of real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 结论表明，影响函数不仅是解释工具，还能为接收器的高效适应提供基础。

Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based
wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver,
influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions,
enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that
loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and
first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error
rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in
single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective,
underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to
self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update
strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability
tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了AGF-TI优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGF-TI有效缓解了子簇问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view
semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address
this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus
on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label
propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples
sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking
the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster
Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification
performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view
semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an
adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the
distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all
similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure
from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor
learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the
computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm
combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the
formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental
results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Method: 采用M2Flow范式，自动分解和重组RL工作流，结合自适应通信、上下文切换和弹性流水线技术。

Result: 在推理和具身RL任务中，RLinf比现有系统快1.1x-2.13x。

Conclusion: RLinf通过系统灵活性优化显著提升了RL训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing
artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied
intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL
workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing
systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system
based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training
lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is
built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow
transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level,
easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and
recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's
adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic
pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling
policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both
reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in
end-to-end training throughput.

Motivation: 现有数字心理健康工具忽视日常挑战背后的复杂情感状态，如全球15亿人受睡前焦虑困扰，但现有方法缺乏个性化。

Method: EmoHeal使用微调XLM-RoBERTa模型检测27种细粒度情感，通过基于音乐治疗原则的知识图谱映射到音乐参数，并利用CLAMP3模型检索视听内容引导用户。

Result: 40人参与的研究显示显著情绪改善（M=4.12, p<0.001）和高感知情感识别准确率（M=4.05, p<0.001），且准确率与治疗效果强相关（r=0.72）。

Conclusion: 研究验证了理论驱动、情感感知的数字健康工具可行性，并为音乐治疗原则的规模化AI实现提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional
states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects
more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely
static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this
work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized,
three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions
from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical
parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS,
iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to
guide users from their current state toward a calmer one
("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant
supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement
(M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05,
p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic
outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings
establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools
and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy
principles.

Conclusion: IO-LVM能够捕捉成本函数的多样性，适用于不同代理或条件下的行为分析。

Abstract: Learning representations for solutions of constrained optimization problems
(COPs) with unknown cost functions is challenging, as models like (Variational)
Autoencoders struggle to enforce constraints when decoding structured outputs.
We propose an Inverse Optimization Latent Variable Model (IO-LVM) that learns a
latent space of COP cost functions from observed solutions and reconstructs
feasible outputs by solving a COP with a solver in the loop. Our approach
leverages estimated gradients of a Fenchel-Young loss through a
non-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space. Unlike
standard Inverse Optimization or Inverse Reinforcement Learning methods, which
typically recover a single or context-specific cost function, IO-LVM captures a
distribution over cost functions, enabling the identification of diverse
solution behaviors arising from different agents or conditions not available
during the training process. We validate our method on real-world datasets of
ship and taxi routes, as well as paths in synthetic graphs, demonstrating its
ability to reconstruct paths and cycles, predict their distributions, and yield
interpretable latent representations.

Result: 系统在极端主义检测中准确率为81%，恐怖主义为97%，优于基于n-gram的基线系统。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效检测和跟踪极端主义及恐怖主义倾向，并分析态度变化趋势。

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking
statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the
statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed
system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a
form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded
text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The
detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists,
extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of
features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The
data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect
intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and
terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was
higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on
n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal
analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a
person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were
able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could
be attributed to major events.

Conclusion: TSympNets填补了时间自适应辛积分器的理论空白，但适用范围有限，需进一步研究非可分离系统。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly i.e. not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [20] and
H\'enonNets [4] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets, which we
call TSympNets, was introduced in [20]. We adapt the architecture of TSympNets
and extend them to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. So far the approximation
qualities of TSympNets were unknown. We close this gap by providing a universal
approximation theorem for separable Hamiltonian systems and show that it is not
possible to extend it to non-separable Hamiltonian systems. To investigate
these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical
experiments. Furthermore we fix a mistake in a proof of a substantial theorem
[25, Theorem 2] for the approximation of symplectic maps in general, but
specifically for symplectic machine learning methods.

Motivation: 传统模型校准方法存在局限性，自动化发现本构模型成为一种有前景的替代方案。

Result: 所有九种算法组合在发现各向同性和各向异性材料时表现一致良好，生成了高精度的本构模型。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了可行的发现算法范围，超越了基于ℓ1的方法如LASSO。

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged
as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In
this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model
discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression
(LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection
criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct
algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the
trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost.
While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the
$\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for
$\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and
anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental
datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform
consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials,
yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range
of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

Result: 在HarmBench测试集上性能提升51%，验证集上困惑度变化微小。

Conclusion: SABER方法有效绕过LLM安全机制，性能显著提升且影响小。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful
instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models
typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to
ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.
However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to
produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,
we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the
middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box
jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which
connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a
residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the
best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces
only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation
set. The source code is publicly available at

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various
applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk
reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains
challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote
sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast
three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward
Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,
and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind
dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind
retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with
skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.
The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure
levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior
agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.
Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for
localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations
(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This
interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of
exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced
environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

Motivation: 解决现有分子生成模型无法保证生成可合成分子的问题，并提升分子优化性能。

Method: 引入链式反应（CoR）表示，结合监督训练和强化学习优化，实现逐步推理。

Result: 在可合成分子重建和优化任务中表现最佳，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReaSyn能够有效导航大规模可合成化学空间，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not
guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable
attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large
combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown
limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To
tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for
synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given
molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in
synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the
synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic
pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,
inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the
chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction
types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR
notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly
learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform
step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning
capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning
and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable
projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway
diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization
performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and
significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in
synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability
to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.

Motivation: 研究随机平滑在生成模型中的应用，解决其输出为序列而非标签的问题，以增强模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 将生成模型的输出连接到分类任务，利用RS技术，并通过理论分析关联样本数量与鲁棒性半径。

Result: 证明了RS在生成模型中的可行性，并提出了改进的缩放定律，减少了所需样本量。

Conclusion: 这些进展使得鲁棒性认证在先进视觉语言模型中既定义明确又计算可行。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is one of the prominent techniques to ensure the
correctness of machine learning models, where point-wise robustness
certificates can be derived analytically. While RS is well understood for
classification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their
outputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting
generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can
still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action
(e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content
moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster
answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the
oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates
the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further
derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and
accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3
orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid
even under weaker assumptions. Together, these advances make robustness
certification both well-defined and computationally feasible for
state-of-the-art VLMs, as validated against recent jailbreak-style adversarial
attacks.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维多视图数据时效率低下且隐私保护不足，需要一种更高效且隐私保护的方法。

Result: 能够高效处理高维多视图数据，并通过低秩张量近似显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持隐私的同时，提升了联邦学习在高维多视图数据中的效率和性能。

Abstract: We present a robust personalized federated learning framework that leverages
heat-kernel enhanced tensorized multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering with
advanced tensor decomposition techniques. Our approach integrates heat-kernel
coefficients adapted from quantum field theory with Tucker decomposition and
canonical polyadic decomposition (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to transform conventional
distance metrics and efficiently represent high-dimensional multi-view
structures. The framework employs matriculation and vectorization techniques to
facilitate the discovery of hidden structures and multilinear relationships via
N-way generalized tensors. The proposed method introduces a dual-level
optimization scheme: local heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering with tensor
decomposition operating on order-N input tensors, and federated aggregation of
tensor factors with privacy-preserving personalization mechanisms. The local
stage employs tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transformations and Tucker
decomposition to discover client-specific patterns in multi-view tensor data,
while the global aggregation process coordinates tensor factors (core tensors
and factor matrices) across clients through differential privacy-preserving
protocols. This tensorized approach enables efficient handling of
high-dimensional multi-view data with significant communication savings through
low-rank tensor approximations.

TL;DR: DiffusionNFT是一种新的在线强化学习范式，通过流匹配直接优化扩散模型，避免了传统方法的限制，显著提高了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线强化学习在扩散模型中的应用存在诸多限制，如求解器限制、前后向不一致性以及与无分类器引导的复杂集成。

Method: DiffusionNFT通过流匹配在正向过程中优化扩散模型，利用正负生成对比定义隐式策略改进方向，将强化信号融入监督学习目标。

Result: DiffusionNFT比FlowGRPO效率高25倍，无需无分类器引导，且在多个基准测试中显著提升了SD3.5-Medium的性能。

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT提供了一种高效且灵活的在线强化学习范式，适用于扩散模型的优化，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态CFG尺度无法适应不同提示的多样性需求，现有解决方案复杂且泛化能力差。

Method: 利用在线反馈（如CLIP、判别器和人类偏好模型）在反向扩散过程中动态选择最优CFG尺度。

Result: 在Imagen 3上，人类偏好胜率提升至53.8%，特定任务（如文本渲染）达55.5%。

Conclusion: 最优CFG尺度是动态且提示依赖的，该框架高效且泛化性强。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测冲击波传播对行星防御、国家安全和惯性聚变能源至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉孔隙塌陷等关键现象。

Method: MSTM将七个耦合场统一为一个自回归替代模型，基于高保真流体代码数据进行训练。

Result: MSTM比直接模拟快约1000倍，误差在4%（多孔材料）和10%（结构材料）以下，且能保持质量平均压力等积分量误差在5%以内。

Conclusion: MSTM为优化中尺度结构材料提供了实用框架，解决了以往难以处理的问题。

Abstract: The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected
materials is a decisive factor in planetary defense, national security, and the
race to achieve inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous
Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the
success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major
challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations.
We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that
unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy,
material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single
autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs
about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below
4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior
single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts
while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and
temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered
intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework
for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation,
inertial fusion energy, and national security.

Method: 将ACD建模为两玩家部分可观察马尔可夫决策问题，使用属性图表示观察结果，引入关系归纳偏置。

Result: 该方法在泛化性和零样本适应新网络方面显著优于现有技术，能有效防御未见过的网络。

Conclusion: 通过图表示和关系归纳偏置，该方法提升了网络防御的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for
automated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks
as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately,
these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering
them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In
this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable
Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs.
This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational
inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other
system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as
edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we
will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and
zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending
never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of
complex, and multi-agent environments.

Method: 基于梯度多样性的数据驱动方法，动态调整批大小，兼顾小批训练的泛化性能和大批计算的效率。

Result: 在合成数据集和CiFar-10等数据集上，DiveBatch比标准SGD和AdaBatch收敛速度快1.06-5.0倍，性能略有牺牲。

Conclusion: DiveBatch通过动态批大小调整，显著提升了训练效率，同时保持了泛化性能。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to accelerate the training of machine learning
models, a critical challenge since the training of large-scale deep neural
models can be computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
its variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to
traditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a
novel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts
the batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes
is more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often
converges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we
introduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling
DiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training
while improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient
diversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the
convergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and
CiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges
significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a
slight trade-off in performance.

Conclusion: 检索方法可以补充参数化学习，改善机器学习系统的数据效率，接近自然智能的泛化能力。

Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms
could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive
science to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure
to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the
task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this
perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling
to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive
science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these
issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval
mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better
across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential
components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of
within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information
across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible
contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning
systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval
methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

Result: 方法能可靠检测并成功反演真实后门触发器。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLM后门检测和反演中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: While effective backdoor detection and inversion schemes have been developed
for AIs used e.g. for images, there are challenges in "porting" these methods
to LLMs. First, the LLM input space is discrete, which precludes gradient-based
search over this space, central to many backdoor inversion methods. Second,
there are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative
trigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong
marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,
as such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not
exist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three
key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,
starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved
by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a
candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target
class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,
and with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we
demonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts
ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases.

Conclusion: 方法在仿真和实际实验中提高了接球成功率，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of in-flight object catching using a
quadruped robot with a basket. Our objective is to accurately predict the
impact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key
challenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under
unsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;
and the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when
trajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we
construct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing
a foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex
aerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),
consisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that
separates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and
generalization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the
impact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural
Acceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and
derives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that
directly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse
and complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on
both 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved
early-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments. The

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development and testing of GiAnt, an
affordable hexapod which is inspired by the efficient motions of ants. The
decision to model GiAnt after ants rather than other insects is rooted in ants'
natural adaptability to a variety of terrains. This bio-inspired approach gives
it a significant advantage in outdoor applications, offering terrain
flexibility along with efficient energy use. It features a lightweight
3D-printed and laser cut structure weighing 1.75 kg with dimensions of 310 mm x
200 mm x 120 mm. Its legs have been designed with a simple Single Degree of
Freedom (DOF) using a link and crank mechanism. It is great for conquering
challenging terrains such as grass, rocks, and steep surfaces. Unlike
traditional robots using four wheels for motion, its legged design gives
superior adaptability to uneven and rough surfaces. GiAnt's control system is
built on Arduino, allowing manual operation. An effective way of controlling
the legs of GiAnt was achieved by gait analysis. It can move up to 8 cm of
height easily with its advanced leg positioning system. Furthermore, equipped
with machine learning and image processing technology, it can identify 81
different objects in a live monitoring system. It represents a significant step
towards creating accessible hexapod robots for research, exploration, and
surveying, offering unique advantages in adaptability and control simplicity.

Abstract: Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due
to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core
capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2)
absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering
cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and
scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks
for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a
comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our
platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three
levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25
fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research
objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified
infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across
three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced
models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel
LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation
data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied

### [211] [Measurement and Potential Field-Based Patient Modeling for Model-Mediated Tele-ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15325)
*Ryan S. Yeung,David G. Black,Septimiu E. Salcudean*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的模型介导远程超声方法，通过更新内部势场模型提高力反馈精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程超声需要准确的力反馈以优化图像质量，但通信延迟使直接力反馈不实用。

Method: 生成患者表面点云模型，转换为静态体素化体积，结合测量力求解势场。

Result: 实验显示，加入测量力后力反馈误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了远程超声的力反馈透明度和准确性。

Abstract: Teleoperated ultrasound can improve diagnostic medical imaging access for
remote communities. Having accurate force feedback is important for enabling
sonographers to apply the appropriate probe contact force to optimize
ultrasound image quality. However, large time delays in communication make
direct force feedback impractical. Prior work investigated using point
cloud-based model-mediated teleoperation and internal potential field models to
estimate contact forces and torques. We expand on this by introducing a method
to update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured
positions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We
first generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this
to the sonographer in a compact data structure. This is converted to a static
voxelized volume where each voxel contains a potential field value. These
values determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap
between the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound
transducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that
combines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces. This was evaluated
on volunteer patients ($n=3$) by computing the accuracy of rendered forces.
Results showed the addition of measured forces to the model reduced the force
magnitude error by an average of 7.23 N and force vector angle error by an
average of 9.37$^{\circ}$ compared to using only Laplace's equation.

*Shaoting Peng,Katherine Driggs-Campbell,Roy Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种信任感知的贝叶斯说服框架（TA-EBP），用于改善自动驾驶车辆（AVs）与人类驾驶车辆（HVs）的交互，提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论模型在长期交互中影响力衰减且可能被视为操纵性，导致人类驾驶行为风险增加。因此，需要一种透明且非策略性的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TA-EBP框架，结合贝叶斯说服理论建模交通路口通信，引入信任参数，并推导最小信任水平和最优信号幅度的定理。

Result: 在混合交通仿真中验证，TA-EBP成功说服HVs更谨慎驾驶，消除碰撞并改善交通流。

Conclusion: TA-EBP为人类-机器人交互提供了一种透明且非策略性的影响框架，显著提升了安全性和效率。

Abstract: Safe and efficient interaction between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and
human-driven vehicles (HVs) is a critical challenge for future transportation
systems. While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often
suffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as
manipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier
human driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address
this challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion
(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply
Bayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a
transparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we
introduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for
the minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract
signals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful
action space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,
realized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a
mixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully
persuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving
traffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack
communication. Our work provides a transparent and non-strategic framework for
influence in human-robot interaction, enhancing both safety and efficiency.

TL;DR: Sym2Real是一个数据驱动的框架，通过符号回归和低仿真数据结合，实现高效数据利用的机器人控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决符号回归在机器人控制中直接应用时的噪声敏感性和模型退化问题，实现数据高效的适应性控制。

Method: 结合低仿真数据和实际世界残差学习，利用共享物理特性进行控制。

Result: 在四旋翼和赛车平台上验证，成功实现数据高效适应和仿真到现实的迁移。

Conclusion: Sym2Real框架在少量数据下实现了鲁棒控制，适用于多种现实条件。

Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled
way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner.
Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor
and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning.
Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to
real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct
application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to
unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often
shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we
strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world
residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar
platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six
out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across
five real-world conditions. More information and videos can be found at at

### [214] [Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation for Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15423)
*Christopher Oeltjen,Carson Sobolewski,Saleh Faghfoorian,Lorant Domokos,Giancarlo Vidal,Ivan Ruchkin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的在线滑移检测和轮胎-路面摩擦系数（TRFC）估计方法，仅依赖IMU和LiDAR测量及控制动作，无需复杂模型或训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRFC对车辆安全和性能至关重要，尤其在自动驾驶赛车中，但现有方法依赖不确定参数模型或大量训练数据。

Method: 通过比较指令与实际运动实时检测滑移事件，并在无滑移条件下直接从观测加速度估计TRFC。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同摩擦水平下均能准确检测滑移并估计摩擦系数，结果与真实测量值高度吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可部署且计算高效，适用于自动驾驶中的实时滑移监测和摩擦系数估计。

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential
for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous
racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC
cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation
methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or
require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight
approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies
solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special
dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip
events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions,
and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under
no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across
different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results
closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the
potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for
real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的隐式运动动力学运动重定向框架（IKMR），用于将大规模人类运动直接转换为机器人可执行的运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的运动重定向方法逐帧处理，缺乏可扩展性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: IKMR结合运动拓扑特征表示和双编码器-解码器架构，同时考虑运动学和动力学，通过模仿学习优化运动轨迹。

Result: 实验验证了IKMR在仿真和真实机器人上的有效性，能够实时生成物理可行的运动轨迹。

Conclusion: IKMR是一种高效且可扩展的运动重定向框架，适用于人形机器人控制。

Abstract: Human-to-humanoid imitation learning aims to learn a humanoid whole-body
controller from human motion. Motion retargeting is a crucial step in enabling
robots to acquire reference trajectories when exploring locomotion skills.
However, current methods focus on motion retargeting frame by frame, which
lacks scalability. Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into
robot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this
issue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel
efficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and
dynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation
and a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In
dynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting
network to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After
fine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically
feasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be
directly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We
conduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size
humanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的AI增强监督控制框架，用于多智能体机器人系统，结合了时间自动机监督、鲁棒连续控制和可解释预测器，并在航天器编队飞行和自主水下车辆中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为安全关键、资源受限的多智能体机器人系统提供一种可移植且可解释的控制方法。

Method: 结合时间自动机监督、鲁棒连续控制（Lyapunov控制器和滑模控制器）和可解释预测器，通过蒙特卡洛优化生成训练数据。

Result: 在航天器任务中，滑模控制器实现了亚毫米级对齐，跟踪误差降低21.7%，能耗降低81.4%；在AUV测试中，滑模控制器在随机电流下保持有界误差。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可移植性和可解释性，适用于安全关键的多智能体机器人系统。

Abstract: We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for
multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe,
auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based
controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with
boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an
explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected
performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the
training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs.
  We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation
flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different
environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share
uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion,
and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic
systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that
meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure
maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error.
In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment
with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to
Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV
tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results
highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for
safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.

Abstract: In emergency response missions, first responders must navigate cluttered
indoor environments where occlusions block direct line-of-sight, concealing
both life-threatening hazards and victims in need of rescue. We present STARC,
a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses
mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot
running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human
detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is
registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This
cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected
humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the
responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and
hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk.
Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust
pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the
potential of our system for fire-fighting, disaster relief, and other
safety-critical operations. Code and design will be open-sourced upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于近似贝叶斯推理的数据关联框架，用于处理多模态解决方案分布，避免在模糊场景中过早选择单一解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重复或对称数据场景下表现不佳，因为它们通常依赖最大似然估计或最大共识，导致在模糊情况下失败。

Method: 使用近似贝叶斯推理，将假设解表示为粒子，通过确定性或随机更新规则覆盖解分布的多模态。

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，该方法能正确估计点云或对象地图配准时的变换分布。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模糊数据关联问题，并能利用GPU并行优化提升性能。

Abstract: Global data association is an essential prerequisite for robot operation in
environments seen at different times or by different robots. Repetitive or
symmetric data creates significant challenges for existing methods, which
typically rely on maximum likelihood estimation or maximum consensus to produce
a single set of associations. However, in ambiguous scenarios, the distribution
of solutions to global data association problems is often highly multimodal,
and such single-solution approaches frequently fail. In this work, we introduce
a data association framework that leverages approximate Bayesian inference to
capture multiple solution modes to the data association problem, thereby
avoiding premature commitment to a single solution under ambiguity. Our
approach represents hypothetical solutions as particles that evolve according
to a deterministic or randomized update rule to cover the modes of the
underlying solution distribution. Furthermore, we show that our method can
incorporate optimization constraints imposed by the data association
formulation and directly benefit from GPU-parallelized optimization. Extensive
simulated and real-world experiments with highly ambiguous data show that our
method correctly estimates the distribution over transformations when
registering point clouds or object maps.

Motivation: 针对视觉障碍场景中的辅助导航需求，提出一种能够兼顾平滑性、可行性和实时性的轨迹优化方法。

Method: 分为两阶段：首先生成启发式轨迹采样簇（HTSC）并进行初步优化；第二阶段利用残差增强的Actor-Critic网络和LSTM时序建模自适应优化轨迹选择。

Result: LSTM-ResB-PPO模型收敛速度显著提升，训练稳定性增强，平均成本和方差分别降低30.3%和53.3%，自身和障碍风险降低77%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂辅助规划任务中表现出更高的鲁棒性、安全性和实时可行性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory
optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually
impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization
and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the
first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the
Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order
polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints
to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the
second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based
temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the
Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with
weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting
human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable
policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by
the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and
training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces
average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle
risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in
enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive
planning tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs can provide centimeter-level
accuracy for cloud-controlled vehicles while simultaneously serving multiple
vehicles, enhanc-ing safety and efficiency. While most existing studies rely on
repetitive scanning LiDARs, non-repetitive scanning LiDAR offers advantages
such as eliminating blind zones and being more cost-effective. However, its
application in roadside perception and localization remains limited. To address
this, we present a dataset for infrastructure-based vehicle localization, with
data collected from both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs, in
order to benchmark the performance of different LiDAR scanning patterns. The
dataset contains 5,445 frames of point clouds across eight vehicle trajectory
sequences, with diverse trajectory types. Our experiments establish base-lines
for infrastructure-based vehicle localization and compare the performance of
these methods using both non-repetitive and repetitive scanning LiDARs. This
work offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable LiDAR scanning
pattern for infrastruc-ture-based vehicle localization. Our dataset is a
signifi-cant contribution to the scientific community, supporting advancements
in infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization. The dataset and

Abstract: Efficiently delivering items to an ongoing surgery in a hospital operating

robots have successfully transported bulk items between rooms and floors.
However, automating item-level operating room logistics presents unique
challenges in perception, efficiency, and maintaining sterility. We propose the
Operating Room Bot (ORB), a robot framework to automate logistics tasks in
hospital operating rooms (OR). ORB leverages a robust, hierarchical behavior
tree (BT) architecture to integrate diverse functionalities of object

contributions of this paper include: (1) a modular software architecture
facilitating robust mobile manipulation through behavior trees; (2) a novel
real-time object recognition pipeline integrating YOLOv7, Segment Anything
Model 2 (SAM2), and Grounded DINO; (3) the adaptation of the cuRobo
parallelized trajectory optimization framework to real-time, collision-free

Conclusion: PRIMT通过多模态反馈和轨迹合成，显著提升了偏好强化学习的效率和效果。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering.
However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the
reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving
query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we
introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by
leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and
trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM
evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy,
integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and
vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and
comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory
generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the
trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory
augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary
loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6
manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance
over FM-based and scripted baselines.

Conclusion: 该研究为软执行器和微型机器人手术应用提供了重要突破。

Abstract: Miniature robots are untethered actuators, which have significant potential
to make existing minimally invasive surgery considerably safer and painless,
and enable unprecedented treatments because they are much smaller and dexterous
than existing surgical robots. Of the miniature robots, the magnetically
actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic
miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either
restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited
five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only
operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external
magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a
millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed
upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting
through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing
(biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions,
including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot
can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured
environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our
actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and
1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues
harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of
the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the
advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive
treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented
functionalities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LIVO系统依赖单摄像头，导致空间覆盖有限且鲁棒性下降。Omni-LIVO旨在通过多摄像头系统解决这一问题。

Method: 采用跨视图直接跟踪策略保持非重叠视图间的光度一致性，并扩展ESIKF以支持多视图更新和自适应协方差加权。

Conclusion: Omni-LIVO通过多摄像头系统有效提升了LiDAR-惯性-视觉里程计的性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Wide field-of-view (FoV) LiDAR sensors provide dense geometry across large
environments, but most existing LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry (LIVO) systems
rely on a single camera, leading to limited spatial coverage and degraded
robustness. We present Omni-LIVO, the first tightly coupled multi-camera LIVO
system that bridges the FoV mismatch between wide-angle LiDAR and conventional
cameras. Omni-LIVO introduces a Cross-View direct tracking strategy that
maintains photometric consistency across non-overlapping views, and extends the
Error-State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) with multi-view updates and adaptive
covariance weighting. The system is evaluated on public benchmarks and our
custom dataset, showing improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art
LIVO, LIO, and visual-inertial baselines. Code and dataset will be released
upon publication.

TL;DR: 通过新颖视角合成（NVS）技术，让机器人能够“想象”手部视角的观察，弥补硬件限制，提升视觉运动策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因硬件限制无法配备手部摄像头时，机器人视觉运动策略性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用微调的扩散模型（基于LoRA的ZeroNVS），根据相对姿态合成手部视角图像。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，合成的手部视角显著提升了策略性能，接近真实手部摄像头的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为硬件受限的机器人提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，展示了想象视觉推理的潜力。

Abstract: Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the
performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these,
egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise
control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand
cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and
cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception -
enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference
time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned
diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand
views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a
pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate
our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and
real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking
task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy
inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of
real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution
for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of
imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

TL;DR: GP3是一种利用多视角输入的3D几何感知机器人操作策略，通过空间编码器从RGB观测中推断密集空间特征，生成紧凑的3D场景表示，并结合语言指令生成连续动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作需要精确的3D场景几何理解，多视角观测是获取几何信息的直接方式。

Method: GP3使用空间编码器从RGB观测中提取密集空间特征，估计深度和相机参数，生成3D场景表示，并结合语言指令通过轻量级策略头生成动作。

Result: GP3在模拟基准测试中优于现有方法，并能有效迁移到无深度传感器或预建环境的真实机器人上，仅需少量微调。

Conclusion: GP3是一种实用、传感器无关的几何感知机器人操作解决方案。

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation relies on a precise understanding of 3D scene
geometry, and one of the most straightforward ways to acquire such geometry is
through multi-view observations. Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D
geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3
employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB
observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters,
leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for
manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and
translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to
real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring
only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical,
sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SMART是一种分层框架，结合优先级搜索和分布式优化，实现高效多车辆轨迹规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多车辆轨迹规划在密集环境中因碰撞约束增加而变得复杂，需高效探索可行行为并解决紧密交互。

Method: 上层通过强化学习优先级估计和大步长混合A*搜索探索交互模式，下层通过并行凸优化细化解决方案。

Result: 在50m x 50m地图上，SMART在1秒内支持25辆车成功率超90%；在100m x 100m地图上，支持50辆车成功率超95%。

Conclusion: SMART通过分层设计和车辆-基础设施协作，显著提升规划效率和安全性。

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes
increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of
collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and
resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale
coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and
Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based
search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible
multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes
using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A*
search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex
optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing
robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem
into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates
the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision
avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On
50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles,
while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves
above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles,
with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only
approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates
vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent
coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further
validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while
preserving cooperative behaviors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端环境中，机器人通信受限，需要可靠的人机交互辅助。

Method: 提出FlyKites框架，包含分布式探索、中继拓扑优化和人机在线执行三个组件。

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证了框架在复杂场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: FlyKites框架能有效支持有限通信下的多机器人协作探索与辅助。

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown
scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may
encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects,
temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent
human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however
can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is
severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks,
especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This
paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance
framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication.
It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration
and intermittent communication (called the "spread mode"), where the robots
collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet
and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay
topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles
(called the "relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided
with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the
robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator
adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments
are performed over numerous challenging scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法为物流应用提供了经济高效和快速的解决方案。

Abstract: Drones have recently emerged as a faster, safer, and cost-efficient way for
last-mile deliveries of parcels, particularly for urgent medical deliveries
highlighted during the pandemic. This paper addresses a new challenge of
multi-parcel delivery with a swarm of energy-aware drones, accounting for
time-sensitive customer requirements. Each drone plans an optimal multi-parcel
route within its battery-restricted flight range to minimize delivery delays
and reduce energy consumption. The problem is tackled by decomposing it into
three sub-problems: (1) optimizing depot locations and service areas using
K-means clustering; (2) determining the optimal flight range for drones through
reinforcement learning; and (3) planning and selecting multi-parcel delivery
routes via a new optimized plan selection approach. To integrate these
solutions and enhance long-term efficiency, we propose a novel algorithm
leveraging actor-critic-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
Extensive experimentation using realistic delivery datasets demonstrate an
exceptional performance of the proposed algorithm. We provide new insights into
economic efficiency (minimize energy consumption), rapid operations (reduce
delivery delays and overall execution time), and strategic guidance on depot
deployment for practical logistics applications.

Motivation: 视觉抓取系统受校准误差、传感器噪声和抓取位姿预测不准确限制，导致最终抓取阶段存在不可避免的接触不确定性。高带宽触觉反馈与触觉反应控制器结合可提升鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了一种纯触觉反馈的抓取调整算法，无需物体几何先验或精确初始抓取位姿，支持从粗糙初始配置和不确定接触点开始优化抓取。

Result: 在15自由度臂手系统（配备8自由度手和200Hz指尖触觉传感器）的仿真和实物实验中，验证了该触觉反应抓取框架显著提升抓取稳定性。

Conclusion: 触觉反应抓取框架能有效弥补视觉系统的不足，提升抓取鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-only grasping systems are fundamentally constrained by calibration
errors, sensor noise, and grasp pose prediction inaccuracies, leading to
unavoidable contact uncertainty in the final stage of grasping. High-bandwidth
tactile feedback, when paired with a well-designed tactile-reactive controller,
can significantly improve robustness in the presence of perception errors. This
paper contributes to controller design by proposing a purely tactile-feedback
grasp-adjustment algorithm. The proposed controller requires neither prior
knowledge of the object's geometry nor an accurate grasp pose, and is capable
of refining a grasp even when starting from a crude, imprecise initial
configuration and uncertain contact points. Through simulation studies and
real-world experiments on a 15-DoF arm-hand system (featuring an 8-DoF hand)
equipped with fingertip tactile sensors operating at 200 Hz, we demonstrate
that our tactile-reactive grasping framework effectively improves grasp
stability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的几何感知视觉编码器eVGGT，用于提升模仿学习中的3D推理能力，并在速度和模型大小上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB模仿学习方法缺乏显式3D推理能力，几何感知模型（如VGGT）虽能解决此问题，但计算成本高。

Method: 通过蒸馏VGGT提出eVGGT，在保持3D推理能力的同时显著降低计算成本。

Result: eVGGT在模仿学习中比标准视觉编码器成功率提升6.5%，且速度提升9倍、模型缩小5倍。

Conclusion: eVGGT为几何感知机器人研究提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional
vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning
capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as
VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are
promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the
integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation.
Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into
imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5%
improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and
bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.
Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high
computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To
address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder
distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than
VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained
models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware
robotics.

integrates a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon
trajectory optimization of the MPC. This formulation ensures convergence to
dynamically selected targets and guarantees collision avoidance, even under
general nonlinear dynamics and cluttered environments. The approach is
validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human
operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated
through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.

Abstract: Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action
(VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient
exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon
InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise
observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done
signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot
in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on
vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning
capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground
action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to
reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by
constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples.
With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and
action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous
real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline
demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that
accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct
real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to
about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating
human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample
efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和高保真模拟，框架能够高效处理动态和遮挡严重的任务，无需人工演示。

Abstract: Turning garments right-side out is a challenging manipulation task: it is
highly dynamic, entails rapid contact changes, and is subject to severe visual
occlusion. We introduce Right-Side-Out, a zero-shot sim-to-real framework that
effectively solves this challenge by exploiting task structures. We decompose
the task into Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an access opening, followed by
Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses a depth-inferred,
keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitive that sharply reduces the action space
while preserving robustness. Efficient data generation is enabled by our
custom-built, high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator
that models thin-shell deformation and provides robust and efficient contact
handling for batched rollouts. Built on the simulator, our fully automated
pipeline scales data generation by randomizing garment geometry, material
parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint
labels without any human annotations. With a single depth camera, policies
trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware, achieving up
to 81.3% success rate. By employing task decomposition and high fidelity
simulation, our framework enables tackling highly dynamic, severely occluded
tasks without laborious human demonstrations.

Motivation: 现有区块链预言机可能降低自主性或透明度，甚至重新引入信任问题，因此需要一种更去中心化、可靠的解决方案。

Method: 利用机器人集群的分散性、容错性和移动性，结合拜占庭容错协议和多利益相关方参与，实现高质量的社会共识。

Result: 实验证明，即使在大量机器人攻击的情况下，Swarm Oracle仍能达成共识，并通过基于代币的声誉系统实现自主恢复。

Conclusion: Swarm Oracle为区块链提供了一种安全、去中心化的真实世界数据验证方案，适用于长期运行。

Abstract: Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits
access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some
participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains,
but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the
need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous
robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer
communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart
contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in
decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can
flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote
locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates
robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party
biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the
secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a
Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different
stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality
than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using
both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain
environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks
orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system
based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults
and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在长尾、安全关键场景中表现有限，这些罕见场景导致大量事故。VLA模型有潜力但受限于数据质量和学习效率。

Method: CoReVLA通过两阶段（数据收集和行为优化）提升性能：先在开源数据集上微调，再在CAVE模拟平台收集接管数据，通过DPO优化模型。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CoReVLA的驾驶分数和成功率分别达到72.18和50%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoReVLA能持续提升性能，适用于长尾场景，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive
and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by
deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial
and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that
activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible
tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover,
despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the
progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future
actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of
safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture
that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling
humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using
natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also
present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art
components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision
agriculture scenario.

Abstract: Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may
shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a
characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically
perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same
impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly
non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be
easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering
other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated
participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious
task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer,
which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the
experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic
object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying
a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire
voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short
robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of
three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with
the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics.
We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot
interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest
that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social
dynamics to robots without testing them first.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with
arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments.
Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic
clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on
polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations
are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural
network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and
tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted
clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures
continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a
Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into
a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation
technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's
rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,
effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show
that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot
geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in
cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times
and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond
existing CBF-based methods.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人任务中，成功率显著高于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了长时任务中的鲁棒性和组合泛化能力。

Abstract: A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the
ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While
prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences
pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves
remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution
shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene
graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations,
thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea,
we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural
networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused"
scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner.
Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate
substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines,
highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in
long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂任务控制问题，并在仿真和硬件实验中验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Although humanoid and quadruped robots provide a wide range of capabilities,
current control methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, focus mainly on
single skills. This approach is inefficient for solving more complicated tasks
where high-level goals, physical robot limitations and desired motion style
might all need to be taken into account. A more effective approach is to first
train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through
imitation, while providing latent space control over skill execution. Then,
this policy can be used to efficiently solve downstream tasks. This method has
already been successful for controlling characters in computer graphics. In
this work, we apply the approach to humanoid and quadrupedal loco-manipulation
by imitating either simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog
motions. We extend the original formulation to handle constraints, ensuring
deployment safety, and use a diffusion discriminator for better imitation
quality. We verify our methods by performing loco-manipulation in simulation
for the H1 humanoid and Solo12 quadruped, as well as deploying policies on
Solo12 hardware. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Learning whole-body mobile manipulation via imitation is essential for
generalizing robotic skills to diverse environments and complex tasks. However,
this goal is hindered by significant challenges, particularly in effectively
processing complex observation, achieving robust generalization, and generating
coherent actions. To address these issues, we propose DSPv2, a novel policy
architecture. DSPv2 introduces an effective encoding scheme that aligns 3D
spatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features. This fusion enables the
policy to achieve broad generalization while retaining the fine-grained
perception necessary for precise control. Furthermore, we extend the Dense
Policy paradigm to the whole-body mobile manipulation domain, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating coherent and precise actions for the whole-body
robotic platform. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both task performance and generalization
ability. Project page is available at: https://selen-suyue.github.io/DSPv2Net/.

Conclusion: I-FailSense为开放世界中的机器人操作提供了鲁棒的失败检测能力，数据集和模型已公开。

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not
only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust
deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning
and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability
to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored
challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot
executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given
instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets
targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing
language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an
open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for
failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by
training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to
different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using
an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms
state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting
semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic
misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure
categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and
real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are
publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage:

Abstract: Unsteady aerodynamic effects can have a profound impact on aerial vehicle

acceleration, and a sampling-based policy optimization strategy capable of
leveraging the vortex particle model for predictive reasoning. We demonstrate,
through both simulation and hardware experiments, that by replanning with our
unsteady aerodynamics model, we can improve the performance of aggressive
post-stall maneuvers in the presence of unsteady environmental flow

Abstract: We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm
using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using
arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external
objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a
computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight
information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight
sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the
presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in
proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common
sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor
placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a
radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm
and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to
reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to
object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors
on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has
potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe
human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: 结合LLMs、VLMs和图推理的RE-GoT为RL中的奖励设计提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and
iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations,
reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step
tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts
(RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured
graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for
automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into
text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function
generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from
VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4
ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing
LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates
by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2,
RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse
manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and
even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining
LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and
effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.

Abstract: Fish-inspired aquatic robots are gaining increasing attention in research
communities due to their high swimming speeds and efficient propulsion enabled
by flexible bodies that generate undulatory motions. To support the design
optimizations and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and
computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is
indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish
swimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the
continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large
deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling
self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter
study explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on
swimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that
swimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat
frequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal
values. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and
inform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.

Abstract: We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic
Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by
natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main
limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require
manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent,
which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we
propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models
(VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable
indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language
retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian
optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a
motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC
through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating
that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor
scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results
highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from
open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.
