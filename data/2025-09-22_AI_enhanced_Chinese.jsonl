Our objective is to accurately predict the\nimpact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key\nchallenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under\nunsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;\nand the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when\ntrajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we\nconstruct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing\na foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex\naerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),\nconsisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that\nseparates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and\ngeneralization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the\nimpact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural\nAcceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and\nderives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that\ndirectly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse\nand complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on\nboth 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved\nearly-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments.

However,\ntheir static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands\n-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by\nprivacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,\nincluding retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often\ncomputationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or\ncontinuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:\nrethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in\ncapability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies\nknowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than\nencoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics\nto dedicated prompt tokens.

An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks", "comment": "24 pages, XAI 2025", "summary": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently\ndemonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of\ncomputer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in\nstandard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate\nthe landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image\nModeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention\nblock -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features\nobtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common\nfoundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing\napproaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through\nadditional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined\nwith distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods\ncan improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\nanalysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features\nhas yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically\nevaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and\nsegmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts.

In this paper, we\nintroduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by\nleveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and\ntrajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM\nevaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy,\nintegrating the complementary strengths of large language models and\nvision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and\ncomprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory\ngeneration, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the\ntrajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory\naugmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary\nloss to improve credit assignment.

In\npractice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in\nmulti-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.\nThese findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an\ndata-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method\nthus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image\ngeneration.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaskAttn-SDXL\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdbSDXL\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728SDXL\u7684UNet\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529blogits\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5316token\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "logit\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the\nfactual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through\ntest-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models\n(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act\nloop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating\ncross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without\naccess to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate\nreasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed\nprimarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent\nadversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense\nmechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on\nhallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,\nand (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied.

This work investigates the\nintegration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation.\nOur results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into\nimitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5%\nimprovement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and\nbi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.\nDespite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high\ncomputational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems.

Code and pretrained\nmodels will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware\nrobotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668eVGGT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u76843D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RGB\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f3D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VGGT\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998fVGGT\u63d0\u51faeVGGT\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u63013D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "eVGGT\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u53476.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53479\u500d\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u5c0f5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "eVGGT\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

While originally proposed for the language data,\nthey quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities\nwith various signal geometries.

The attempts to\nincorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based\non ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar\nproblems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in\nthis paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a\nmathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data.

Second, building upon SPQE, we propose\nInteraction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these\nShapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning\neither 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints.\nComprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models\nacross three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's\nscalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying\nsolely on isolated metrics.

Thus, we also present\nthe three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale\nfinancial dataset.

These rare\ncases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action\n(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,\nbut their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and\ninefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we\npropose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework\nthat improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage\nprocess of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly\nfine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to\nacquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is\ndeployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation\nplatform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.\nEach takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle\nreliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid\nreward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and\nclosed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can\naccurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the\nBench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a\nSuccess Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and\n15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies\ndemonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in\nsimilar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences.

In reinforcement\nlearning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value\nfunction approximation.

These attractions modulate\nattention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no\nchange to the backbone or training objective.

Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and\nemotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire\nunderstanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis\npredominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary\nnon-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional\nMultimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,\nwhich enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively\ncapture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,\nlow-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for\ncross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into\nsub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to\ncapture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an\nimage-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal\ninteraction at both local and global representations of image information.\nAdditionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale\nimage strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into\nsub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a\nmultimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as\nemotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent\nimprovements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness\nof our proposed method.

The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but\nsuffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to\nimproves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:\nunder a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the\ntotal number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one\nanother. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored\nquestion.\n  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze\ntwo aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new\nProjection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate\nminimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the\ndependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,\nnon-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,\nwe prove that using more than one query per iteration is always\nquery-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the\ncontrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,\nresulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach.

We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated\noptimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle\nand significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad\nrange of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nintegrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present\ngeneralization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the\nvalidity of our new evaluation protocols.

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified\nprinciple address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and\nfoster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.

We propose\nSmooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that\naddresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a\ndemonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to\nexplicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy\nactions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary\nuncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood\nof demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation\nby statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that\nmake binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,\nuncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance\nduring training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves\nremarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming\nexisting approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining\nrobustness to demonstration quality and quantity.

However,\ngiven the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which\nexamples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?\nWhile nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for\nthis purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional\nembedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In\nthis work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,\ninformation theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear\nfunction over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a\nquery-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a\nlarger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.\nThis formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning\ntheoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query\ninstance.

However, training\nlarge-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial\nmemory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,\nwhich can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we\npropose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a\nsubset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this\ndramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and\noptimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's\nlimited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three\nsystem-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters\nfor fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer\nupdates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize\nunnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive\nevaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly\nlowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds\ncomparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian\nSplatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the\nnumber of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,\nleading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)\nimprovement.", "AI": {"tldr": "GS-Scale\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0GPU\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0cGS-Scale\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "GS-Scale\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5378\u8f7d\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u53d1\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "GS-Scale\u5c06GPU\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e3.3-5.6\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534723-35%\u3002", "conclusion": "GS-Scale\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Most existing machine learning\n(ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining\npost-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there\nis a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying\ndistributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a\ngreat challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the\ncurrent instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of\ntime to acquire enough streaming data before retraining.

For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,\nroughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie\ngroups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which\ndescribe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales\ncan be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output\nfrom corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,\nstructurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional\npreferences.\n  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships\nbetween spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different\nvalues of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more\nefficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of\nmulti-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating\nidealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological\nvision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u534f\u53d8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u54cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u7fa4\u548c\u674e\u7fa4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ea7\u8054\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u54cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u751f\u7269\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u751f\u7269\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

At the data level, existing SCD\ndatasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and\na lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully\nsupport practical applications. At the methodological level, most current\napproaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a\npost-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further\nimprovements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new\nbenchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the\ndataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more\nfine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved\nroads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)\nmethod, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and\nbackgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model\ncollaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its\nability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal\ninteraction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction\nFusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the\nmodel's detection performance.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called\nChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and\nKeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these\nissues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism\nthat systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage\nprocess to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal\ninformation. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective\ntemporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection\ndetection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.\nSecondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm\nwith a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models\nto leverage both frame content and temporal relationships.

To optimize SAM2 for\nrange-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to\nthe encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies\ninherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to\nthe geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism\nin the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial\npatterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images.

There have been considerable\nattempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large\ncombinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown\nlimited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To\ntackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for\nsynthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given\nmolecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in\nsynthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the\nsynthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic\npathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,\ninspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the\nchain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction\ntypes, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR\nnotation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly\nlearn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform\nstep-by-step reasoning.

Despite significant advancements in VSR\nover recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world\nvisual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and\npose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local\nIntegrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon\ntwo key insights: (i) learning an initial \\textit{coarse} alignment between\nvisual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content\nfacilitates the subsequent learning of \\textit{precise} visual-to-speech\nmappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain\nlocal regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues\nfor lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path\nfeature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features\nwithin a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the\nmodel learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding\nacoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a\ncoarse yet semantically robust foundation.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and\nits variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to\ntraditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a\nnovel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts\nthe batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes\nis more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often\nconverges in fewer epochs and generalizes better.

While existing methods\naddress training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination\nmodels, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model\nsubsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified\nmodality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical\nself-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges\nrepresentation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,\nfeature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the\nhybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the\nintrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for\nmissing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant\ncontrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among\nincomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight\nreverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual\nsemantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid\nconsistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality\ncombinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and\nwhistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under\ndiverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

This work\npresents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to\nexploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.\nOur approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)\nevaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on\n48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance\ncomputations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to\nconventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold\nmatches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5\ngray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical\nlogarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees\nsuitable for real-time applications.
