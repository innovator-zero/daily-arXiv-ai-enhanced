We propose a new method where we\ndisaggregate the simulator and RL (both training and experience buffers) onto\nseparate GPUs. On a node with four GPUs, we have the simulator running on three\nof them, and PPO running on the fourth.

By leveraging concurrent process calculi\n(namely, Communicating Sequential Processes), we introduce a methodology that\ncan automatically identify possible causes of faulty meta-states and correct\nsuch designs such that meta-states are consistently stable, even in the\npresence of timing variability due to substrate changes. We evaluate this\napproach on a robotic swarm with a clearly identified fault, realized in both\nsimulation and reality. Results support the research hypothesis, showing that\nthe swarm reaches an illegal meta-state before the correction is applied, but\nbehaves consistently correctly after the correction. Our techniques are\ntransferable across different design methodologies, contributing to the toolbox\nof formal methods for roboticists."}

Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing\nOptimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a\nHierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for\npoint-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these\ndistortions, we propose GeoScores.

At its core is Dual-Group Direct\nPreference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises\ncaptioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption\npairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates\nrole-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different\nfunctional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances\nretrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate\nfine-grained captions for retrieval.

To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a\nsemi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a\nGaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework,\nmedical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames\nembedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This\nrepresentation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface\nreconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more\nefficient training than traditional neural implicit methods. Its explicit\nGS-based representation enhances noise robustness, allows flexible editing, and\nsupports precise modeling of complex anatomical structures with fewer\nartifacts.

Volume electron microscopy (EM) offers the resolution required to\ncapture synaptic architecture, but automated detection remains difficult due to\nsparse annotations, morphological variability, and cross-dataset domain shifts.\nTo address this, we make three key contributions. First, we curate a diverse EM\nbenchmark spanning four datasets across two invertebrate species: adult and\nlarval Drosophila melanogaster, and Megaphragma viggianii (micro-WASP). Second,\nwe propose SimpSyn, a single-stage Residual U-Net trained to predict\ndual-channel spherical masks around pre- and post-synaptic sites, designed to\nprioritize training and inference speeds and annotation efficiency over\narchitectural complexity. Third, we benchmark SimpSyn against Buhmann et al.'s\nSynful [1], a state-of-the-art multi-task model that jointly infers synaptic\npairs. Despite its simplicity, SimpSyn consistently outperforms Synful in\nF1-score across all volumes for synaptic site detection. While generalization\nacross datasets remains limited, SimpSyn achieves competitive performance when\ntrained on the combined cohort. Finally, ablations reveal that simple\npost-processing strategies - such as local peak detection and distance-based\nfiltering - yield strong performance without complex test-time heuristics.\nTaken together, our results suggest that lightweight models, when aligned with\ntask structure, offer a practical and scalable solution for synapse detection\nin large-scale connectomic pipelines."}

While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents.

Thyroid ultrasound\nimages are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple\ncomplex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density.

In real-world\nenvironments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact\ncoordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and\ninefficient.
