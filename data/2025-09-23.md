### [1] [Evaluation of Ensemble Learning Techniques for handwritten OCR Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16221)
*Martin Preiß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble Learning结合OCR用于历史病历数字化，提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史病历数字化需要高准确性，尤其在医学领域。Ensemble Learning可能提升OCR的准确性。

Method: 研究Ensemble Learning与OCR结合的方法。

Result: 发现Ensemble Learning能提高OCR准确性，且训练数据规模不影响结果。

Conclusion: Ensemble Learning为病历数字化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: For the bachelor project 2021 of Professor Lippert's research group,
handwritten entries of historical patient records needed to be digitized using
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods. Since the data will be used in the
future, a high degree of accuracy is naturally required. Especially in the
medical field this has even more importance. Ensemble Learning is a method that
combines several machine learning models and is claimed to be able to achieve
an increased accuracy for existing methods. For this reason, Ensemble Learning
in combination with OCR is investigated in this work in order to create added
value for the digitization of the patient records. It was possible to discover
that ensemble learning can lead to an increased accuracy for OCR, which methods
were able to achieve this and that the size of the training data set did not
play a role here.

### [2] [Agentic Reasoning for Robust Vision Systems via Increased Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16343)
*Chung-En,Yu,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视觉推理代理（VRA），通过“思考-批判-行动”循环提升视觉推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为高风险领域（如遥感、医疗诊断）开发可信赖的智能视觉系统，需在不增加训练成本的情况下实现广泛鲁棒性。

Method: VRA框架利用现成的视觉语言模型和纯视觉系统，通过“思考-批判-行动”循环进行推理。

Result: 在挑战性视觉推理基准测试中，VRA实现了高达40%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 未来工作将优化查询路由和早期停止机制，以减少推理开销，同时保持视觉任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy intelligent vision systems for high-stakes domains,
\emph{e.g.}, remote sensing and medical diagnosis, demands broad robustness
without costly retraining. We propose \textbf{Visual Reasoning Agent (VRA)}, a
training-free, agentic reasoning framework that wraps off-the-shelf
vision-language models \emph{and} pure vision systems in a
\emph{Think--Critique--Act} loop. While VRA incurs significant additional
test-time computation, it achieves up to 40\% absolute accuracy gains on
challenging visual reasoning benchmarks. Future work will optimize query
routing and early stopping to reduce inference overhead while preserving
reliability in vision tasks.

### [3] [From Canopy to Ground via ForestGen3D: Learning Cross-Domain Generation of 3D Forest Structure from Aerial-to-Terrestrial LiDAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16346)
*Juan Castorena,E. Louise Loudermilk,Scott Pokswinski,Rodman Linn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForestGen3D是一种生成模型，通过稀疏的航空LiDAR数据生成高保真的3D森林结构，填补了地面LiDAR数据的缺失，适用于生态建模和野火模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确测量3D植被结构对预测生态过程和干扰影响至关重要，但传统方法成本高且难以实施。

Method: 基于条件去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs），利用航空和地面LiDAR数据训练，生成TLS级别的3D点云。

Result: 在树、地块和景观尺度上验证，生成的3D结构与真实数据在几何和生物物理指标上高度一致。

Conclusion: ForestGen3D为ALS-only环境下的生态建模和野火模拟提供了可扩展的工具。

Abstract: The 3D structure of living and non-living components in ecosystems plays a
critical role in determining ecological processes and feedbacks from both
natural and human-driven disturbances. Anticipating the effects of wildfire,
drought, disease, or atmospheric deposition depends on accurate
characterization of 3D vegetation structure, yet widespread measurement remains
prohibitively expensive and often infeasible. We introduce ForestGen3D, a novel
generative modeling framework that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D forest
structure using only aerial LiDAR (ALS) inputs. ForestGen3D is based on
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) trained on
co-registered ALS/TLS (terrestrial LiDAR) data. The model learns to generate
TLS-like 3D point clouds conditioned on sparse ALS observations, effectively
reconstructing occluded sub-canopy detail at scale. To ensure ecological
plausibility, we introduce a geometric containment prior based on the convex
hull of ALS observations and provide theoretical and empirical guarantees that
generated structures remain spatially consistent. We evaluate ForestGen3D at
tree, plot, and landscape scales using real-world data from mixed conifer
ecosystems, and show that it produces high-fidelity reconstructions that
closely match TLS references in terms of geometric similarity and biophysical
metrics, such as tree height, DBH, crown diameter and crown volume.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the containment property can serve as a
practical proxy for generation quality in settings where TLS ground truth is
unavailable. Our results position ForestGen3D as a scalable tool for ecological
modeling, wildfire simulation, and structural fuel characterization in ALS-only
environments.

### [4] [Introducing Resizable Region Packing Problem in Image Generation, with a Heuristic Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16363)
*Hrishikesh Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图像数据生成问题（RARP），并设计了一种启发式算法解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像数据生成方法存在优化问题，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种贪心算法，用于在图像画布上任意位置打包任意形状和大小的区域。

Result: 算法成功生成了大规模合成异常检测数据集，并通过视觉检查验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: RARP问题在图像科学社区中具有潜在价值，尤其是在生成模型和合成数据生成日益流行的背景下。

Abstract: The problem of image data generation in computer vision has traditionally
been a harder problem to solve, than discriminative problems. Such data
generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at
meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular
approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based.
Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these
classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful
manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation
of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem,
Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide
detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a
novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs
arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an
image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region
pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The
algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a
large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of
bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection
of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the
effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep
learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect
that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific
community.

### [5] [Accurate Thyroid Cancer Classification using a Novel Binary Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform Descriptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16382)
*Saurabh Saini,Kapil Ahuja,Marc C. Steinbach,Thomas Wick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的甲状腺癌分类CAD系统，结合LDCT和ILBP特征提取方法，在公开数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲状腺超声图像分类因复杂解剖结构和噪声挑战大，需改进特征提取方法以提高准确性。

Method: 提出BPD-LDCT描述符（结合LDCT和ILBP），并使用非线性SVM进行分类。

Result: 在TDID和AUITD数据集上，良性/恶性分类准确率接近100%和97%，恶性亚分类准确率接近100%和99%。

Conclusion: BPD-LDCT描述符在甲状腺癌分类中表现卓越，验证了多描述符结合的有效性。

Abstract: In this study, we develop a new CAD system for accurate thyroid cancer
classification with emphasis on feature extraction. Prior studies have shown
that thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images
into different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer
classification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
is the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound
images are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple
complex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence,
we second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local
DCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context.
Another disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering
of ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third
conjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the
textural features and propose the integration of another popular texture
capturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is
known to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary
Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification
is carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on
the only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD.
The evaluation is conducted in two stages. In Stage I, thyroid nodules are
categorized as benign or malignant. In Stage II, the malignant cases are
further sub-classified into TI-RADS (4) and TI-RADS (5). For Stage I
classification, our proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance of
nearly 100% on TDID and 97% on AUITD. In Stage II classification, the proposed
model again attains excellent classification of close to 100% on TDID and 99%
on AUITD.

### [6] [StereoAdapter: Adapting Stereo Depth Estimation to Underwater Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16415)
*Zhengri Wu,Yiran Wang,Yu Wen,Zeyu Zhang,Biao Wu,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoAdapter是一种参数高效的自监督框架，结合了LoRA适应的单目基础编码器和循环立体细化模块，用于水下立体深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下立体深度估计中适应大型视觉基础编码器和融合单目先验与立体对应关系的挑战。

Method: 采用动态LoRA适应和合成数据集预训练，结合单目编码器与立体细化模块。

Result: 在模拟和真实基准测试中分别提升了6.11%和5.12%，并在真实机器人部署中表现稳健。

Conclusion: StereoAdapter在性能和效率上优于现有方法，适用于水下机器人任务。

Abstract: Underwater stereo depth estimation provides accurate 3D geometry for robotics
tasks such as navigation, inspection, and mapping, offering metric depth from
low-cost passive cameras while avoiding the scale ambiguity of monocular
methods. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (i)
parameter-efficiently adapting large vision foundation encoders to the
underwater domain without extensive labeled data, and (ii) tightly fusing
globally coherent but scale-ambiguous monocular priors with locally metric yet
photometrically fragile stereo correspondences. To address these challenges, we
propose StereoAdapter, a parameter-efficient self-supervised framework that
integrates a LoRA-adapted monocular foundation encoder with a recurrent stereo
refinement module. We further introduce dynamic LoRA adaptation for efficient
rank selection and pre-training on the synthetic UW-StereoDepth-40K dataset to
enhance robustness under diverse underwater conditions. Comprehensive
evaluations on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show improvements of
6.11% on TartanAir and 5.12% on SQUID compared to state-of-the-art methods,
while real-world deployment with the BlueROV2 robot further demonstrates the
consistent robustness of our approach. Code:

### [7] [AHA -- Predicting What Matters Next: Online Highlight Detection Without Looking Ahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16421)
*Aiden Chang,Celso De Melo,Stephanie M. Lukin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aha是一种自回归高光检测框架，用于实时视频流理解，无需访问未来帧，通过动态SinkCache机制实现恒定内存使用，并在标准基准测试中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法通常假设可以访问完整视频，不适合实时或流式场景，因此需要一种支持逐步推理的实时决策方法。

Method: Aha利用多模态视觉语言模型和轻量级解耦头，结合动态SinkCache机制，实现无限长度流的恒定内存使用。

Result: Aha在TVSum和Mr.Hisum基准测试中分别比现有方法提升5.9%和8.3%的mAP。

Conclusion: Aha展示了在机器人任务中作为实时推理模块的潜力，支持下游规划和长期理解。

Abstract: Real-time understanding of continuous video streams is essential for
intelligent agents operating in high-stakes environments, including autonomous
vehicles, surveillance drones, and disaster response robots. Yet, most existing
video understanding and highlight detection methods assume access to the entire
video during inference, making them unsuitable for online or streaming
scenarios. In particular, current models optimize for offline summarization,
failing to support step-by-step reasoning needed for real-time decision-making.
We introduce Aha, an autoregressive highlight detection framework that predicts
the relevance of each video frame against a task described in natural language.
Without accessing future video frames, Aha utilizes a multimodal
vision-language model and lightweight, decoupled heads trained on a large,
curated dataset of human-centric video labels. To enable scalability, we
introduce the Dynamic SinkCache mechanism that achieves constant memory usage
across infinite-length streams without degrading performance on standard
benchmarks. This encourages the hidden representation to capture high-level
task objectives, enabling effective frame-level rankings for informativeness,
relevance, and uncertainty with respect to the natural language task. Aha
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on highlight detection benchmarks,
surpassing even prior offline, full-context approaches and video-language
models by +5.9% on TVSum and +8.3% on Mr.Hisum in mAP (mean Average Precision).
We explore Aha's potential for real-world robotics applications given a
task-oriented natural language input and a continuous, robot-centric video.
Both experiments demonstrate Aha's potential effectiveness as a real-time
reasoning module for downstream planning and long-horizon understanding.

### [8] [3D Gaussian Flats: Hybrid 2D/3D Photometric Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16423)
*Maria Taktasheva,Lily Goli,Alessandro Fiorini,Zhen,Li,Daniel Rebain,Andrea Tagliasacchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合2D/3D高斯表示方法，优化平面和无约束区域的建模，提升室内场景重建的视觉质量和几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平坦、无纹理表面重建时效果不佳，导致不均匀和半透明结果，而表面重建方法又牺牲了视觉质量。

Method: 采用混合2D/3D高斯表示，动态检测和优化平面区域，结合端到端训练。

Result: 在ScanNet++和ScanNetv2上实现最先进的深度估计，并能高质量提取网格。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了室内场景重建的视觉和几何质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in radiance fields and novel view synthesis enable creation
of realistic digital twins from photographs. However, current methods struggle
with flat, texture-less surfaces, creating uneven and semi-transparent
reconstructions, due to an ill-conditioned photometric reconstruction
objective. Surface reconstruction methods solve this issue but sacrifice visual
quality. We propose a novel hybrid 2D/3D representation that jointly optimizes
constrained planar (2D) Gaussians for modeling flat surfaces and freeform (3D)
Gaussians for the rest of the scene. Our end-to-end approach dynamically
detects and refines planar regions, improving both visual fidelity and
geometric accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation on ScanNet++
and ScanNetv2, and excels at mesh extraction without overfitting to a specific
camera model, showing its effectiveness in producing high-quality
reconstruction of indoor scenes.

*Itzik Waizman,Yakov Gusakov,Itay Benou,Tammy Riklin Raviv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer和CNN的新型白质纤维束追踪方法，结合轨迹上下文和扩散MRI数据，提高了神经通路映射的精度和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统白质纤维束追踪方法在交叉、合并和扇形配置等复杂情况下的噪声和模糊性问题。

Method: 利用Transformer建模白质纤维束的序列特性，结合CNN提取局部微结构特征，预测纤维方向。

Result: 在Tractometer工具包上评估，性能优于传统方法，并在TractoInferno数据集上展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合Transformer和CNN，显著提升了白质纤维束追踪的精度和完整性。

Abstract: White matter tractography is an advanced neuroimaging technique that
reconstructs the 3D white matter pathways of the brain from diffusion MRI data.
It can be framed as a pathfinding problem aiming to infer neural fiber
trajectories from noisy and ambiguous measurements, facing challenges such as
crossing, merging, and fanning white-matter configurations. In this paper, we
propose a novel tractography method that leverages Transformers to model the
sequential nature of white matter streamlines, enabling the prediction of fiber
directions by integrating both the trajectory context and current diffusion MRI
measurements. To incorporate spatial information, we utilize CNNs that extract
microstructural features from local neighborhoods around each voxel. By
combining these complementary sources of information, our approach improves the
precision and completeness of neural pathway mapping compared to traditional
tractography models. We evaluate our method with the Tractometer toolkit,
achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches, and
present qualitative results on the TractoInferno dataset, demonstrating strong
generalization to real-world data.

### [10] [Improved mmFormer for Liver Fibrosis Staging via Missing-Modality Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16436)
*Zhejia Zhang,Junjie Wang,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于mmFormer的多模态MRI分类模型，通过自适应模块处理缺失模态，并在CARE 2025挑战中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床MRI中因设备或患者问题导致的模态缺失对模型性能的影响。

Method: 结合混合模态特定编码器和模态相关编码器，引入缺失模态补偿模块（零填充、模态可用性掩码和Delta函数），并采用交叉验证集成策略。

Result: 在肝硬化检测和显著纤维化检测任务中，准确率分别为66.67%和74.17%，AUC分别为71.73%和68.48%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理缺失模态问题，提升MRI分类性能。

Abstract: In real-world clinical settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently
suffers from missing modalities due to equipment variability or patient
cooperation issues, which can significantly affect model performance. To
address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on
the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary
combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid
modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to
extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we
integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding,
modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical
parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing
information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a
cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different
folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on
the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images
(CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based
on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI),
T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis
Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our
model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under
the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.

### [11] [AutoArabic: A Three-Stage Framework for Localizing Video-Text Retrieval Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16438)
*Mohamed Eltahir,Osamah Sarraj,Abdulrahman Alfrihidi,Taha Alshatiri,Mohammed Khurd,Mohammed Bremoo,Tanveer Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoArabic框架利用LLMs将非阿拉伯语视频文本基准翻译为现代标准阿拉伯语，显著减少人工修订需求，并引入高精度错误检测模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语在视频文本检索领域缺乏本地化评估指标，现有基准多为英语或多语言。

Method: 三阶段框架：翻译、错误检测（97%准确率）、生成阿拉伯语变体DiDeMo-AR。

Result: 生成40,144条流畅阿拉伯语描述，性能差距适中（3%），保留基准难度。

Conclusion: AutoArabic有效支持阿拉伯语本地化，代码开源，可推广至其他语言。

Abstract: Video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval are dominated by English benchmarks
(e.g. DiDeMo, MSR-VTT) and recent multilingual corpora (e.g. RUDDER), yet
Arabic remains underserved, lacking localized evaluation metrics. We introduce
a three-stage framework, AutoArabic, utilizing state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) to translate non-Arabic benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic,
reducing the manual revision required by nearly fourfold. The framework
incorporates an error detection module that automatically flags potential
translation errors with 97% accuracy. Applying the framework to DiDeMo, a video
retrieval benchmark produces DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with 40,144 fluent
Arabic descriptions. An analysis of the translation errors is provided and
organized into an insightful taxonomy to guide future Arabic localization
efforts. We train a CLIP-style baseline with identical hyperparameters on the
Arabic and English variants of the benchmark, finding a moderate performance
gap (about 3 percentage points at Recall@1), indicating that Arabic
localization preserves benchmark difficulty. We evaluate three post-editing
budgets (zero/ flagged-only/ full) and find that performance improves
monotonically with more post-editing, while the raw LLM output (zero-budget)
remains usable. To ensure reproducibility to other languages, we made the code
available at https://github.com/Tahaalshatiri/AutoArabic.

Method: 采用提示学习框架，将动作的文本描述嵌入预训练的VLM中，设计了多种文本描述编码策略。

Result: 在ETRI-Activity3D数据集上，仅使用RGB视频输入即达到95%以上准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 知识增强的提示学习能有效实现鲁棒的动作识别，且仅需少量监督。

Abstract: Accurate vision-based action recognition is crucial for developing autonomous
robots that can operate safely and reliably in complex, real-world
environments. In this work, we advance video-based recognition of indoor daily
actions for robotic perception by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs)
enriched with domain-specific knowledge. We adapt a prompt-learning framework
in which class-level textual descriptions of each action are embedded as
learnable prompts into a frozen pre-trained VLM backbone. Several strategies
for structuring and encoding these textual descriptions are designed and
evaluated. Experiments on the ETRI-Activity3D dataset demonstrate that our
method, using only RGB video inputs at test time, achieves over 95\% accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the
effectiveness of knowledge-augmented prompts in enabling robust action
recognition with minimal supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经系统疾病（如帕金森和阿尔茨海默病）会影响手写能力，但现有方法难以在不同数据集（时间序列和图像）上泛化。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在Draw Clock和Spiral任务中表现突出，PD检测的F1分数高达98。

Conclusion: 该模型能够泛化到不同形式的手写信号，显著提升了神经系统疾病中运动缺陷的检测能力。

Abstract: Handwriting is significantly affected by neurological disorders (ND) such as
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior works have
analyzed handwriting tasks using feature-based approaches or computer-vision
techniques, but these methods have struggled to generalize across multiple
datasets, particularly between temporal features represented as time-series and
images. We propose a framework that leverages both time-series and images of
handwriting through a joint classifier, based on a ResNet50 pretrained on
ImageNet-1k. Binary classification experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performances on existing time-series and image datasets, with significant
improvement on specific drawing and writing tasks from the NeuroLogical Signals
(NLS) dataset. In particular, the proposed model demonstrates improved
performance on Draw Clock and Spiral tasks. Additionally, cross-dataset and
multi-dataset experiments were consistently able to achieve high F1 scores, up
to 98 for PD detection, highlighting the potential of the proposed model to
generalize over different forms of handwriting signals, and enhance the
detection of motor deficits in ND.

*Qinyu Chen,Jiawen Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeVLM利用人眼注视信号减少视觉令牌冗余，提升视觉语言模型效率，同时保持任务相关细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉令牌剪枝时存在计算和内存开销增加、准确性折衷以及提示与图像兴趣区域不对齐的问题。

Method: 提出GazeVLM，通过提取注视驱动的兴趣区域（ROIs）并结合低分辨率全局视图，减少冗余令牌。

Result: 在VOILA-COCO基准测试中，GazeVLM减少视觉令牌93.1%、总令牌59.6%和FLOPs 50%，同时保持更好的回答质量。

Conclusion: 人眼注视信号为视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了一种简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver impressive performance in understanding
visual content with language instructions. However, redundancy in vision tokens
results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs, which hinders
real-time use on edge consumer devices such as AR/VR devices. Existing
efficiency methods commonly prune visual tokens using learned saliency, sparse
attention schedules, or controller policies, but they often require
architectural modification or access to intermediate activations. These
pipelines add inference-time modules that increase compute and memory and often
lead to an accuracy trade-off. Moreover, they also suffer from misalignment
between the prompts and the region of interest in the images. Without human
guidance, the model may focus on the wrong regions and miss small,
high-frequency details when prompts or scenes change. In this paper, we propose
GazeVLM, a training-free framework that uses the human eye gaze as a natural
supervisory signal to allocate computation where it matters. By extracting
gaze-driven regions of interest (ROIs) and optionally combining them with a
low-resolution global view, GazeVLM mimics fovea-periphery perception to cut
redundant visual tokens while preserving task-relevant details. We evaluate the
visual question answering tasks on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B on the VOILA-COCO benchmark
with human gaze. Quality of the answer is assessed by GPT-4o pairwise judging
and a weighted score over coverage, accuracy, details, and fluency. Efficiency
is measured by token counts and FLOPs. GazeVLM reduces visual tokens by up to
93.1%, total tokens by up to 59.6%, and FLOPs by 50%, while keeping better
answer quality relative to full-resolution baselines. Our results show that
aligning model computation with human gaze offers a simple, plug-and-play path
toward efficient VLM inference on consumer devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跌倒检测方案在可靠性、用户依从性和实用性方面存在不足，需要非穿戴式、被动、隐私保护且实时的解决方案。

Method: 使用BiConvLSTM模型，结合空间、时间、特征、自注意力和通用注意力机制，通过系统实验探索模型架构。

Result: 在TSF数据集上ROC-AUC达到99.7%，在TF-66新基准上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有普适性和实用性，为热成像跌倒检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using
wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges
in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that
stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer
non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems
that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall
detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory
(BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general
attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of
model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent
modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among
them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of
$99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly
emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the
generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards
for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable,
high-performance solutions.

*Xujia Zhang,Brendan Crowe,Christoffer Heckman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的框架Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion，用于完成、扩展和生成3D语义场景，适用于室内外场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常解耦这些问题且领域特定，缺乏跨域兼容性。

Method: 采用双八叉树图潜在表示，分两阶段：结构扩散和潜在语义扩散，支持推理时修补或扩展。

Result: 展示了高质量结构、连贯语义和鲁棒的完成能力，支持零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 双八叉树图潜在空间的生成方法为机器人感知任务提供了实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: The completion, extension, and generation of 3D semantic scenes are an
interrelated set of capabilities that are useful for robotic navigation and
exploration. Existing approaches seek to decouple these problems and solve them
oneoff. Additionally, these approaches are often domain-specific, requiring
separate models for different data distributions, e.g. indoor vs. outdoor
scenes. To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we
develop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and
generation in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent
Semantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree
graph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient
occupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i)
structure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse
occupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic
embeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform
semantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time
latent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods
use partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for
retraining or finetuning. We demonstrate highquality structure, coherent
semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, as well as zero-shot
generalization to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. These results indicate that
completion-through-generation in a dual octree graph latent space is a
practical and scalable alternative to regression-based pipelines for real-world
robotic perception tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据存在几何失真，影响自动驾驶感知任务性能。

Method: 引入RLGF，结合潜在空间AD感知模型的奖励，优化视频扩散模型。

Result: 几何误差显著减少（VP误差降低21%，深度误差降低57%），3D物体检测mAP提升12.7%。

Conclusion: RLGF为自动驾驶开发提供几何可靠的合成视频生成方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet
current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism,
suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for
downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue,
demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using
synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement
Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion
models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception
models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing
Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a
Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for
point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these
distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes,
RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth
error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%,
narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play
solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for
AD development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表单字段检测问题，填补大规模数据集和开源模型的空白。

Method: 将表单字段检测视为目标检测问题，构建数据集并训练FFDNet模型。

Result: FFDNet模型在测试集上表现优异，训练成本低，且能检测多种字段类型。

Conclusion: CommonForms是首个大规模表单字段检测数据集，FFDNet是首个开源模型，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: This paper introduces CommonForms, a web-scale dataset for form field
detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection:
given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice
Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering
Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million
documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of
roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the
dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the
pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up
more than 25% of the dataset.
  In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors,
FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on
the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation
results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form
field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over
using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative
analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF
reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available
solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature
fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for
form field detection, as well as the first open source models. The dataset,
models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法在视频质量和推理效率之间存在权衡，需要多步采样，效率较低。

Method: 提出相邻帧对抗训练范式和多帧融合机制，提升视频质量并保持帧间一致性。

Result: 在多个VSR基准测试中，OS-DiffVSR的质量优于现有多步扩散方法。

Conclusion: OS-DiffVSR通过一步扩散实现了高质量视频超分辨率，解决了效率与质量的矛盾。

Abstract: Recently, latent diffusion models has demonstrated promising performance in
real-world video super-resolution (VSR) task, which can reconstruct
high-quality videos from distorted low-resolution input through multiple
diffusion steps. Compared to image super-resolution (ISR), VSR methods needs to
process each frame in a video, which poses challenges to its inference
efficiency. However, video quality and inference efficiency have always been a
trade-off for the diffusion-based VSR methods. In this work, we propose
One-Step Diffusion model for real-world Video Super-Resolution, namely
OS-DiffVSR. Specifically, we devise a novel adjacent frame adversarial training
paradigm, which can significantly improve the quality of synthetic videos.
Besides, we devise a multi-frame fusion mechanism to maintain inter-frame
temporal consistency and reduce the flicker in video. Extensive experiments on
several popular VSR benchmarks demonstrate that OS-DiffVSR can even achieve
better quality than existing diffusion-based VSR methods that require dozens of
sampling steps.

TL;DR: SlowFast-SCI是一种双速框架，结合了慢速预训练和快速自适应学习，显著提升了光谱压缩成像的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开方法缺乏快速适应新光学配置的能力，导致在训练未见过的光谱设置中表现不佳。

Method: 通过慢速学习预训练骨干网络，并通过快速学习嵌入轻量级自适应模块，实现自监督测试时适应。

Result: 参数和计算量减少70%，PSNR提升5.79 dB，适应速度提高4倍。

Conclusion: SlowFast-SCI为自适应的、可部署的成像系统提供了模块化解决方案，扩展了计算成像的应用范围。

Abstract: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that
builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures
specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive
imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with
many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new
optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution
cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This
depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we
introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any
deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train
or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a
compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight
adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised
at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the
best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven
deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction.
Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample
calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB
PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain
adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity
integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive,
field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/XuanLu11/SlowFast-SCI.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB)，一个专注于文化推理的多模态视觉语言模型基准测试，通过两阶段任务评估模型在文化丰富图像上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文化数据集缺乏文化推理能力且对许多文化代表性不足，SCB旨在填补这一空白，特别关注东南亚文化。

Method: SCB采用两阶段任务：1) 多选视觉问答选择正确视觉选项；2) 分割相关文化文物作为推理证据。视觉选项分为同国、异国或混合组。

Result: SCB包含1,065张图像、3,178个问题（1,093个唯一），覆盖7个东南亚国家的138种文化文物。评估显示模型在跨模态文化推理中存在复杂性和视觉推理与空间定位的差距。

Conclusion: SCB为文化推理领域的未来发展提供了关键基准，揭示了当前模型的不足，特别是在文化细微场景中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress in
various tasks that require a combined understanding of visual and textual
content, particularly in cultural understanding tasks, with the emergence of
new cultural datasets. However, these datasets frequently fall short of
providing cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this
paper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural
reasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich
images in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with
multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the
relevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the
first stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating
from the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group.
Notably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type.
Progression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is
chosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural
artifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose
diverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which
1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation
of various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural
reasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial
grounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial
benchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future
developments in the field of cultural reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出FG-Attn，一种细粒度稀疏注意力机制，用于长上下文扩散变换器，显著提升视频生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有块稀疏注意力机制未能充分利用注意力图的稀疏性，计算效率仍有提升空间。

Method: 通过Mx1切片跳过计算，开发异步聚集加载操作，仅加载相关键值向量。

Result: 在H100 GPU上，5秒480p视频平均加速1.55倍，720p视频平均加速1.41倍。

Conclusion: FG-Attn显著提升视频扩散模型的效率，为长序列生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic videos with diffusion transformers demands significant
computation, with attention layers the central bottleneck; even producing a
short clip requires running a transformer over a very long sequence of
embeddings, e.g., more than 30K embeddings for a 5-second video, incurring
significant latency. Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting
sparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works
typically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only
when all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and
M keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of
attention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and
leaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse
attention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages
sparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips
entire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1
slices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products
between a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed
sparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation
called asynchronous-gather load. This load operation gathers a sparse set of
relevant key-value vectors from memory and arranges them into packed tiles in
the GPU's shared memory. Only a sparse set of keys relevant to those queries
are loaded into shared memory when computing attention for a block of queries,
in contrast to loading full blocks of key tokens in block-sparse attention. Our
fine-grained sparse attention, applied to video diffusion models, achieves an
average 1.55X (up to 1.65X) speedup for 5 second, 480p videos, and an average
1.41X (up to 1.49X) for 5 second, 720p videos on a single H100 GPU.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实时性和适应性上存在不足，LBM旨在高效适应真实世界的视觉跟踪任务。

Result: 在TAP-Vid、RoboTAP等基准测试中验证了LBM的高效性，并在TAO、BFT、OVT-B等大规模开放世界对象跟踪基准中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: LBM在在线和实时视觉跟踪任务中表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world
pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations
into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through
collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution
of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to
estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates
lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops
lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage
rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared
with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online
and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking
tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such
as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of
large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B
further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考标注的参考无关视频字幕评估框架VC-Inspector，通过事实基础评估字幕质量，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注视频字幕成本高且不切实际，现有依赖参考标注的评估方法难以适应多样视频领域。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成伪字幕训练多模态模型Qwen2.5-VL作为评估器。

Result: 在VATEX-Eval数据集上优于现有方法，且能推广至图像字幕数据集。

Conclusion: VC-Inspector为视频字幕评估提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Video captions offer concise snapshots of actors, objects, and actions within
a video, serving as valuable assets for applications such as question answering
and event localization. However, acquiring human annotations for video captions
is costly or even impractical, especially when dealing with diverse video
domains. Existing models trained on supervised datasets face challenges in
evaluating performance across different domains due to the reliance on
reference-based evaluation protocols, which necessitate ground truth captions.
This assumption is unrealistic for evaluating videos in the wild. To address
these limitations, we propose a reference-free evaluation framework that does
not require ground truth captions, focusing on factual grounding to ensure
accurate assessment of caption quality. We introduce VC-Inspector, a novel
caption quality evaluator that is both reference-free and factually grounded.
Utilizing large language models, we generate pseudo captions of varying quality
based on supervised data, which are subsequently used to train a multimodal
model (i.e., Qwen2.5-VL) as the evaluator. Our approach demonstrates superior
alignment with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset, outperforming
existing methods. The performance also generalizes to image caption datasets,
Flickr8K-Expert and Flickr8K-CF, when viewing images as 1-frame videos.
Overall, VC-Inspector offers a scalable and generalizable solution for
evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, paving the way for more
effective and objective assessment methodologies in diverse video domains.

Conclusion: RFfusion通过高效采样和任务优化，显著提升了图像融合的效率和效果。

Abstract: Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming
to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images.
In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the
field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex
computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of
these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient
one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We
incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the
sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the
need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion
results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE)
architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded
within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address
the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE
objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage
training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and
integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images,
thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while
significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
inference speed and fusion quality. Code is available at

Result: 在大规模nuScenes基准测试中，ST-GS实现了最先进的性能，并显著优于现有高斯基方法。

Conclusion: ST-GS框架有效解决了空间和时间建模的不足，为3D占用预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is critical for comprehensive scene understanding in
vision-centric autonomous driving. Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D
semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead,
but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and
limited multi-frame temporal consistency. To overcome these issues, in this
paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework
to enhance both spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based
pipelines. Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation
strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial
interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a
geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical
context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase
that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but
also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing
Gaussian-based methods.

Conclusion: I2S适合实时、设备端认证，适用于安全关键系统。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Recognition (HOIR) and user identification play a
crucial role in advancing augmented reality (AR)-based personalized assistive
technologies. These systems are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes,
human-centric environments such as aircraft cockpits, aerospace maintenance,
and surgical procedures. This research introduces I2S (Interact2Sign), a multi
stage framework designed for unobtrusive user identification through human
object interaction recognition, leveraging 3D hand pose analysis in egocentric
videos. I2S utilizes handcrafted features extracted from 3D hand poses and per
forms sequential feature augmentation: first identifying the object class,
followed by HOI recognition, and ultimately, user identification. A
comprehensive feature extraction and description process was carried out for 3D
hand poses, organizing the extracted features into semantically meaningful
categories: Spatial, Frequency, Kinematic, Orientation, and a novel descriptor
introduced in this work, the Inter-Hand Spatial Envelope (IHSE). Extensive
ablation studies were conducted to determine the most effective combination of
features. The optimal configuration achieved an impressive average F1-score of
97.52% for user identification, evaluated on a bimanual object manipulation
dataset derived from the ARCTIC and H2O datasets. I2S demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a lightweight model size of
under 4 MB and a fast inference time of 0.1 seconds. These characteristics make
the proposed framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device authentication
in security-critical, AR-based systems.

Method: 提出DG-DPO学习策略，通过建模不同视频和字幕对的偏好来监督字幕生成，并引入角色嵌入的MLLM检索模型。

Result: 实验表明CaRe-DPO能有效利用辅助知识生成细粒度字幕，显著提升检索性能。

Conclusion: CaRe-DPO通过直接优化检索相关性的字幕生成，解决了现有方法的局限性，为细粒度文本-视频检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In text-video retrieval, auxiliary captions are often used to enhance video
understanding, bridging the gap between the modalities. While recent advances
in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot
caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and
indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for
fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are
typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are
not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative
distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption
generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct
Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises
captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption
pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates
role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different
functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances
retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate
fine-grained captions for retrieval. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有黑盒反事实生成框架忽视语义内容且依赖训练，无法提供人类可理解的解释。

Result: 通过CNN、ViT和LVLM分类器实验，展示了人类推理与神经网络行为之间的解释差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成人类水平的反事实解释，且无需训练，具有可解释性。

Abstract: Recent black-box counterfactual generation frameworks fail to take into
account the semantic content of the proposed edits, while relying heavily on
training to guide the generation process. We propose a novel, plug-and-play
black-box counterfactual generation framework, which suggests step-by-step
edits based on theoretical guarantees of optimal edits to produce human-level
counterfactual explanations with zero training. Our framework utilizes a
pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the
internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual
generation process. Throughout our experimentation, we showcase the explanatory
gap between human reasoning and neural model behavior by utilizing both
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Vision
Language Model (LVLM) classifiers, substantiated through a comprehensive human
evaluation.

TL;DR: DeepSSIM是一种自监督度量方法，用于量化生成模型中的记忆化问题，在脑MRI数据案例中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型可能记忆敏感训练数据，导致患者信息泄露风险，需要可扩展的方法检测记忆化。

Method: 提出DeepSSIM，通过自监督学习将图像投影到嵌入空间，并匹配图像空间的SSIM分数。

Result: 在脑MRI数据实验中，DeepSSIM的F1分数比现有最佳方法平均提高52.03%。

Conclusion: DeepSSIM能有效检测生成模型的记忆化问题，为医学影像数据安全提供新工具。

Abstract: Deep generative models have emerged as a transformative tool in medical
imaging, offering substantial potential for synthetic data generation. However,
recent empirical studies highlight a critical vulnerability: these models can
memorize sensitive training data, posing significant risks of unauthorized
patient information disclosure. Detecting memorization in generative models
remains particularly challenging, necessitating scalable methods capable of
identifying training data leakage across large sets of generated samples. In
this work, we propose DeepSSIM, a novel self-supervised metric for quantifying
memorization in generative models. DeepSSIM is trained to: i) project images
into a learned embedding space and ii) force the cosine similarity between
embeddings to match the ground-truth SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) scores
computed in the image space. To capture domain-specific anatomical features,
training incorporates structure-preserving augmentations, allowing DeepSSIM to
estimate similarity reliably without requiring precise spatial alignment. We
evaluate DeepSSIM in a case study involving synthetic brain MRI data generated
by a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) trained under memorization-prone conditions,
using 2,195 MRI scans from two publicly available datasets (IXI and CoRR).
Compared to state-of-the-art memorization metrics, DeepSSIM achieves superior
performance, improving F1 scores by an average of +52.03% over the best
existing method. Code and data of our approach are publicly available at the
following link: https://github.com/brAIn-science/DeepSSIM.

TL;DR: SQS是一种新型的基于查询的预训练方法，专为稀疏感知模型（SPMs）设计，通过自监督的溅射技术提升自动驾驶中的3D感知任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏感知模型（SPMs）通过查询驱动的方式避免了显式的密集BEV或体积构建，但需要进一步优化以提升性能。

Method: SQS引入了一个插件模块，通过预训练预测3D高斯表示，并利用自监督溅射技术从多视角图像和深度图中学习细粒度上下文特征。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中，SQS在占用预测和3D物体检测任务中显著优于现有方法（如占用预测提升1.3 mIoU，3D检测提升1.0 NDS）。

Conclusion: SQS通过预训练和微调的结合，显著提升了稀疏感知模型在自动驾驶任务中的性能。

Abstract: Sparse Perception Models (SPMs) adopt a query-driven paradigm that forgoes
explicit dense BEV or volumetric construction, enabling highly efficient
computation and accelerated inference. In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel
query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in
autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian
representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging
self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the
reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the
pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks
via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries
with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements
of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on
autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable
performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in
occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior
state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3
mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步混合深度伪造（如Face-Swapping、GAN和Diffusion方法组合）对现有检测模型构成新挑战，需研究其检测行为。

Method: 构建FakeChain基准，包含1、2、3步伪造，使用五种先进生成器，分析检测性能和频谱特性。

Result: 检测性能高度依赖最终伪造类型，F1分数下降高达58.83%，显示检测器依赖最后阶段伪影。

Conclusion: 需开发考虑伪造历史的检测模型，FakeChain基准对应对现实复杂伪造场景至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different
deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and
Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for
detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have
mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about
the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex
manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a
large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using
five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we
analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid
manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and
quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance
highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to
\textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly
demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative
manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need
for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences.
Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain,
reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios.

Method: 提出D2S框架，结合视觉和文本语义特征，通过特征对齐和熵分布对齐机制，利用预训练视觉-语言模型生成图像描述。

Result: 在IC9600数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在NR-IQA基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 多模态融合在复杂度相关任务中有效且高效。

Abstract: Accurately assessing image complexity (IC) is critical for computer vision,
yet most existing methods rely solely on visual features and often neglect
high-level semantic information, limiting their accuracy and generalization. We
introduce vision-text fusion for IC modeling. This approach integrates visual
and textual semantic features, increasing representational diversity. It also
reduces the complexity of the hypothesis space, which enhances both accuracy
and generalization in complexity assessment. We propose the D2S
(Describe-to-Score) framework, which generates image captions with a
pre-trained vision-language model. We propose the feature alignment and entropy
distribution alignment mechanisms, D2S guides semantic information to inform
complexity assessment while bridging the gap between vision and text
modalities. D2S utilizes multi-modal information during training but requires
only the vision branch during inference, thereby avoiding multi-modal
computational overhead and enabling efficient assessment. Experimental results
demonstrate that D2S outperforms existing methods on the IC9600 dataset and
maintains competitiveness on no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA)
benchmark, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal fusion in
complexity-related tasks. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 地理空间基础模型在预测城市温度方面表现出色，为传统方法的局限性提供了替代方案。

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data. However, predictive analytics
methods based on conventional machine learning models and limited data
infrastructure often provide inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved
areas. In this context, geospatial foundation models trained on unstructured
global data demonstrate strong generalization and require minimal fine-tuning,
offering an alternative for predictions where traditional approaches are
limited. This study fine-tunes a geospatial foundation model to predict urban
land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios and explores its
response to land cover changes using simulated vegetation strategies. The
fine-tuned model achieved pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74 {\deg}C and
aligned with ground truth patterns, demonstrating an extrapolation capacity up
to 3.62 {\deg}C.

Conclusion: Surgical-MambaLLM显著提升了手术场景的视觉问答性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery
(Surgical-VQLA) has gained significant attention for its potential to assist
medical students and junior doctors in understanding surgical scenes. Recently,
the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more
promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to
establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have
difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the
first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages
Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive
spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs'
understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal
Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective
multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally,
tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the
Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the
surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical
scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and
EndoVis18-VQLA datasets, significantly improving the performance of the
Surgical-VQLA task.

Abstract: Skeleton-based gait emotion recognition has received significant attention
due to its wide-ranging applications. However, existing methods primarily focus
on extracting spatial and local temporal motion information, failing to capture
long-range temporal representations. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{CGTGait}, a novel framework that collaboratively integrates graph
convolution and transformers to extract discriminative spatiotemporal features
for gait emotion recognition. Specifically, CGTGait consists of multiple CGT
blocks, where each block employs graph convolution to capture frame-level
spatial topology and the transformer to model global temporal dependencies.
Additionally, we introduce a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module to
effectively aggregate posture and motion spatiotemporal features, facilitating
the exchange of complementary information between the two streams. We evaluate
our method on two widely used datasets, Emotion-Gait and ELMD, demonstrating
that our CGTGait achieves state-of-the-art or at least competitive performance
while reducing computational complexity by approximately \textbf{82.2\%} (only
requiring 0.34G FLOPs) during testing. Code is available at

benchmark it on ScienceQA, which consists of questions across diverse
languages, subjects, and fields, demonstrating its adaptability and
effectiveness in a variety of educational contexts. Additionally, to further
demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on lowresource languages, we
developed HiSciVQA, a dataset comprising 2,245 high-quality, hand-annotated
Hindi multimodal Q&A pairs. This dataset addresses the critical need for
low-resource language Q&A datasets and serves as a foundation for testing
VCASFT. Additionally, we introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation scheme to

Conclusion: 该方法在动画质量和可控性上表现优异，且高效易用，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework
for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main
challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait,
accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal
consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity
preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion
with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion
signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and
reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both
expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully
preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports
controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including
real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based
frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable
animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address
this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term
animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless
acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality
results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we
introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse
portraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences. Extensive evaluations on
EmojiBench++ demonstrate that Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster achieves superior
performance in both animation quality and controllability. The code, training
dataset and benchmark will be found in https://follow-your-emoji.github.io/.

Conclusion: DA-Font通过双注意力机制和损失函数设计，有效提升了少样本字体生成的质量。

Abstract: Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts with a limited number of
glyph references. It can be used to significantly reduce the labor cost of
manual font design. However, due to the variety and complexity of font styles,
the results generated by existing methods often suffer from visible defects,
such as stroke errors, artifacts and blurriness. To address these issues, we
propose DA-Font, a novel framework which integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid
Module (DAHM). Specifically, we introduce two synergistic attention blocks: the
component attention block that leverages component information from content
images to guide the style transfer process, and the relation attention block
that further refines spatial relationships through interacting the content
feature with both original and stylized component-wise representations. These
two blocks collaborate to preserve accurate character shapes and stylistic
textures. Moreover, we also design a corner consistency loss and an elastic
mesh feature loss to better improve geometric alignment. Extensive experiments
show that our DA-Font outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across diverse
font styles and characters, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
structural integrity and local fidelity. The source code can be found at

Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型计算成本高和小模型性能不足的问题。

Method: 采用基于对等的策略，识别知识差距并针对性优化。

Result: 在多个VQA基准测试中显著提升小模型性能。

Conclusion: MPA有效缩小性能差距，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in various vision and language tasks, including visual question
answering (VQA). However, their high computational cost makes them impractical
for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In
contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer
from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In
this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework
designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and
effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge
distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a
strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge
disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only
these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA
benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires
specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart
interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results
demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all
benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational
efficiency. We make our code publicly available.

Result: 实验表明模型在所有场景中表现优异且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: AT-ReID任务和Uni-AT模型为全天候多场景检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In real applications, person re-identification (ReID) is expected to retrieve
the target person at any time, including both daytime and nighttime, ranging
from short-term to long-term. However, existing ReID tasks and datasets can not
meet this requirement, as they are constrained by available time and only
provide training and evaluation for specific scenarios. Therefore, we
investigate a new task called Anytime Person Re-identification (AT-ReID), which
aims to achieve effective retrieval in multiple scenarios based on variations
in time. To address the AT-ReID problem, we collect the first large-scale
dataset, AT-USTC, which contains 403k images of individuals wearing multiple
clothes captured by RGB and IR cameras. Our data collection spans 21 months,
and 270 volunteers were photographed on average 29.1 times across different
dates or scenes, 4-15 times more than current datasets, providing conditions
for follow-up investigations in AT-ReID. Further, to tackle the new challenge
of multi-scenario retrieval, we propose a unified model named Uni-AT, which
comprises a multi-scenario ReID (MS-ReID) framework for scenario-specific
features learning, a Mixture-of-Attribute-Experts (MoAE) module to alleviate
inter-scenario interference, and a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting (HDW)
strategy to ensure balanced training across all scenarios. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads to satisfactory results and exhibits
excellent generalization to all scenarios.

Conclusion: GF-Core和自监督预训练有效提升了点云分析性能，同时保持了架构简洁性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis has evolved with diverse network architectures, while
existing works predominantly focus on introducing novel structural designs.
However, conventional point-based architectures - processing raw points through
sequential sampling, grouping, and feature extraction layers - demonstrate
underutilized potential. We notice that substantial performance gains can be
unlocked through strategic module integration rather than structural
modifications. In this paper, we propose the Grouping-Feature Coordination
Module (GF-Core), a lightweight separable component that simultaneously
regulates both grouping layer and feature extraction layer to enable more
nuanced feature aggregation. Besides, we introduce a self-supervised
pretraining strategy specifically tailored for point-based inputs to enhance
model robustness in complex point cloud analysis scenarios. On ModelNet40
dataset, our method elevates baseline networks to 94.0% accuracy, matching
advanced frameworks' performance while preserving architectural simplicity. On
three variants of the ScanObjectNN dataset, we obtain improvements of 2.96%,

TL;DR: ADVEDM是一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的细粒度对抗攻击框架，通过修改关键对象的感知来影响代理决策，同时保留其他区域的语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法要么依赖不切实际的强假设，要么因破坏过多语义信息导致无效输出，无法真正威胁物理世界中的代理行为。

Method: 提出ADVEDM框架，设计两种变体ADVEDM-R和ADVEDM-A，分别移除或添加特定对象的语义。

Result: 实验表明ADVEDM在通用场景和EDM任务中均表现出精细控制和优异的攻击性能。

Conclusion: ADVEDM通过细粒度攻击有效影响VLM决策，对物理世界中的代理行为构成更大安全威胁。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning
capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in
embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent
research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their
vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong
assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical
for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter
stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a
misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system
prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting
in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To
this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which
modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the
semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts
with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and
affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat
in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework,
ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific
object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The
experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate
fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.

*Xin Chen,Jia He,Maozheng Li,Dongliang Xu,Tianyu Wang,Yixiao Chen,Zhixin Lin,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在道路拓扑理解中的能力，发现其在空间推理方面存在瓶颈，且性能与模型规模、推理标记长度和示例数量正相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但在自动驾驶中的应用仍有限，尤其是道路拓扑理解能力不足。

Method: 通过将多视角图像投影到统一的地面坐标系并融合为鸟瞰图（BEV）车道，设计了四个拓扑相关的诊断VQA任务。

Result: 前沿闭源模型（如GPT-4o）在某些任务中表现较好，但在时间性问题中表现不佳（如仅67.8%准确率）；开源VLMs表现更差。

Conclusion: 空间推理是当前VLMs的主要瓶颈，未来研究应关注模型规模、推理标记长度和示例数量。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning, yet their applications in autonomous driving remain
limited. In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key
requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention.
While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their
performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we
systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding.
Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane
coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these
BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which
together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through
extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g.,
GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some
temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in
vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source
VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that
spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also
find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size,
length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction
for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MedCutMix的多模态数据增强方法，用于解决医学视觉语言预训练中的数据隐私和标注成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言预训练（VLP）依赖图像-文本数据集，但医学领域存在隐私和高标注成本问题，现有数据增强方法多样性不足。

Method: MedCutMix通过在医学报告中进行诊断句子CutMix，并建立诊断句子与医学图像的跨模态注意力，指导图像模态的混合。

Result: 在四个放射学诊断数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MedCutMix是一种有效的医学VLP数据增强方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) is drawing increasing interest for its
ability to minimize manual annotation requirements while enhancing semantic
understanding in downstream tasks. However, its reliance on image-text datasets
poses challenges due to privacy concerns and the high cost of obtaining paired
annotations. Data augmentation emerges as a viable strategy to address this
issue, yet existing methods often fall short of capturing the subtle and
complex variations in medical data due to limited diversity. To this end, we
propose MedCutMix, a novel multi-modal disease-centric data augmentation
method. MedCutMix performs diagnostic sentence CutMix within medical reports
and establishes the cross-attention between the diagnostic sentence and medical
image to guide attentive manifold mix within the imaging modality. Our approach
surpasses previous methods across four downstream radiology diagnosis datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing performance and generalizability in
radiology VLP.

TL;DR: FitPro是一个开放世界的交互式零样本文本行人检索框架，通过增强语义理解和跨场景适应性解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放世界场景中的交互检索存在模型泛化能力不足和语义理解不充分的问题。

Method: FitPro包含三个创新组件：特征对比解码（FCD）、增量语义挖掘（ISM）和查询感知分层检索（QHR）。

Result: 在五个公共数据集和两种评估协议上的实验表明，FitPro显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FitPro为实际部署铺平了道路，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve specific target
pedestrians in visual scenes according to natural language descriptions.
Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings,
interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited
model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR
framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability.
FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD),
Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval
(QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate
high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images,
effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM
constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to
achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions,thereby improving
robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in
descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to
query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view
inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation
protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization
limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in
interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment. The code and
data will be released at https://github.com/

TL;DR: 论文研究了动作视频对象分割中的标签噪声问题，提出了两种噪声类型，并建立了首个相关基准ActiSeg-NL，同时提出了并行掩模头机制（PMHM）以应对掩模标注噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动作视频对象分割依赖于大规模标注和提示，但这些标注成本高、不一致且易受多模态噪声影响。目前这一问题尚未被探索。

Method: 引入两种标签噪声类型（文本提示噪声和掩模标注噪声），建立ActiSeg-NL基准，并采用六种标签噪声学习策略进行评估。

Result: 分析了噪声类型与失败模式的关联，提出了PMHM机制，并展示了不同学习策略的鲁棒性差异。

Conclusion: 论文为动作视频对象分割中的标签噪声问题提供了首个基准和解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence relies on accurately segmenting objects actively
involved in interactions. Action-based video object segmentation addresses this
by linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale
annotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal
noise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this
challenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying
action-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two
sources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun
substitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic
imprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce
two types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task.
Second, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a
label noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies
to this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual,
boundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking
noise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel
Mask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative
evaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary
leakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional
identity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals
that different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles,
governed by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced
performance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of
background precision. The established benchmark and source code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/mylwx/ActiSeg-NL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据增强虽然能提升模型泛化能力，但可能引入分布偏移和噪声，从而限制深度网络的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种新的类判别信息估计算法和信息保留方案，将数据增强方法分为三类并整合到框架中。

Result: 实验表明，IPF-RDA能显著提升多种数据增强方法和深度模型在多个数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: IPF-RDA简单有效，能够增强数据增强的鲁棒性并释放其潜力。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely utilized as an effective technique to enhance the
generalization performance of deep models. However, data augmentation may
inevitably introduce distribution shifts and noises, which significantly
constrain the potential and deteriorate the performance of deep networks. To
this end, we propose a novel information-preserving framework, namely IPF-RDA,
to enhance the robustness of data augmentations in this paper. IPF-RDA combines
the proposal of (i) a new class-discriminative information estimation algorithm
that identifies the points most vulnerable to data augmentation operations and
corresponding importance scores; And (ii) a new information-preserving scheme
that preserves the critical information in the augmented samples and ensures
the diversity of augmented data adaptively. We divide data augmentation methods
into three categories according to the operation types and integrate these
approaches into our framework accordingly. After being integrated into our
framework, the robustness of data augmentation methods can be enhanced and
their full potential can be unleashed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
although being simple, IPF-RDA consistently improves the performance of
numerous commonly used state-of-the-art data augmentation methods with popular
deep models on a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, CUHK03, Market1501, Oxford Flower, and MNIST, where its
performance and scalability are stressed. The implementation is available at

TL;DR: ProtoVQA是一个基于原型的框架，通过问题感知原型和空间约束匹配，提供可解释的视觉问答解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉问答（VQA）中，模型不仅需要提供准确答案，还需要可理解的解释，尤其是在医疗和自动驾驶等关键领域。

Method: ProtoVQA通过学习问题感知原型和空间约束匹配，将答案与图像区域关联，并通过共享原型骨干支持回答和定位任务。

Result: 在Visual7W数据集上，ProtoVQA在保持竞争力的准确性的同时，提供了细粒度的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoVQA推动了透明和可信赖的VQA系统的发展。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is increasingly used in diverse applications
ranging from general visual reasoning to safety-critical domains such as
medical imaging and autonomous systems, where models must provide not only
accurate answers but also explanations that humans can easily understand and
verify. Prototype-based modeling has shown promise for interpretability by
grounding predictions in semantically meaningful regions for purely visual
reasoning tasks, yet remains underexplored in the context of VQA. We present
ProtoVQA, a unified prototypical framework that (i) learns question-aware
prototypes that serve as reasoning anchors, connecting answers to
discriminative image regions, (ii) applies spatially constrained matching to
ensure that the selected evidence is coherent and semantically relevant, and
(iii) supports both answering and grounding tasks through a shared prototype
backbone. To assess explanation quality, we propose the Visual-Linguistic
Alignment Score (VLAS), which measures how well the model's attended regions
align with ground-truth evidence. Experiments on Visual7W show that ProtoVQA
yields faithful, fine-grained explanations while maintaining competitive
accuracy, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy VQA systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动视图选择方法（AVS），用于多视角人群计数和定位，解决了现有方法在跨场景和有限标签需求下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注输入视图的准确性，忽略了选择最佳视角以全面感知场景中人群的问题，且缺乏跨场景能力和需要大量标注数据。

Method: 提出了独立视图选择方法（IVS）和主动视图选择方法（AVS），后者联合优化视图选择、标注和下游任务。

Result: 实验表明AVS在跨场景和有限标签需求下优于现有方法，应用场景更广。

Conclusion: AVS方法在多视角人群计数和定位任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting and localization fuse the input multi-views for
estimating the crowd number or locations on the ground. Existing methods mainly
focus on accurately predicting on the crowd shown in the input views, which
neglects the problem of choosing the `best' camera views to perceive all crowds
well in the scene. Besides, existing view selection methods require massive
labeled views and images, and lack the ability for cross-scene settings,
reducing their application scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we study the view
selection issue for better scene-level multi-view crowd counting and
localization results with cross-scene ability and limited label demand, instead
of input-view-level results. We first propose an independent view selection
method (IVS) that considers view and scene geometries in the view selection
strategy and conducts the view selection, labeling, and downstream tasks
independently. Based on IVS, we also put forward an active view selection
method (AVS) that jointly optimizes the view selection, labeling, and
downstream tasks. In AVS, we actively select the labeled views and consider
both the view/scene geometries and the predictions of the downstream task
models in the view selection process. Experiments on multi-view counting and
localization tasks demonstrate the cross-scene and the limited label demand
advantages of the proposed active view selection method (AVS), outperforming
existing methods and with wider application scenarios.

Method: 提出色度-强度分解框架，将HSI分解为空间平滑的强度图和光谱变化的色度立方体，并开发CIDNet网络，结合空间-光谱Transformer和噪声估计模块。

Result: 在合成和真实CASSI数据集上，CIDNet在光谱和色度保真度上表现优异。

Conclusion: CIDNet通过分解和自适应噪声处理，显著提升了HSI重建质量，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), the captured measurement
entangles spatial and spectral information, posing a severely ill-posed inverse
problem for hyperspectral images (HSIs) reconstruction. Moreover, the captured
radiance inherently depends on scene illumination, making it difficult to
recover the intrinsic spectral reflectance that remains invariant to lighting
conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a chromaticity-intensity
decomposition framework, which disentangles an HSI into a spatially smooth
intensity map and a spectrally variant chromaticity cube. The chromaticity
encodes lighting-invariant reflectance, enriched with high-frequency spatial
details and local spectral sparsity. Building on this decomposition, we develop
CIDNet, a Chromaticity-Intensity Decomposition unfolding network within a
dual-camera CASSI system. CIDNet integrates a hybrid spatial-spectral
Transformer tailored to reconstruct fine-grained and sparse spectral
chromaticity and a degradation-aware, spatially-adaptive noise estimation
module that captures anisotropic noise across iterative stages. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world CASSI datasets demonstrate that
our method achieves superior performance in both spectral and chromaticity
fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available.

Conclusion: InstanceAssemble显著提升了L2I生成的精确性和灵活性，并提出了新的评估基准和指标。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation
have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate
precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I
methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose
InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via
instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes
(bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual
content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models
through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image
benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image
generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further
introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to
more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate
that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under
complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse
style LoRA modules.

Abstract: Personalized animal image generation is challenging due to rich appearance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定置信度阈值选择伪标签，无法应对网络过度自信倾向，且丢弃低置信度预测会破坏空间语义连续性。

Method: CSL将伪标签选择建模为置信度分布特征空间中的凸优化问题，并引入随机掩码学习低可靠性区域的上下文关系。

Result: 在Pascal、Cityscapes和COCO基准测试中，CSL表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSL通过样本特定决策边界和上下文学习，有效提升了伪标签选择的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: While significant advances exist in pseudo-label generation for
semi-supervised semantic segmentation, pseudo-label selection remains
understudied. Existing methods typically use fixed confidence thresholds to
retain high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels. However, these methods
cannot cope with network overconfidence tendency, where correct and incorrect
predictions overlap significantly in high-confidence regions, making separation
challenging and amplifying model cognitive bias. Meanwhile, the direct
discarding of low-confidence predictions disrupts spatial-semantic continuity,
causing critical context loss. We propose Confidence Separable Learning (CSL)
to address these limitations. CSL formulates pseudo-label selection as a convex
optimization problem within the confidence distribution feature space,
establishing sample-specific decision boundaries to distinguish reliable from
unreliable predictions. Additionally, CSL introduces random masking of reliable
pixels to guide the network in learning contextual relationships from
low-reliability regions, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of discarding
uncertain predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Pascal,
Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks show that CSL performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods. Code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: Text-Scene通过语言使3D场景内容更易理解，为3D任务规划提供了新工具。

Abstract: Enabling agents to understand and interact with complex 3D scenes is a
fundamental challenge for embodied artificial intelligence systems. While
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in
2D image understanding, extending such capabilities to 3D scenes remains
difficult: 1) 3D environment involves richer concepts such as spatial
relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on, 2) the absence of
large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Scene, a framework that automatically parses 3D
scenes into textual descriptions for scene understanding. Given a 3D scene, our
model identifies object attributes and spatial relationships, and then
generates a coherent summary of the whole scene, bridging the gap between 3D
observation and language without requiring human-in-the-loop intervention. By
leveraging both geometric analysis and MLLMs, Text-Scene produces descriptions
that are accurate, detailed, and human-interpretable, capturing object-level
details and global-level context. Experimental results on benchmarks
demonstrate that our textual parses can faithfully represent 3D scenes and
benefit downstream tasks. To evaluate the reasoning capability of MLLMs, we
present InPlan3D, a comprehensive benchmark for 3D task planning, consisting of
3174 long-term planning tasks across 636 indoor scenes. We emphasize clarity
and accessibility in our approach, aiming to make 3D scene content
understandable through language. Code and datasets will be released.

Conclusion: 3DPain和ViTPain为自动化疼痛评估提供了可控、多样且临床可靠的基础。

Abstract: Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for
non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been
limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and

cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or
clinically validated pain levels.
  We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and

textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to
synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU

trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical
reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse,
and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Min的方法，通过学习有益噪声来缓解类增量学习中的参数漂移问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在类增量学习中表现良好，但轻量级微调会导致参数漂移，损害模型的泛化能力。研究发现噪声并非总是有害，适当噪声可以抑制低相关性特征，为未来任务留出空间。

Method: 提出Mixture of Noise (Min)方法，通过学习任务特定噪声并动态调整权重，将有益噪声嵌入中间特征以掩盖低效模式。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，Min在大多数增量设置中达到最先进性能，尤其在50步增量设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究表明有益噪声在持续学习中具有显著潜力，Min方法有效缓解了参数漂移问题。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories
while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show
promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply
lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby
compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter
drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns
learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is
not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned
from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing
appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a
margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for
CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to
mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks.
Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of
new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture
of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the
intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly
outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the
significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning.

TL;DR: CAMBench-QR是一个基于QR码结构的基准测试，用于评估视觉解释方法的结构忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉解释方法虽然看似合理，但缺乏对结构的忠实性。

Method: 利用QR码的几何结构（如定位图案、时序线、模块网格）生成合成数据，并设计结构感知的评估指标。

Result: 测试了多种CAM方法（如LayerCAM、EigenGrad-CAM、XGrad-CAM），提供了零样本和微调两种场景下的性能评估。

Conclusion: CAMBench-QR可作为评估视觉解释方法是否真正结构感知的简单、可复现的标准。

Abstract: Visual explanations are often plausible but not structurally faithful. We
introduce CAMBench-QR, a structure-aware benchmark that leverages the canonical
geometry of QR codes (finder patterns, timing lines, module grid) to test
whether CAM methods place saliency on requisite substructures while avoiding
background. CAMBench-QR synthesizes QR/non-QR data with exact masks and
controlled distortions, and reports structure-aware metrics (Finder/Timing Mass
Ratios, Background Leakage, coverage AUCs, Distance-to-Structure) alongside
causal occlusion, insertion/deletion faithfulness, robustness, and latency. We
benchmark representative, efficient CAMs (LayerCAM, EigenGrad-CAM, XGrad-CAM)
under two practical regimes of zero-shot and last-block fine-tuning. The
benchmark, metrics, and training recipes provide a simple, reproducible
yardstick for structure-aware evaluation of visual explanations. Hence we
propose that CAMBENCH-QR can be used as a litmus test of whether visual
explanations are truly structure-aware.

Motivation: 传统的三平面表示方法存在特征纠缠和特征穿透问题，导致镜像伪影和细节生成困难。球面三平面虽解决了特征纠缠，但存在特征图利用不均的问题。

Method: 引入混合平面表示，结合平面和球面平面的优点；采用近等面积扭曲策略优化球面平面；生成单通道统一特征图以避免特征穿透。

Result: HyPlaneHead方法在头部图像合成中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 混合平面表示有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了3D头部图像合成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Tri-plane-like representations have been widely adopted in 3D-aware GANs for
head image synthesis and other 3D object/scene modeling tasks due to their
efficiency. However, querying features via Cartesian coordinate projection
often leads to feature entanglement, which results in mirroring artifacts. A
recent work, SphereHead, attempted to address this issue by introducing
spherical tri-planes based on a spherical coordinate system. While it
successfully mitigates feature entanglement, SphereHead suffers from uneven
mapping between the square feature maps and the spherical planes, leading to
inefficient feature map utilization during rendering and difficulties in
generating fine image details. Moreover, both tri-plane and spherical tri-plane
representations share a subtle yet persistent issue: feature penetration across
convolutional channels can cause interference between planes, particularly when
one plane dominates the others. These challenges collectively prevent
tri-plane-based methods from reaching their full potential. In this paper, we
systematically analyze these problems for the first time and propose innovative
solutions to address them. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid-plane
(hy-plane for short) representation that combines the strengths of both planar
and spherical planes while avoiding their respective drawbacks. We further
enhance the spherical plane by replacing the conventional theta-phi warping
with a novel near-equal-area warping strategy, which maximizes the effective
utilization of the square feature map. In addition, our generator synthesizes a
single-channel unified feature map instead of multiple feature maps in separate
channels, thereby effectively eliminating feature penetration. With a series of
technical improvements, our hy-plane representation enables our method,
HyPlaneHead, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in full-head image
synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffEye是一个基于扩散模型的训练框架，用于生成连续且多样化的眼动轨迹，解决了现有方法无法捕捉人类视觉注意力多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于离散的注视点序列（scanpath），忽略了原始眼动轨迹的丰富信息，且无法反映人类视觉注意力的多样性。

Method: DiffEye利用扩散模型，结合视觉刺激和新型的对应位置嵌入（CPE），直接从原始眼动轨迹中学习，生成高质量的眼动模式。

Result: DiffEye在scanpath生成任务中达到最先进性能，并首次实现了连续眼动轨迹的生成。

Conclusion: DiffEye通过利用原始眼动数据，显著提升了眼动轨迹生成的多样性和真实性。

Abstract: Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction,
which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a
sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich
information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover,
most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human
subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of
fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and
stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges,
we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model
continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural
images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli
and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding
(CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic
features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories
rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in
human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement
patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated
trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting
in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual
attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images
using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking
data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the
first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories. Project

Conclusion: MMPart解决了现有方法在结构控制和遮挡处理上的不足，提升了3D生成的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Generative 3D modeling has advanced rapidly, driven by applications in VR/AR,
metaverse, and robotics. However, most methods represent the target object as a
closed mesh devoid of any structural information, limiting editing, animation,
and semantic understanding. Part-aware 3D generation addresses this problem by
decomposing objects into meaningful components, but existing pipelines face
challenges: in existing methods, the user has no control over which objects are
separated and how model imagine the occluded parts in isolation phase. In this
paper, we introduce MMPart, an innovative framework for generating part-aware
3D models from a single image. We first use a VLM to generate a set of prompts
based on the input image and user descriptions. In the next step, a generative
model generates isolated images of each object based on the initial image and
the previous step's prompts as supervisor (which control the pose and guide
model how imagine previously occluded areas). Each of those images then enters
the multi-view generation stage, where a number of consistent images from
different views are generated. Finally, a reconstruction model converts each of
these multi-view images into a 3D model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人造卫星数量增加，其反射阳光产生的轨迹干扰天文观测，导致光测误差和虚假信号，需准确识别。

Method: 使用U-Net深度学习网络和LSD算法，基于375张模拟图像训练模型。

Result: SNR>3时检测率超99%；在真实数据中召回率79.57，精确率74.56。

Conclusion: 模型能有效检测卫星轨迹，适用于实际观测数据。

Abstract: With the rapid increase in the number of artificial satellites, astronomical
imaging is experiencing growing interference. When these satellites reflect
sunlight, they produce streak-like artifacts in photometry images. Such
satellite trails can introduce false sources and cause significant photometric
errors. As a result, accurately identifying the positions of satellite trails
in observational data has become essential. In this work, we propose a
satellite trail detection model that combines the U-Net deep neural network for
image segmentation with the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The model is
trained on 375 simulated images of satellite trails, generated using data from
the Mini-SiTian Array. Experimental results show that for trails with a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the detection rate exceeds 99.
Additionally, when applied to real observational data from the Mini-SiTian
Array, the model achieves a recall of 79.57 and a precision of 74.56.

Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在视觉问答（VQA）中表现优异，但MCQA中的选择偏差（如模型偏好特定选项或位置）尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过细粒度MCQA基准测试（分易、中、难三级），提出基于推理时logit的去偏方法，利用通用和上下文提示估计偏差向量并进行置信度自适应校正。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了LVLMs在MCQA中的局限性，并提出了一种提升其细粒度视觉推理鲁棒性的实用方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, particularly Visual Question Answering (VQA). While
prior work has explored unimodal biases in VQA, the problem of selection bias
in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where models may favor specific
option tokens (e.g., "A") or positions, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we investigate both the presence and nature of selection bias in LVLMs through
fine-grained MCQA benchmarks spanning easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels,
defined by the semantic similarity of the options. We further propose an
inference-time logit-level debiasing method that estimates an ensemble bias
vector from general and contextual prompts and applies confidence-adaptive
corrections to the model's output. Our method mitigates bias without retraining
and is compatible with frozen LVLMs. Extensive experiments across several
state-of-the-art models reveal consistent selection biases that intensify with
task difficulty, and show that our mitigation approach significantly reduces
bias while improving accuracy in challenging settings. This work offers new
insights into the limitations of LVLMs in MCQA and presents a practical
approach to improve their robustness in fine-grained visual reasoning. Datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因图像噪声和帧间信息不完整而受限，需更鲁棒的表面重建和插值技术。

Method: 采用高斯溅射（GS）插值机制，将医学影像数据建模为3D空间中的高斯分布，实现帧间插值和表面重建。

Result: MedGS训练效率高，噪声鲁棒性强，支持复杂解剖结构的精确建模，减少伪影。

Conclusion: MedGS适用于医学影像的规模化应用，具有灵活编辑和高保真重建优势。

Abstract: Multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data, derived from
ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and potentially computed
tomography (CT), provide a widely adopted approach for non-invasive anatomical
visualization. Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this
setting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation.
Traditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete
information between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a
semi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a
Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework,
medical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames
embedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This
representation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface
reconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more
efficient training than traditional neural implicit methods. Its explicit
GS-based representation enhances noise robustness, allows flexible editing, and
supports precise modeling of complex anatomical structures with fewer
artifacts. These features make MedGS highly suitable for scalable and practical
applications in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法依赖额外图像编码器和生成模型，未能揭示分类器自身特征空间和决策边界的内在特性。

Method: Mirror-CFE直接在分类器特征空间中操作，学习从特征空间到图像空间的映射函数，保持距离关系，实现源图像到反事实的平滑过渡。

Result: 在四个图像数据集上的实验表明，Mirror-CFE在有效性和输入相似性方面优于现有解释方法。

Conclusion: Mirror-CFE通过生成逐步过渡的可视化，揭示了分类器决策过程中特征的演变，提供了更直观的解释。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFE) for deep image classifiers aim to reveal
how minimal input changes lead to different model decisions, providing critical
insights for model interpretation and improvement. However, existing CFE
methods often rely on additional image encoders and generative models to create
plausible images, neglecting the classifier's own feature space and decision
boundaries. As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and
decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we
propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual
explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating
decision boundaries as mirrors that ``reflect'' feature representations in the
mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space
while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between
source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four
image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in
validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art
explanation methods. Finally, mirror-CFE provides interpretable visualization
of the classifier's decision process by generating step-wise transitions that
reveal how features evolve as classification confidence changes.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，L2M-Reg比现有的基于ICP和基于平面的方法更精确且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: L2M-Reg为存在模型不确定性的LiDAR到模型配准提供了一种新颖的建筑物级别解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point
clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital
twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction,
change detection and model refinement. However, achieving accurate
LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging,
particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models
at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing
L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for
model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable
plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model,
and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally
efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg
provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration
when model uncertainty is present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的数据集特定测试且忽略通道间依赖关系，无法高效利用通道不平衡性。

Method: 利用权重方差、偏置大小和成对相关性等参数统计量识别重要通道，提出ISCS结构并设计通道分组策略。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效降低比特率和计算量，同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为现有学习压缩框架提供了实用且模块化的改进方案。

Abstract: Prior studies in learned image compression (LIC) consistently show that only
a small subset of latent channels is critical for reconstruction, while many
others carry limited information. Exploiting this imbalance could improve both
coding and computational efficiency, yet existing approaches often rely on
costly, dataset-specific ablation tests and typically analyze channels in
isolation, ignoring their interdependencies.
  We propose a generalizable, dataset-agnostic method to identify and organize
important channels in pretrained VAE-based LIC models. Instead of brute-force
empirical evaluations, our approach leverages intrinsic parameter
statistics-weight variances, bias magnitudes, and pairwise correlations-to
estimate channel importance. This analysis reveals a consistent organizational
structure, termed the Invariant Salient Channel Space (ISCS), where
Salient-Core channels capture dominant structures and Salient-Auxiliary
channels provide complementary details. Building on ISCS, we introduce a
deterministic channel ordering and grouping strategy that enables
slice-parallel decoding, reduces redundancy, and improves bitrate efficiency.
  Experiments across multiple LIC architectures demonstrate that our method
effectively reduces bitrate and computation while maintaining reconstruction
quality, providing a practical and modular enhancement to existing learned
compression frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce ConfidentSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM
system for robust, highfidelity RGB-only reconstruction. Addressing geometric
inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable
depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a
confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates
depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata
ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability
estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to
generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy
depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently
adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a
DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global
bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD,
ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view
synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in
challenging conditions. ConfidentSplat underscores the efficacy of principled,
confidence-aware sensor fusion for advancing state-of-the-art dense visual
SLAM.

Abstract: The gaming and entertainment industry is rapidly evolving, driven by
immersive experiences and the integration of generative AI (GAI) technologies.
Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the
diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are
often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do
not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover,
benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent.
  To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale,
multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the
shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$
provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5,
offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80
scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution
(SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and
$\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set
enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark
several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines.
While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation,
$\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing
the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration,
compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud
gaming and entertainment.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot

often overlooking the issues of semantic over-smoothing and token uniformity.
We propose SAM-DCE, which balances local discrimination and global semantics
while mitigating token uniformity, enhancing inter-class separability, and
enriching mask decoding with fine-grained, consistent representations.
Extensive experiments on diverse medical benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: As an essential vision task, infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has seen
significant advancements through deep learning. However, critical limitations
in current evaluation protocols impede further progress. First, existing
methods rely on fragmented pixel- and target-level specific metrics, which
fails to provide a comprehensive view of model capabilities. Second, an
excessive emphasis on overall performance scores obscures crucial error
analysis, which is vital for identifying failure modes and improving real-world
system performance. Third, the field predominantly adopts dataset-specific
training-testing paradigms, hindering the understanding of model robustness and
generalization across diverse infrared scenarios. This paper addresses these
issues by introducing a hybrid-level metric incorporating pixel- and
target-level performance, proposing a systematic error analysis method, and
emphasizing the importance of cross-dataset evaluation. These aim to offer a
more thorough and rational hierarchical analysis framework, ultimately
fostering the development of more effective and robust IRSTD models. An
open-source toolkit has be released to facilitate standardized benchmarking.

TL;DR: CoMTIP是一种新的对比掩码文本-图像预训练框架，用于空间转录组学，结合图像、基因名称和表达值，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖基因名称或表达值，忽略了基因语义和定量关联，且缺乏视觉线索的利用。

Method: CoMTIP通过掩码特征建模重建图像块，并行处理基因文本并保留基因-值关联，在共享空间中对齐图像和文本表示。

Result: CoMTIP在公共数据集上超越现有方法，支持零样本基因表达预测。

Conclusion: CoMTIP通过多模态联合学习，显著提升了空间转录组学任务的性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics aims to connect high-resolution histology images with
spatially resolved gene expression. To achieve better performance on downstream
tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required
to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and
transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing
cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either
gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of
essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its
quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text
alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for
learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked
Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names,
and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial
transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct
occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch
applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in
parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings,
and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct
gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared
InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets
show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream
tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that
existing approaches do not provide.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于精确召回的数据合成方法，用于解决大规模图像合成中的模式崩溃问题，提升知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在小规模图像上表现良好，但在大规模图像合成中易出现模式崩溃，导致知识转移受限。

Method: 提出PRISM方法，包括能量引导分布对齐和多样化提示工程，确保合成数据与真实分布对齐并覆盖真实ID流形。

Result: 在大规模图像数据集上实验表明PRISM的优越性，且训练出的模型具有强领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: PRISM有效解决了数据合成中的精确召回挑战，提升了知识蒸馏的效果和模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access to the real in-distribution (ID) data. While existing
methods perform well on small-scale images, they suffer from mode collapse when
synthesizing large-scale images, resulting in limited knowledge transfer.
Recently, leveraging advanced generative models to synthesize photorealistic
images has emerged as a promising alternative. Nevertheless, directly using
off-the-shelf diffusion to generate datasets faces the precision-recall
challenges: 1) ensuring synthetic data aligns with the real distribution, and
2) ensuring coverage of the real ID manifold. In response, we propose PRISM, a
precision-recall informed synthesis method. Specifically, we introduce
Energy-guided Distribution Alignment to avoid the generation of
out-of-distribution samples, and design the Diversified Prompt Engineering to
enhance coverage of the real ID manifold. Extensive experiments on various
large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PRISM. Moreover, we
demonstrate that models trained with PRISM exhibit strong domain
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多专家Mamba系统（ME-Mamba），用于整合病理图像和基因组数据，实现高效的癌症生存分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像通常仅提供幻灯片级别的标签，限制了从千兆像素WSIs中学习判别性表示的能力。多模态生存分析结合病理图像和基因组数据是一种有前景的方法。

Method: 设计了病理专家和基因组专家分别处理单模态数据，采用Mamba架构提取特征；通过协同专家实现模态融合，利用最优传输和全局跨模态融合损失增强一致性。

Result: 在TCGA的五个数据集上展示了最先进的性能，实现了稳定且准确的生存分析。

Conclusion: ME-Mamba系统能够高效整合多模态数据，提升癌症生存分析的准确性。

Abstract: Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only
provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative
representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of
high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis
integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising
approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures
discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient
integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary
information fusion without losing critical information from individual
modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis.
Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to
process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba
architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based
scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long
instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information.
Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It
explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities
via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through
a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused
feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further
integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics
Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate
survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive
experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SLAM-Former通过统一的Transformer框架实现了高效的SLAM功能，展示了神经网络在SLAM任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We present SLAM-Former, a novel neural approach that integrates full SLAM
capabilities into a single transformer. Similar to traditional SLAM systems,
SLAM-Former comprises both a frontend and a backend that operate in tandem. The
frontend processes sequential monocular images in real-time for incremental
mapping and tracking, while the backend performs global refinement to ensure a
geometrically consistent result. This alternating execution allows the frontend
and backend to mutually promote one another, enhancing overall system
performance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SLAM-Former
achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to

TL;DR: CoBEVMoE提出了一种基于BEV空间和动态专家混合架构的协作感知框架，通过动态生成专家模型处理异构特征，显著提升了感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中间融合方法主要关注对齐相似特征，忽视了代理间的感知多样性，限制了协作感知的效果。

Method: 采用BEV空间和动态专家混合架构（DMoE），动态生成专家模型处理异构特征，并引入动态专家度量损失（DEML）增强专家多样性。

Result: 在OPV2V和DAIR-V2X-C数据集上，CoBEVMoE在BEV分割和3D目标检测任务中分别提升了1.5%和3.0%的性能。

Conclusion: CoBEVMoE通过异构特征建模显著提升了多代理协作感知的性能，验证了专家模型的动态生成和多样性增强的有效性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve
perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due
to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire
heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily
focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity
among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel
collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV)
space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In
DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a
specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while
attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to
explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents.
Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance
inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused
representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets
demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically,
it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the
AP@50 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the
effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent
collaborative perception. The source code will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂（AMFs）检测因形态学特征细微、类别不平衡和病理学家间差异而具有挑战性，需高效分类方法。

Method: 采用Virchow等基础模型结合LoRA进行微调，实验不同LoRA秩和数据分割方式，评估模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基础模型结合高效适应策略在非典型有丝分裂分类中表现优异，但需提升特异性和领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are rare abnormal cell divisions associated
with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Their detection remains a
significant challenge due to subtle morphological cues, class imbalance, and
inter-observer variability among pathologists. The MIDOG 2025 challenge
introduced a dedicated track for atypical mitosis classification, enabling
systematic evaluation of deep learning methods. In this study, we investigated
the use of large vision foundation models, including Virchow, Virchow2, and
UNI, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We
conducted extensive experiments with different LoRA ranks, as well as random
and group-based data splits, to analyze robustness under varied conditions. Our
best approach, Virchow with LoRA rank 8 and ensemble of three-fold
cross-validation, achieved a balanced accuracy of 88.37% on the preliminary
test set, ranking joint 9th in the challenge leaderboard. These results
highlight the promise of foundation models with efficient adaptation strategies
for the classification of atypical mitosis, while underscoring the need for
improvements in specificity and domain generalization.

TL;DR: DepTR-MOT是一种基于DETR的多目标跟踪方法，通过引入深度信息提升跟踪性能，解决了遮挡和近距离交互问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于2D线索的跟踪方法在机器人环境中因密集目标和频繁遮挡表现不佳，深度信息潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出两种创新：基于基础模型的实例级软深度标签监督和密集深度图蒸馏，以增强深度预测和全局一致性。

Result: 在QuadTrack和DanceTrack数据集上分别取得HOTA分数27.59和44.47，显著提升遮挡和近距离跟踪效果。

Conclusion: DepTR-MOT通过深度信息显著提升了多目标跟踪的鲁棒性，尤其在机器人环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic
perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D
cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under
occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues
are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and
frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to
alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations,
leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of
depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based
detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we
propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft
depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the
distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These
strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference,
without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost.
By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD
paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges.
Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47,
respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT
dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and
close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking. The source code will be made

Result: 实验表明，ProSFDA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSFDA通过原型引导策略有效提升了无源域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) enables domain adaptation for semantic
segmentation of Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) using only a well-trained source
model and unlabeled target domain data. However, the lack of ground-truth
labels in the target domain often leads to the generation of noisy
pseudo-labels. Such noise impedes the effective mitigation of domain shift
(DS). To address this challenge, we propose ProSFDA, a prototype-guided SFDA
framework. It employs prototype-weighted pseudo-labels to facilitate reliable
self-training (ST) under pseudo-labels noise. We, in addition, introduce a
prototype-contrast strategy that encourages the aggregation of features
belonging to the same class, enabling the model to learn discriminative target
domain representations without relying on ground-truth supervision. Extensive
experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: EmbodiedSplat能高效适应多样环境，显著提升模拟到现实的迁移效果。

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and
evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack
photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with
expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major
challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that
personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment
environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our
method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to
bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training
environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes
via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world
conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies,
pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their
impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental
results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both
zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and
synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate
improvements of 20\% and 40\% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover,
our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87--0.97) for the
reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to
diverse environments with minimal effort. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高分辨率图像时存在计算成本高或依赖大规模标注数据的问题，需要一种更高效且无需标注的解决方案。

Method: 通过将MLLM中间层的噪声注意力图转化为高质量伪RoI标签，训练轻量级区域提议网络（RPN），实现高效的单次前向预测。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5架构上验证，仅需少量数据训练即可在TextVQA、DocVQA和V-Star等基准上实现超过10%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SD-RPN提供了一种无需昂贵监督或全模型微调的实用方案，显著提升了MLLMs的细粒度感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual
information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire
high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods
leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they
typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on
large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the
model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate,
requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow
auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient,
annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves
this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy
attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI
labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these
labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more
precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in
a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling
RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly
multi-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into
the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K)
question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and
generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen
benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a
practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of
MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning. Code is

Conclusion: VideoArtGS为基于视频的关节物体重建设立了新基准，并实现了实用的数字孪生创建。

Abstract: Building digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video presents
an essential challenge in computer vision, which requires simultaneous
reconstruction of object geometry, part segmentation, and articulation
parameters from limited viewpoint inputs. Monocular video offers an attractive
input format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging
to disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision
alone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed
estimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate
the issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains
largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel
approach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects
from monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes
3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation
parameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for
articulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion.
VideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh
reconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of
magnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital
twin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for
video-based articulated object reconstruction. Our work is made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件数据具有高时间分辨率和低延迟的优势，但标记数据的稀缺限制了其在手部姿态估计中的应用。

Method: 通过构建伪事件-RGB对，分解手部运动为逐步动作，并引入运动反转约束来生成更真实的事件数据。

Result: 在真实事件数据上，RPEP比现有方法性能提升24%，且在少量标记样本下表现优异。

Conclusion: RPEP为事件数据的手部姿态估计提供了高效解决方案，适合实际部署。

Abstract: This paper presents RPEP, the first pre-training method for event-based 3D
hand pose estimation using labeled RGB images and unpaired, unlabeled event
data. Event data offer significant benefits such as high temporal resolution
and low latency, but their application to hand pose estimation is still limited
by the scarcity of labeled training data. To address this, we repurpose real
RGB datasets to train event-based estimators. This is done by constructing
pseudo-event-RGB pairs, where event data is generated and aligned with the
ground-truth poses of RGB images. Unfortunately, existing pseudo-event
generation techniques assume stationary objects, thus struggling to handle
non-stationary, dynamically moving hands. To overcome this, RPEP introduces a
novel generation strategy that decomposes hand movements into smaller,
step-by-step motions. This decomposition allows our method to capture temporal
changes in articulation, constructing more realistic event data for a moving
hand. Additionally, RPEP imposes a motion reversal constraint, regularizing
event generation using reversed motion. Extensive experiments show that our
pre-trained model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real
event data, achieving up to 24% improvement on EvRealHands. Moreover, it
delivers strong performance with minimal labeled samples for fine-tuning,
making it well-suited for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 自监督大规模视觉模型可作为机器人操作中动作扩散策略的有效感知前端，值得进一步探索无标签预训练的潜力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates DINOv3, a recent large-scale self-supervised vision
backbone, for visuomotor diffusion policy learning in robotic manipulation. We
investigate whether a purely self-supervised encoder can match or surpass
conventional supervised ImageNet-pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet-18) under
three regimes: training from scratch, frozen, and finetuned. Across four
benchmark tasks (Push-T, Lift, Can, Square) using a unified FiLM-conditioned
diffusion policy, we find that (i) finetuned DINOv3 matches or exceeds
ResNet-18 on several tasks, (ii) frozen DINOv3 remains competitive, indicating
strong transferable priors, and (iii) self-supervised features improve sample
efficiency and robustness. These results support self-supervised large visual
models as effective, generalizable perceptual front-ends for action diffusion
policies, motivating further exploration of scalable label-free pretraining in
robotic manipulation. Compared to using ResNet18 as a backbone, our approach
with DINOv3 achieves up to a 10% absolute increase in test-time success rates
on challenging tasks such as Can, and on-the-par performance in tasks like
Lift, PushT, and Square.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型依赖静态知识，难以在不重新训练的情况下整合新数据。

Method: 提出VidCLearn框架，采用师生架构、生成回放、时间一致性损失和视频检索模块。

Result: 实验表明VidCLearn在视觉质量、语义对齐和时间连贯性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VidCLearn为文本到视频生成提供了一种高效且动态更新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the
creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While
current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text,
they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new
data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose
VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video
generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student
model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model
helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay.
Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion
smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at
inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally
efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation
performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline
methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.

TL;DR: MO R-CNN是一个轻量级多光谱定向检测框架，通过异构特征提取网络（HFEN）、单模态监督（SMS）和基于条件的多模态标签融合（CMLF）提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱图像定向检测面临模态内和模态间差异的挑战，现有方法计算复杂且内存消耗高，限制了性能。

Method: 提出HFEN自适应对齐和增强多模态特征，SMS约束多尺度特征学习，CMLF基于规则融合多模态标签。

Result: 在DroneVehicle、VEDAI和OGSOD数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: MO R-CNN通过轻量级设计显著提升了多光谱定向检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Oriented object detection for multi-spectral imagery faces significant
challenges due to differences both within and between modalities. Although
existing methods have improved detection accuracy through complex network
architectures, their high computational complexity and memory consumption
severely restrict their performance. Motivated by the success of large kernel
convolutions in remote sensing, we propose MO R-CNN, a lightweight framework
for multi-spectral oriented detection featuring heterogeneous feature
extraction network (HFEN), single modality supervision (SMS), and
condition-based multimodal label fusion (CMLF). HFEN leverages inter-modal
differences to adaptively align, merge, and enhance multi-modal features. SMS
constrains multi-scale features and enables the model to learn from multiple
modalities. CMLF fuses multimodal labels based on specific rules, providing the
model with a more robust and consistent supervisory signal. Experiments on the
DroneVehicle, VEDAI and OGSOD datasets prove the superiority of our method. The

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但常出现物体不完整的问题，影响下游应用性能。研究发现RandomCrop数据增强是主要原因。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的解决方案，通过惩罚早期去噪步骤中图像边界的激活值，适用于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著提升了物体完整性和图像质量，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了扩散模型中物体不完整的问题，且易于实现和部署。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I)
generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains.
However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of
objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in
downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete
object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely
used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability,
disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a
training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries
during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to
pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image
quality.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了稀疏标注下的检测性能。

Abstract: Sparse annotation in remote sensing object detection poses significant
challenges due to dense object distributions and category imbalances. Although
existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in
pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and
inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an
LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote
sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence
pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a
Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns
pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust
supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an
Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning
branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information.
Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly
improving detection performance under sparse annotations.

Result: 在LSVOS挑战赛RVOS赛道中，J&F得分67.45，领先第二名2.80分。

Conclusion: 高效的增强分割和测试时集成显著提升了RVOS任务的性能。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking
objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding
fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA,
which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video
segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit
segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG]
token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective
Averaged Sa2VA SaSaSa2VA to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge
(RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $J\&F$ of 67.45, ranking first and
surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies
demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling
substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS. The code is released in Sa2VA

Motivation: 解决传统HTR方法在低资源领域（如历史档案或小型现代数据集）中因需要大量标注数据而难以应用的问题。

Method: 采用迭代自举方法，结合最优传输（OT）对齐未标注图像的视觉特征与语义词汇表示，生成伪标签并逐步扩展训练集。

Result: 在低资源HTR基准测试中显著提高了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源HTR提供了一种高效解决方案，展示了视觉-语义对齐的潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a task of central importance in the
field of document image understanding. State-of-the-art methods for HTR require
the use of extensive annotated sets for training, making them impractical for
low-resource domains like historical archives or limited-size modern
collections. This paper introduces a novel framework that, unlike the standard
HTR model paradigm, can leverage mild prior knowledge of lexical
characteristics; this is ideal for scenarios where labeled data are scarce. We
propose an iterative bootstrapping approach that aligns visual features
extracted from unlabeled images with semantic word representations using
Optimal Transport (OT). Starting with a minimal set of labeled examples, the
framework iteratively matches word images to text labels, generates
pseudo-labels for high-confidence alignments, and retrains the recognizer on
the growing dataset. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our iterative
visual-semantic alignment scheme significantly improves recognition accuracy on
low-resource HTR benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with
their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models
such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic
renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also
potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant
concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these
concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain
underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for
diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly
applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To
address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a
novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair
construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their
associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training
approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual
contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our
comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure,
explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method
effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing
unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts. The
code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/VCE.

Conclusion: CHMFFN通过多尺度特征提取和动态特征融合，显著提升了高光谱变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral change detection (HCD) aims to accurately identify land-cover
changes in hyperspectral images of the same area acquired at different times,
with key applications in environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. To
address limitations of existing methods, such as insufficient use of multiscale
features and low efficiency in differential feature fusion, this paper proposes
a cross-hierarchical multi-feature fusion network (CHMFFN) based on a
multiscale encoder-decoder architecture. The front-end adopts a multiscale
feature extraction subnetwork, built on an encoder-decoder backbone with
residual connections and a dual-core channel-spatial attention (DCCSA) module
to extract spectral-spatial-temporal features (SSTF). The encoder captures
multiscale features from shallow details to deep semantics via residual blocks
and convolutional kernels with varying receptive fields. The decoder restores
spatial resolution and suppresses noise information through skip connections
integrating encoder features. Additionally, a spectral-temporal change feature
learning (STCFL) module learns cross-temporal change features at different
levels, strengthening inter-temporal difference capture. An adaptive fusion of
advanced features (AFAF) module dynamically balances hierarchical differential
features via adaptive weights, enhancing representation of complex changes.
Experiments on four public hyperspectral datasets show CHMFFN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness.

Abstract: Document image quality assessment (DIQA) is an important component for
various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), document
restoration, and the evaluation of document image processing systems. In this
paper, we introduce a subjective DIQA dataset DIQA-5000. The DIQA-5000 dataset
comprises 5,000 document images, generated by applying multiple document
enhancement techniques to 500 real-world images with diverse distortions. Each
enhanced image was rated by 15 subjects across three rating dimensions: overall
quality, sharpness, and color fidelity. Furthermore, we propose a specialized
no-reference DIQA model that exploits document layout features to maintain
quality perception at reduced resolutions to lower computational cost.
Recognizing that image quality is influenced by both low-level and high-level
visual features, we designed a feature fusion module to extract and integrate
multi-level features from document images. To generate multi-dimensional
scores, our model employs independent quality heads for each dimension to
predict score distributions, allowing it to learn distinct aspects of document
image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art general-purpose IQA models on both DIQA-5000 and an
additional document image dataset focused on OCR accuracy.

Conclusion: LCDiff通过分解和引导扩散模型，显著提升恶劣天气图像恢复质量，且无需显式退化提示。

Abstract: Adverse Weather Image Restoration (AWIR) is a highly challenging task due to
the unpredictable and dynamic nature of weather-related degradations.
Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex
degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on
the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in
inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel
framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition
Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN
processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling
degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components.
This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while
preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM
leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition,
eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM
incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising
network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features
in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather
driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new
benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Surgical simulation is essential for medical training, enabling practitioners
to develop crucial skills in a risk-free environment while improving patient
safety and surgical outcomes. However, conventional methods for building
simulation environments are cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult to scale,
often resulting in poor details and unrealistic simulations. In this paper, we
propose a Gaussian Splatting-based framework to directly reconstruct
interactive surgical scenes from endoscopic data while ensuring efficiency,
rendering quality, and realism. A key challenge in this data-driven simulation
paradigm is the restricted movement of endoscopic cameras, which limits
viewpoint diversity. As a result, the Gaussian Splatting representation
overfits specific perspectives, leading to reduced geometric accuracy. To
address this issue, we introduce a novel virtual camera-based regularization
method that adaptively samples virtual viewpoints around the scene and
incorporates them into the optimization process to mitigate overfitting. An
effective depth-based regularization is applied to both real and virtual views
to further refine the scene geometry. To enable fast deformation simulation, we
propose a sparse control node-based Material Point Method, which integrates
physical properties into the reconstructed scene while significantly reducing
computational costs. Experimental results on representative surgical data
demonstrate that our method can efficiently reconstruct and simulate surgical
scenes from sparse endoscopic views. Notably, our method takes only a few
minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene and is able to produce physically
plausible deformations in real-time with user-defined interactions.

Abstract: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images
and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond
single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image
benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct
relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling
models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance
their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal
correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring
joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual
contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and
logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to
comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each
instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning
strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively
guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their
ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking
multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models
reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that
MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning,
facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal
tasks.Our code and dataset are available at

Result: SimpSyn在所有数据集上的F1分数均优于Synful，且通过简单后处理策略进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合任务结构，为大规模连接组学提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Behavioural differences across organisms, whether healthy or pathological,
are closely tied to the structure of their neural circuits. Yet, the fine-scale
synaptic changes that give rise to these variations remain poorly understood,
in part due to persistent challenges in detecting synapses reliably and at
scale. Volume electron microscopy (EM) offers the resolution required to
capture synaptic architecture, but automated detection remains difficult due to
sparse annotations, morphological variability, and cross-dataset domain shifts.
To address this, we make three key contributions. First, we curate a diverse EM
benchmark spanning four datasets across two invertebrate species: adult and
larval Drosophila melanogaster, and Megaphragma viggianii (micro-WASP). Second,
we propose SimpSyn, a single-stage Residual U-Net trained to predict
dual-channel spherical masks around pre- and post-synaptic sites, designed to
prioritize training and inference speeds and annotation efficiency over
architectural complexity. Third, we benchmark SimpSyn against Buhmann et al.'s
Synful [1], a state-of-the-art multi-task model that jointly infers synaptic
pairs. Despite its simplicity, SimpSyn consistently outperforms Synful in
F1-score across all volumes for synaptic site detection. While generalization
across datasets remains limited, SimpSyn achieves competitive performance when
trained on the combined cohort. Finally, ablations reveal that simple
post-processing strategies - such as local peak detection and distance-based
filtering - yield strong performance without complex test-time heuristics.
Taken together, our results suggest that lightweight models, when aligned with
task structure, offer a practical and scalable solution for synapse detection
in large-scale connectomic pipelines.

Conclusion: AgriDoctor为智能农业提供了新的多模态交互范式。

Abstract: Accurate crop disease diagnosis is essential for sustainable agriculture and
global food security. Existing methods, which primarily rely on unimodal models
such as image-based classifiers and object detectors, are limited in their
ability to incorporate domain-specific agricultural knowledge and lack support
for interactive, language-based understanding. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) have opened new
avenues for multimodal reasoning. However, their performance in agricultural
contexts remains limited due to the absence of specialized datasets and
insufficient domain adaptation. In this work, we propose AgriDoctor, a modular
and extensible multimodal framework designed for intelligent crop disease
diagnosis and agricultural knowledge interaction. As a pioneering effort to
introduce agent-based multimodal reasoning into the agricultural domain,
AgriDoctor offers a novel paradigm for building interactive and domain-adaptive
crop health solutions. It integrates five core components: a router,
classifier, detector, knowledge retriever and LLMs. To facilitate effective
training and evaluation, we construct AgriMM, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 400000 annotated disease images, 831 expert-curated knowledge
entries, and 300000 bilingual prompts for intent-driven tool selection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AgriDoctor, trained on AgriMM,
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LVLMs on fine-grained agricultural
tasks, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent and sustainable farming
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在细粒度图像哈希任务中展现出潜力，尤其在低比特哈希码场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Fine-grained hashing has become a powerful solution for rapid and efficient
image retrieval, particularly in scenarios requiring high discrimination
between visually similar categories. To enable each hash bit to correspond to
specific visual attributes, we propoe a novel method that harnesses learnable
queries for attribute-aware hash codes learning. This method deploys a tailored
set of queries to capture and represent nuanced attribute-level information
within the hashing process, thereby enhancing both the interpretability and
relevance of each hash bit. Building on this query-based optimization
framework, we incorporate an auxiliary branch to help alleviate the challenges
of complex landscape optimization often encountered with low-bit hash codes.
This auxiliary branch models high-order attribute interactions, reinforcing the
robustness and specificity of the generated hash codes. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generates attribute-aware hash

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非线性流形几何的原型识别方法GeoProto，显著优于欧几里得原型网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧几里得距离在深度视觉特征中难以捕捉真实相似性，尤其在细粒度识别中语义差异细微时更为明显。

Method: 通过扩散空间提取类别的潜在流形结构，并引入可微Nyström插值，使几何结构对未见样本和可学习原型均可用。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和Stanford Cars数据集上，GeoProto生成的语义对齐原型显著优于欧几里得原型网络。

Conclusion: GeoProto通过利用深度特征的几何结构，提升了原型识别的性能。

Abstract: Nonlinear manifolds are widespread in deep visual features, where Euclidean
distances often fail to capture true similarity. This limitation becomes
particularly severe in prototype-based interpretable fine-grained recognition,
where subtle semantic distinctions are essential. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel paradigm for prototype-based recognition that anchors
similarity within the intrinsic geometry of deep features. Specifically, we
distill the latent manifold structure of each class into a diffusion space and
introduce a differentiable Nystr\"om interpolation, making the geometry
accessible to both unseen samples and learnable prototypes. To ensure
efficiency, we employ compact per-class landmark sets with periodic updates.
This design keeps the embedding aligned with the evolving backbone, enabling
fast and scalable inference. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and
Stanford Cars datasets show that our GeoProto framework produces prototypes
focusing on semantically aligned parts, significantly outperforming Euclidean
prototype networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardiacCLIP是一种基于视频的框架，通过注意力机制和多分辨率输入提升LVEF预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模标注数据集且无法捕捉关键时间动态和局部结构，限制了临床适应性。

Method: 提出MFL（多帧学习）和EchoZoom策略，结合注意力机制和多尺度特征提取。

Result: 在EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上，1-shot设置下MAE降低2.07。

Conclusion: CardiacCLIP显著提升了诊断准确性，适用于少样本超声心动图视频分析。

Abstract: Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment,
with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of
heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale
annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across
various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography,
such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial
temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate
diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based
framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame
aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL
(Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively
fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction
strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel
adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our
approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on
the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息约束的文本引导视觉可供性学习框架，通过最大化图像特征与文本提示之间的互信息，提升可供性区域的识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉图像与语言描述之间的特征对齐，导致可供性学习效果不佳。

Result: 在AGD20K数据集上实现了单样本可供性学习的最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过信息约束实现文本-图像特征对齐，显著提升了可供性学习的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual affordance learning is crucial for robots to understand and interact
effectively with the physical world. Recent advances in this field attempt to
leverage pre-trained knowledge of vision-language foundation models to learn
affordance properties with limited training data, providing a novel paradigm
for visual affordance learning. However, these methods overlook the
significance of maintaining feature alignment between visual images and
language descriptions for identifying affordance areas with textual guidance,
and thus may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we present an
informative framework for text-guided affordance learning, which involves
information-based constraints to achieve text-image alignment at feature level.
Specifically, we design an affordance mutual information constraint that helps
learn appropriate textual prompts and task-oriented visual features
simultaneously by maximizing the mutual information between the features of the
affordance areas in the input images and the corresponding textual prompts. In
addition, we propose an object-level information constraint that maximizes the
mutual information between the visual features of a given object and the text
features of the category it belongs to. This enables the model to capture
high-quality representations for the object, providing more reliable semantic
priors for identifying affordance regions. Experimental results on the AGD20K
dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and
achieves the new state-of-the-art in one-shot affordance learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出三种增强策略（图像分辨率调整、数据增强和注意力机制）以提升YOLOv8在检测小物体时的性能，并设计了MoonNet管道，结合SE Block和CBAM模块，显著提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YOLOv8等单阶段检测器在检测小物体时性能不足，尤其是在低分辨率目标和复杂背景的航空影像中。

Method: 通过调整输入图像分辨率、数据增强和引入注意力机制（SE Block和CBAM）改进YOLOv8，并设计MoonNet管道。

Result: MoonNet在YOLOv8基础上显著提升了检测精度，并在小物体基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MoonNet展示了在小物体检测中的潜力，尤其是与YOLC模型结合时表现优异。

Abstract: While one-stage detectors like YOLOv8 offer fast training speed, they often
under-perform on detecting small objects as a trade-off. This becomes even more
critical when detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery due to low-resolution
targets and cluttered backgrounds. To address this, we introduce three
enhancement strategies -- input image resolution adjustment, data augmentation,
and attention mechanisms -- that can be easily implemented on YOLOv8. We
demonstrate that image size enlargement and the proper use of augmentation can
lead to enhancement. Additionally, we designed a Mixture of Orthogonal
Neural-modules Network (MoonNet) pipeline which consists of attention-augmented
CNNs. Two well-known attention modules, the Squeeze-and-Excitation Block (SE
Block) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), were integrated
into the backbone of YOLOv8 with an increased number of channels, and the
MoonNet backbone obtained improved detection accuracy compared to the original
YOLOv8. MoonNet further proved its adaptability and potential by achieving
state-of-the-art performance on a tiny-object benchmark when integrated with
the YOLC model. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Kihyun11/MoonNet

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双调制框架（Dual Modulation Framework），通过空间调制注意力（SMA）和自适应融合调制（AFM）提升RGB-Thermal人群计数的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer方法在RGB-Thermal人群计数中因缺乏空间归纳偏置导致的注意力分散问题，以及跨模态融合的挑战。

Method: 使用SMA模块通过空间衰减掩码限制注意力范围，AFM模块通过动态门控机制自适应融合多模态信息。

Result: 在RGB-Thermal人群计数数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双调制框架有效提升了人群定位精度和跨模态融合效果。

Abstract: Accurate RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) crowd counting is crucial for public safety in
challenging conditions. While recent Transformer-based methods excel at
capturing global context, their inherent lack of spatial inductive bias causes
attention to spread to irrelevant background regions, compromising crowd
localization precision. Furthermore, effectively bridging the gap between these
distinct modalities remains a major hurdle. To tackle this, we propose the Dual
Modulation Framework, comprising two modules: Spatially Modulated Attention
(SMA), which improves crowd localization by using a learnable Spatial Decay
Mask to penalize attention between distant tokens and prevent focus from
spreading to the background; and Adaptive Fusion Modulation (AFM), which
implements a dynamic gating mechanism to prioritize the most reliable modality
for adaptive cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments on RGB-T crowd counting
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to
previous works. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS因依赖高斯参数导致的内存开销大和细节重建不足问题。

Method: HyRF分解场景为显式高斯和网格神经场，采用解耦神经场架构和混合渲染方案。

Result: HyRF在保持实时性能的同时，模型大小减少20倍以上，渲染质量达到SOTA。

Conclusion: HyRF通过结合显式和隐式表示，有效平衡了内存开销和渲染质量。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative
to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis
through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from
significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to
model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose
compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture
high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded
reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a
novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians
and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit
Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based
neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational
capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately
modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color.
Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian
splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in
distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times
compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance. Our project page is

Motivation: 现有视频动作识别模型计算成本高且依赖大量预训练，而CLIP和运动向量分别提供了强大的静态图像和高效动态信息，但尚未有效结合。

Method: 采用两流框架，结合冻结的CLIP图像编码器和轻量级运动向量网络，仅训练一个MLP头进行特征融合。

Conclusion: MoCLIP-Lite为视频理解提供了高效的新基准，成功结合了静态模型和低成本动态线索的优势。

Abstract: Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but
state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on
extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models
like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot
capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly
efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To
synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple
yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition.
Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features
from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both
backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is
trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the
UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy,
significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%)
baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video
understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and
dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at

TL;DR: AlignedGen是一个无需训练的框架，通过Shifted Position Embedding和Advanced Attention Sharing技术，提升DiT模型生成图像的风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在相同风格提示下生成的图像风格一致性不足，限制了其在创意工作流程中的应用。现有方法局限于U-Net架构，效果不佳且不兼容DiT。

Method: 提出ShiftPE解决位置嵌入冲突，开发AAS技术优化注意力共享，并设计特征提取算法支持外部风格参考。

Result: 实验证明AlignedGen显著提升风格一致性，同时保持文本到图像的精确对齐。

Conclusion: AlignedGen为DiT模型提供了一种高效且兼容的解决方案，解决了风格一致性问题。

Abstract: Despite their generative power, diffusion models struggle to maintain style
consistency across images conditioned on the same style prompt, hindering their
practical deployment in creative workflows. While several training-free methods
attempt to solve this, they are constrained to the U-Net architecture, which
not only leads to low-quality results and artifacts like object repetition but
also renders them incompatible with superior Diffusion Transformer (DiT). To
address these issues, we introduce AlignedGen, a novel training-free framework
that enhances style consistency across images generated by DiT models. Our work
first reveals a critical insight: naive attention sharing fails in DiT due to
conflicting positional signals from improper position embeddings. We introduce
Shifted Position Embedding (ShiftPE), an effective solution that resolves this
conflict by allocating a non-overlapping set of positional indices to each
image. Building on this foundation, we develop Advanced Attention Sharing
(AAS), a suite of three techniques meticulously designed to fully unleash the
potential of attention sharing within the DiT. Furthermore, to broaden the
applicability of our method, we present an efficient query, key, and value
feature extraction algorithm, enabling our method to seamlessly incorporate
external images as style references. Extensive experimental results validate
that our method effectively enhances style consistency across generated images
while maintaining precise text-to-image alignment.

Result: 在OOD场景中表现优异，显著提升不确定性估计的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分割性能和不确定性估计方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation
as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches.
However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty
estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions.
In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of
uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the
relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries
and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are
designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and
human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for
evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed
method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the
interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation. Code is available

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for surgical quality assessment
promise to democratize access to expertise, with applications in training,
guidance, and accreditation. This study presents the SAGES Critical View of
Safety (CVS) Challenge, the first AI competition organized by a surgical
society, using the CVS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a universally
recommended yet inconsistently performed safety step, as an exemplar of
surgical quality assessment. A global collaboration across 54 institutions in
24 countries engaged hundreds of clinicians and engineers to curate 1,000
videos annotated by 20 surgical experts according to a consensus-validated
protocol. The challenge addressed key barriers to real-world deployment in
surgery, including achieving high performance, capturing uncertainty in
subjective assessment, and ensuring robustness to clinical variability. To
enable this scale of effort, we developed EndoGlacier, a framework for managing
large, heterogeneous surgical video and multi-annotator workflows. Thirteen
international teams participated, achieving up to a 17\% relative gain in
assessment performance, over 80\% reduction in calibration error, and a 17\%

Result: Stencil在不到一分钟内生成高质量、主题一致的新图像，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Stencil在主题驱动生成中设定了新基准，平衡了效率与质量。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models can generate striking visuals from text
prompts, but they often fail to maintain subject consistency across generations
and contexts. One major limitation of current fine-tuning approaches is the
inherent trade-off between quality and efficiency. Fine-tuning large models
improves fidelity but is computationally expensive, while fine-tuning
lightweight models improves efficiency but compromises image fidelity.
Moreover, fine-tuning pre-trained models on a small set of images of the
subject can damage the existing priors, resulting in suboptimal results. To
this end, we present Stencil, a novel framework that jointly employs two
diffusion models during inference. Stencil efficiently fine-tunes a lightweight
model on images of the subject, while a large frozen pre-trained model provides
contextual guidance during inference, injecting rich priors to enhance
generation with minimal overhead. Stencil excels at generating high-fidelity,
novel renditions of the subject in less than a minute, delivering
state-of-the-art performance and setting a new benchmark in subject-driven
generation.

Abstract: Industrial vision inspection requires high accuracy under stringent resource

LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive
computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases.
In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative

detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically
balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，MD-Net达到Pearson相关系数0.9235，表现最优。

Conclusion: MD-Net展示了生成模型与序列模型结合的潜力，适用于复杂视觉评估任务。

Abstract: The automated prediction of facial beauty is a benchmark task in affective
computing that requires a sophisticated understanding of both local aesthetic
details (e.g., skin texture) and global facial harmony (e.g., symmetry,
proportions). Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases
that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but
struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at
a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the
\textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture
that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to
state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from
a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for
fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba
(Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial
structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these
complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net
creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the
SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson
Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of
hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for
complex visual assessment tasks.

Conclusion: Echo-Path能有效生成高质量病理超声视频，提升诊断模型性能。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality
globally, and echocardiography is critical for diagnosis of both common and
congenital cardiac conditions. However, echocardiographic data for certain
pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis
models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to
produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies.
Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit
targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a
pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator,
allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion
patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic
videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity.
Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers.
Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real
data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream
diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively. Code, weights and dataset
are available here https://github.com/Marshall-mk/EchoPathv1

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在文化遗产分析中缺乏领域专业知识和SFT容易过拟合的问题，提升对古希腊陶器的专家级推理能力。

Method: 构建问题类型分类法，通过SFT模型定位性能差距，并利用类型条件和组合性导向的奖励进行优化。

Result: 在风格分类和历史归属任务中取得先进成果，组合鲁棒性显著优于仅SFT的基线。

Conclusion: VaseVL通过诊断引导和分类法条件奖励工程，为未来研究提供了可复用的资源。

Abstract: Analyzing cultural-heritage artifacts remains challenging for MLLMs: general
models lack domain expertise, and SFT often overfits superficial patterns,
yielding brittle reasoning for authentication and historical attribution. This
raises the question of how to equip MLLMs with robust, expert-level reasoning
for ancient Greek pottery. We present VaseVL, an SFT-then-RL system that turns
evaluation into supervision: we construct a taxonomy of question types, probe
the SFT model to localize type-specific performance gaps, and optimize with
type-conditioned, compositionality-oriented rewards targeting those gaps. We
also release VaseVQA, a comprehensive benchmark of 31,773 images designed to
probe deep understanding. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on style
classification and historical attribution with marked gains in compositional
robustness over SFT-only baselines, validating diagnosis-guided,
taxonomy-conditioned reward engineering and providing a reusable resource for
future research. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散的框架，直接在生成过程中嵌入每点语义条件，联合合成几何和语义，生成结构连贯且分割感知的点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法主要关注几何，语义通常通过外部分割或聚类后处理，而非集成到生成过程中。

Method: 采用扩散模型，为每个点关联语义标签的条件变量，指导扩散动态，实现几何和语义的联合合成。

Result: 生成的点云结构连贯且分割感知，实验验证了方法的有效性，生成详细且准确的3D点云。

Conclusion: 条件变量对扩散动态和生成质量有显著影响，提出的方法在生成语义感知点云方面表现优异。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer
vision with applications in remote sensing, robotics, and digital object
modeling. Existing generative approaches primarily capture geometry, and when
semantics are considered, they are typically imposed post hoc through external
segmentation or clustering rather than integrated into the generative process
itself. We propose a diffusion-based framework that embeds per-point semantic
conditioning directly within generation. Each point is associated with a
conditional variable corresponding to its semantic label, which guides the
diffusion dynamics and enables the joint synthesis of geometry and semantics.
This design produces point clouds that are both structurally coherent and
segmentation-aware, with object parts explicitly represented during synthesis.
Through a comparative analysis of guided and unguided diffusion processes, we
demonstrate the significant impact of conditional variables on diffusion
dynamics and generation quality. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our approach, producing detailed and accurate 3D point clouds tailored to
specific parts and features.

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上重建误差降低93%，收敛更快，分类准确率更高。

Conclusion: Point-RTD在性能和效率上均显著优于基线方法Point-MAE。

Abstract: Pre-training strategies play a critical role in advancing the performance of
transformer-based models for 3D point cloud tasks. In this paper, we introduce
Point-RTD (Replaced Token Denoising), a novel pretraining strategy designed to
improve token robustness through a corruption-reconstruction framework. Unlike
traditional mask-based reconstruction tasks that hide data segments for later
prediction, Point-RTD corrupts point cloud tokens and leverages a
discriminator-generator architecture for denoising. This shift enables more
effective learning of structural priors and significantly enhances model
performance and efficiency. On the ShapeNet dataset, Point-RTD reduces
reconstruction error by over 93% compared to PointMAE, and achieves more than
14x lower Chamfer Distance on the test set. Our method also converges faster
and yields higher classification accuracy on ShapeNet, ModelNet10, and
ModelNet40 benchmarks, clearly outperforming the baseline Point-MAE framework
in every case.

Abstract: This paper presents MirrorSAM2, the first framework that adapts Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to the task of RGB-D video mirror segmentation.
MirrorSAM2 addresses key challenges in mirror detection, such as reflection
ambiguity and texture confusion, by introducing four tailored modules: a Depth

Prompt Generator for automatic prompt generation, a Frequency Detail Attention
Fusion Module to enhance structural boundaries, and a Mirror Mask Decoder with

Abstract: This paper proposes a Diffusion Model-Optimized Neural Radiance Field
(DT-NeRF) method, aimed at enhancing detail recovery and multi-view consistency
in 3D scene reconstruction. By combining diffusion models with Transformers,
DT-NeRF effectively restores details under sparse viewpoints and maintains high
accuracy in complex geometric scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that
DT-NeRF significantly outperforms traditional NeRF and other state-of-the-art
methods on the Matterport3D and ShapeNet datasets, particularly in metrics such
as PSNR, SSIM, Chamfer Distance, and Fidelity. Ablation experiments further
confirm the critical role of the diffusion and Transformer modules in the
model's performance, with the removal of either module leading to a decline in
performance. The design of DT-NeRF showcases the synergistic effect between
modules, providing an efficient and accurate solution for 3D scene

Result: 在无姿态监督下，实现了领域内外新视角合成的SOTA性能，且适应极端视角变化和有限图像重叠。

Conclusion: SPFSplatV2摆脱了对真实姿态的依赖，具有更强的几何约束和数据集扩展潜力。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplatV2, an efficient feed-forward framework for 3D Gaussian
splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during
training and inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone,
enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in
a canonical space from unposed inputs. A masked attention mechanism is
introduced to efficiently estimate target poses during training, while a
reprojection loss enforces pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives, providing
stronger geometric constraints. We further demonstrate the compatibility of our
training framework with different reconstruction architectures, resulting in
two model variants. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and
out-of-domain novel view synthesis, even under extreme viewpoint changes and
limited image overlap, and surpasses recent methods that rely on geometric
supervision for relative pose estimation. By eliminating dependence on
ground-truth poses, our method offers the scalability to leverage larger and
more diverse datasets. Code and pretrained models will be available on our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情识别任务中，有损压缩导致特征退化和准确率下降的问题。

Method: 引入定制损失函数优化模型，研究不同损失项权重对性能平衡的影响。

Result: 单独优化压缩模型提升分类准确率0.71%和压缩效率49.32%，联合优化分别提升4.04%和89.12%。

Conclusion: 联合优化模型在压缩和非压缩数据上均保持高准确率，且压缩模型在高压缩率下仍能保留图像细节。

Abstract: Efficient data compression is crucial for the storage and transmission of
visual data. However, in facial expression recognition (FER) tasks, lossy
compression often leads to feature degradation and reduced accuracy. To address
these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end model designed to preserve
critical features and enhance both compression and recognition performance. A
custom loss function is introduced to optimize the model, tailored to balance
compression and recognition performance effectively. This study also examines
the influence of varying loss term weights on this balance. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning the compression model alone improves
classification accuracy by 0.71% and compression efficiency by 49.32%, while
joint optimization achieves significant gains of 4.04% in accuracy and 89.12%
in efficiency. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the jointly optimized
classification model maintains high accuracy on both compressed and
uncompressed data, while the compression model reliably preserves image
details, even at high compression rates.

Conclusion: 该工作通过优化动态环境中实时性和保真度的权衡，推动了实时3D场景表示的发展。

Abstract: Real-time Three-dimensional (3D) scene representation is a foundational
element that supports a broad spectrum of cutting-edge applications, including
digital manufacturing, Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR), and
the emerging metaverse. Despite advancements in real-time communication and
computing, achieving a balance between timeliness and fidelity in 3D scene
representation remains a challenge. This work investigates a wireless network
where multiple homogeneous mobile robots, equipped with cameras, capture an
environment and transmit images to an edge server over channels for 3D
representation. We propose a contextual-bandit Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) framework incorporating both Age of Information (AoI) and semantic
information to optimize image selection for representation, balancing data
freshness and representation quality. Two policies -- the $\omega$-threshold
and $\omega$-wait policies -- together with two benchmark methods are
evaluated, timeliness embedding and weighted sum, on standard datasets and
baseline 3D scene representation models. Experimental results demonstrate
improved representation fidelity while maintaining low latency, offering
insight into the model's decision-making process. This work advances real-time
3D scene representation by optimizing the trade-off between timeliness and
fidelity in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为BCC中的自动化设施枚举提供了新思路，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that
constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is
the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution.
Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the
literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap
in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with
reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC:
automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each
facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel
method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the
first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse
datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor
plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

Conclusion: UIPro通过统一动作空间和大规模数据训练，有效提升了GUI代理的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents that perceive and operate graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) like humans has long been a vision in the field of artificial
intelligence. Central to these agents is the capability for GUI interaction,
which involves GUI understanding and planning capabilities. Existing methods
have tried developing GUI agents based on the multi-modal comprehension ability
of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the limited scenario, insufficient
size, and heterogeneous action spaces hinder the progress of building
generalist GUI agents. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes
\textbf{UIPro}, a novel generalist GUI agent trained with extensive
multi-platform and multi-task GUI interaction data, coupled with a unified
action space. We first curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing 20.6 million
GUI understanding tasks to pre-train UIPro, granting it a strong GUI grounding
capability, which is key to downstream GUI agent tasks. Subsequently, we
establish a unified action space to harmonize heterogeneous GUI agent task
datasets and produce a merged dataset to foster the action prediction ability
of UIPro via continued fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate UIPro's
superior performance across multiple GUI task benchmarks on various platforms,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的烟雾会严重降低图像质量并阻碍可见性，现有方法要么依赖易产生幻觉的数据驱动先验，要么仅限于静态低密度烟雾。

Method: 利用热成像和RGB图像，基于3D高斯泼溅技术融合两种模态信息，将场景明确分解为烟雾和非烟雾成分。

Result: SmokeSeer能够处理广泛的烟雾密度并适应时间变化的烟雾，在合成数据和真实世界多视角烟雾数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SmokeSeer提供了一种高效且适应性强的烟雾去除和场景重建方法，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: Smoke in real-world scenes can severely degrade the quality of images and
hamper visibility. Recent methods for image restoration either rely on
data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to
static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D
scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of
a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the
reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We
build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image
modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke
components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke
densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach
on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB
and thermal images. We provide open-source code and data at the project
website.

Conclusion: Transformer模型在图像描述任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automatic image captioning, a multifaceted task bridging computer vision and
natural lan- guage processing, aims to generate descriptive textual content
from visual input. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they
present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish
training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information
from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This
project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending
transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention
mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data.
This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference
phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized
for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous
methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing,
construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea-
ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated.
Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient
training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.

Conclusion: 研究为NR-IQA任务提供了高效的基线模型，并揭示了激活函数选择的重要性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision language pre-training has recently shown promise for
no-reference image-quality assessment (NR-IQA), yet the relative merits of
modern Vision Transformer foundations remain poorly understood. In this work,
we present the first systematic evaluation of six prominent pretrained
backbones, CLIP, SigLIP2, DINOv2, DINOv3, Perception, and ResNet, for the task
of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), each finetuned using an
identical lightweight MLP head. Our study uncovers two previously overlooked
factors: (1) SigLIP2 consistently achieves strong performance; and (2) the
choice of activation function plays a surprisingly crucial role, particularly
for enhancing the generalization ability of image quality assessment models.
Notably, we find that simple sigmoid activations outperform commonly used ReLU
and GELU on several benchmarks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a
learnable activation selection mechanism that adaptively determines the
nonlinearity for each channel, eliminating the need for manual activation
design, and achieving new state-of-the-art SRCC on CLIVE, KADID10K, and
AGIQA3K. Extensive ablations confirm the benefits across architectures and
regimes, establishing strong, resource-efficient NR-IQA baselines.

Result: 在公开和自采数据集上表现优于现有方法，首次将扩散模型应用于伪距误差估计。

Conclusion: Diff-GNSS模块即插即用，可显著提升现有网络的估计精度。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are vital for reliable urban
positioning. However, multipath and non-line-of-sight reception often introduce
large measurement errors that degrade accuracy. Learning-based methods for
predicting and compensating pseudorange errors have gained traction, but their
performance is limited by complex error distributions. To address this
challenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement
(pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion
model to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module
performs coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate
scale and trend. Then, a conditional denoising diffusion layer refines the
estimate, enabling fine-grained modeling of pseudorange errors. To suppress
uncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key
features related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to
precisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate
per-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the
reliability of the predicted errors. We have collected and publicly released a
real-world dataset covering various scenes. Experiments on public and
self-collected datasets show that DiffGNSS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to pseudorange
error estimation. The proposed diffusion-based refinement module is
plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing networks to markedly
improve estimation accuracy.

Abstract: How do vision transformers (ViTs) represent and process the world? This paper
addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of
6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by
introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations
with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not
only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but
also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature
types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet
parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly
simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables
intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility
of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.

Conclusion: YOLOv10-nano适用于数据有限环境中的高效、可扩展的海洋鱼类监测和保护应用。

Abstract: Indonesia's marine ecosystems, part of the globally recognized Coral
Triangle, are among the richest in biodiversity, requiring efficient monitoring
tools to support conservation. Traditional fish detection methods are
time-consuming and demand expert knowledge, prompting the need for automated
solutions. This study explores the implementation of YOLOv10-nano, a
state-of-the-art deep learning model, for real-time marine fish detection in
Indonesian waters, using test data from Bunaken National Marine Park. YOLOv10's
architecture, featuring improvements like the CSPNet backbone, PAN for feature
fusion, and Pyramid Spatial Attention Block, enables efficient and accurate
object detection even in complex environments. The model was evaluated on the
DeepFish and OpenImages V7-Fish datasets. Results show that YOLOv10-nano
achieves a high detection accuracy with mAP50 of 0.966 and mAP50:95 of 0.606
while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It
also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it
suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided
lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness.
Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient,
scalable marine fish monitoring and conservation applications in data-limited
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习扩散先验的单次快照离焦深度重建方法，取代传统手工先验，通过优化框架实现更高精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离焦深度重建方法依赖手工先验，而U-Net风格方法需要配对训练数据且受限于特定相机配置。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合可微分前向模型和扩散先验作为正则化，在去噪图像域中引导解，无需配对训练数据或特定相机配置。

Result: 在仿真和原型相机实验中，该方法在噪声水平下均表现优异，优于U-Net基线和传统编码孔径离焦深度方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习扩散先验和优化框架，实现了高精度和稳定性的离焦深度重建，且更具通用性。

Abstract: We propose a single-snapshot depth-from-defocus (DFD) reconstruction method
for coded-aperture imaging that replaces hand-crafted priors with a learned
diffusion prior used purely as regularization. Our optimization framework
enforces measurement consistency via a differentiable forward model while
guiding solutions with the diffusion prior in the denoised image domain,
yielding higher accuracy and stability than clas- sical optimization. Unlike
U-Net-style regressors, our approach requires no paired defocus-RGBD training
data and does not tie training to a specific camera configuration. Experiments
on comprehensive simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate consistently
strong RGBD reconstructions across noise levels, outperforming both U-Net
baselines and a classical coded- aperture DFD method.

Result: 构建了首个MSTP基准测试，并验证了IG-MC方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IG-MC方法在多尺度时间预测任务中表现出色，平衡了全局一致性和局部保真度。

Abstract: Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene
understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting
multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is
difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal
Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing
multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting
states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state
scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For
example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained
than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps
are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their
encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP
Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and
temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and
Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First,
we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously
synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform
multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals
synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals
lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration
framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and
multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction
cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.

Motivation: 通过结合全局语义特征和多分辨率局部几何特征，解决3D语义对应问题，同时利用预训练的3D生成模型中的先验知识。

Method: 设计了分层神经语义表示（HNSR）和渐进式全局到局部匹配策略，无需训练且兼容多种预训练3D生成模型。

Conclusion: 方法在定性和定量评估中均优于现有技术，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate and robust 3D
semantic correspondence with the hierarchical neural semantic representation.
Our work has three key contributions. First, we design the hierarchical neural
semantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to
capture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to
preserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D
generative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching
strategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global
semantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features,
yielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is
training-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative
backbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories.
Our method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation,
keypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally
diverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios. Both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言基础模型（如CLIP）的无训练标签空间对齐方法，显著提升了通用领域自适应（UniDA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UniDA方法主要关注视觉空间对齐，但容易因内容差异导致视觉模糊性，限制了鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 利用CLIP的零样本能力生成任务特定分类器，通过生成式视觉语言模型识别目标域未知类别，并过滤和优化噪声标签。

Result: 在DomainBed基准测试中，H-score和H³-score分别平均提升7.9%和6.1%，结合自训练后进一步提升1.6%。

Conclusion: 标签空间对齐优于视觉空间对齐，结合自训练可进一步增强性能。

Abstract: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the
target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily
focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities
due to content differences, which limited their robustness and
generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that
leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language
foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space
alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific
classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is
challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this
study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown
categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the
discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms,
hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose
a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method
aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy
labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier}
that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information,
thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that
the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across
key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of
\textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score.
Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and
achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and
H$^3$-scores.

TL;DR: LEAM是一种新的解释性技术，用于识别面部识别系统中最关键的面部区域，为个性化隐私保护提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别系统的普及带来隐私风险，现有对抗技术缺乏个性化适应性，LEAM旨在理解系统工作原理以指导未来隐私保护研究。

Method: LEAM结合面部解析器，分析1000名个体在9个预训练面部识别模型中的数据，识别关键面部区域。

Result: 发现面部识别模型普遍优先关注面部中央区域（如鼻子），且不同模型间关键区域相似，验证了LEAM识别区域的跨模型可迁移性。

Conclusion: LEAM为未来个性化隐私保护系统提供了基础，通过选择关键区域进行干扰。

Abstract: The proliferation of facial recognition systems presents major privacy risks,
driving the need for effective countermeasures. Current adversarial techniques
apply generalized methods rather than adapting to individual facial
characteristics, limiting their effectiveness and inconspicuousness. In this
work, we introduce Layer Embedding Activation Mapping (LEAM), a novel technique
that identifies which facial areas contribute most to recognition at an
individual level. Unlike adversarial attack methods that aim to fool
recognition systems, LEAM is an explainability technique designed to understand
how these systems work, providing insights that could inform future privacy
protection research. We integrate LEAM with a face parser to analyze data from
1000 individuals across 9 pre-trained facial recognition models.
  Our analysis reveals that while different layers within facial recognition
models vary significantly in their focus areas, these models generally
prioritize similar facial regions across architectures when considering their
overall activation patterns, which show significantly higher similarity between
images of the same individual (Bhattacharyya Coefficient: 0.32-0.57) vs.
different individuals (0.04-0.13), validating the existence of person-specific
recognition patterns. Our results show that facial recognition models
prioritize the central region of face images (with nose areas accounting for
18.9-29.7% of critical recognition regions), while still distributing attention
across multiple facial fragments. Proper selection of relevant facial areas was
confirmed using validation occlusions, based on just 1% of the most relevant,
LEAM-identified, image pixels, which proved to be transferable across different
models. Our findings establish the foundation for future individually tailored
privacy protection systems centered around LEAM's choice of areas to be
perturbed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在复杂对象关系、属性和空间排列上的组合对齐问题。

Method: 提出CARINOX框架，结合噪声优化和探索，并基于人类判断选择奖励。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench++和HRS基准上分别提升16%和11%的对齐分数。

Conclusion: CARINOX在保持图像质量和多样性的同时，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

TL;DR: CSDformer是一种新型转换方法，用于构建完全脉冲驱动的Transformer模型，显著降低训练成本和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本或硬件友好性上存在不足，CSDformer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出转换导向的Transformer架构，用NReLU替代softmax，量化训练后通过时间分解技术转换为脉冲模型。

Result: 在ImageNet等数据集上表现优异，训练成本降低75%，速度提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: CSDformer是首个通过转换方法实现的高性能脉冲Transformer模型，显著降低复杂性和训练开销。

Abstract: Spike-based transformer is a novel architecture aiming to enhance the
performance of spiking neural networks while mitigating the energy overhead
inherent to transformers. However, methods for generating these models suffer
from critical limitations: excessive training costs introduced by direct
training methods, or unavoidably hardware-unfriendly operations in existing
conversion methods. In this paper, we propose CSDformer, a novel conversion
method for fully spike-driven transformers. We tailor a conversion-oriented
transformer-based architecture and propose a new function NReLU to replace
softmax in self-attention. Subsequently, this model is quantized and trained,
and converted into a fully spike-driven model with temporal decomposition
technique. Also, we propose delayed Integrate-andFire neurons to reduce
conversion errors and improve the performance of spiking models. We evaluate
CSDformer on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and achieve 76.36% top-1
accuracy under 7 time-steps on ImageNet, demonstrating superiority over
state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, CSDformer eliminates the need for
training SNNs, thereby reducing training costs (reducing computational resource
by 75% and accelerating training speed by 2-3$\times$). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first fully spike-driven transformer-based model
developed via conversion method, achieving high performance under ultra-low
latency, while dramatically reducing both computational complexity and training
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习可能因任务冲突导致性能下降，MAESTRO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MAESTRO包含CPG、TSFG和SPA三个组件，分别生成类原型、任务特定特征和场景原型聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D基准测试中，MAESTRO在多个任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAESTRO有效解决了多任务学习中的特征干扰问题，提升了3D感知任务的性能。

Abstract: The goal of multi-task learning is to learn to conduct multiple tasks
simultaneously based on a shared data representation. While this approach can
improve learning efficiency, it may also cause performance degradation due to
task conflicts that arise when optimizing the model for different objectives.
To address this challenge, we introduce MAESTRO, a structured framework
designed to generate task-specific features and mitigate feature interference
in multi-task 3D perception, including 3D object detection, bird's-eye view
(BEV) map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction. MAESTRO comprises three
components: the Class-wise Prototype Generator (CPG), the Task-Specific Feature
Generator (TSFG), and the Scene Prototype Aggregator (SPA). CPG groups class
categories into foreground and background groups and generates group-wise
prototypes. The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D
object detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both
are assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these
prototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant
features, thereby enhancing the performance for each task. SPA enhances the
prototype groups assigned for 3D occupancy prediction by utilizing the
information produced by the 3D object detection head and the map segmentation
head. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate
that MAESTRO consistently outperforms existing methods across 3D object
detection, BEV map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction tasks.

Result: 模型在时间一致性和表情控制上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在肖像动画中实现了高质量和可控性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to generate photo-realistic videos from a single
source image by reenacting the expression and pose from a driving video. While
early methods relied on 3D morphable models or feature warping techniques, they
often suffered from limited expressivity, temporal inconsistency, and poor
generalization to unseen identities or large pose variations. Recent advances
using diffusion models have demonstrated improved quality but remain
constrained by weak control signals and architectural limitations. In this
work, we propose a novel diffusion based framework that leverages masked facial
regions specifically the eyes, nose, and mouth from the driving video as strong
motion control cues. To enable robust training without appearance leakage, we
adopt cross identity supervision. To leverage the strong prior from the
pretrained diffusion model, our novel architecture introduces minimal new
parameters that converge faster and help in better generalization. We introduce
spatial temporal attention mechanisms that allow inter frame and intra frame
interactions, effectively capturing subtle motions and reducing temporal
artifacts. Our model uses history frames to ensure continuity across segments.
At inference, we propose a novel signal fusion strategy that balances motion
fidelity with identity preservation. Our approach achieves superior temporal
consistency and accurate expression control, enabling high-quality,
controllable portrait animation suitable for real-world applications.

Method: 提出 ChartHal 基准，包含 1,062 个人工验证样本，细粒度分类幻觉场景。

Result: 当前最先进的 LVLMs 在 ChartHal 上表现不佳，GPT-5 和 o4-mini 准确率仅为 34.46% 和 22.79%。

Conclusion: 图表中缺失或矛盾信息易引发幻觉，亟需更鲁棒的缓解策略。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress, yet hallucination remains a critical barrier, particularly in chart
understanding, which requires sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities
as well as rigorous factual accuracy. While prior work has investigated
hallucinations and chart comprehension independently, their intersection
remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a
benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in
chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our
evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations
on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which
achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals
that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are
especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust mitigation strategies. Code and data are available at

Abstract: Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but
computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with
modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve
the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a
novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised
medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning
pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By
treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement
a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature
representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal
fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract
features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder
for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for
multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and
overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive
experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and
Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods. The
code will be released at: https://github.com/LQH89757/MICS.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a critical factor in road accidents, accounting for
thousands of fatalities and injuries each year. This paper presents a
comprehensive evaluation of real-time, non-intrusive drowsiness detection
methods, focusing on computer vision based YOLO (You Look Only Once)
algorithms. A publicly available dataset namely, UTA-RLDD was used, containing
both awake and drowsy conditions, ensuring variability in gender, eyewear,
illumination, and skin tone. Seven YOLO variants (v5s, v9c, v9t, v10n, v10l,
v11n, v11l) are fine-tuned, with performance measured in terms of Precision,
Recall, mAP0.5, and mAP 0.5-0.95. Among these, YOLOv9c achieved the highest
accuracy (0.986 mAP 0.5, 0.978 Recall) while YOLOv11n strikes the optimal
balance between precision (0.954) and inference efficiency, making it highly
suitable for embedded deployment. Additionally, we implement an Eye Aspect
Ratio (EAR) approach using Dlib's facial landmarks, which despite its low
computational footprint exhibits reduced robustness under pose variation and
occlusions. Our findings illustrate clear trade offs between accuracy, latency,
and resource requirements, and offer practical guidelines for selecting or

Abstract: Large-scale Video Object Segmentation (LSVOS) addresses the challenge of
accurately tracking and segmenting objects in long video sequences, where
difficulties stem from object reappearance, small-scale targets, heavy

SAM2-based frameworks with various memory mechanisms for complex video mask

Strengthened Object Navigation (SAMSON), the 3rd place solution in the MOSE
track of ICCV 2025, which integrates the strengths of stateof-the-art VOS
models into an effective paradigm. To handle visually similar instances and
long-term object disappearance in MOSE, we incorporate a long-term memorymodule
for reliable object re-identification. Additionly, we adopt SAM2Long as a
post-processing strategy to reduce error accumulation and enhance segmentation
stability in long video sequences. Our method achieved a final performance of
0.8427 in terms of J &F in the test-set leaderboard.

Abstract: Volumetric video has emerged as a key medium for immersive telepresence and
augmented/virtual reality, enabling six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) navigation
and realistic spatial interactions. However, delivering high-quality dynamic
volumetric content at scale remains challenging due to massive data volume,
complex motion, and limited editability of existing representations. In this
paper, we present 4D-MoDe, a motion-decoupled 4D Gaussian compression framework
designed for scalable and editable volumetric video streaming. Our method
introduces a layered representation that explicitly separates static
backgrounds from dynamic foregrounds using a lookahead-based motion
decomposition strategy, significantly reducing temporal redundancy and enabling
selective background/foreground streaming. To capture continuous motion
trajectories, we employ a multi-resolution motion estimation grid and a
lightweight shared MLP, complemented by a dynamic Gaussian compensation
mechanism to model emergent content. An adaptive grouping scheme dynamically
inserts background keyframes to balance temporal consistency and compression
efficiency. Furthermore, an entropy-aware training pipeline jointly optimizes
the motion fields and Gaussian parameters under a rate-distortion (RD)
objective, while employing range-based and KD-tree compression to minimize
storage overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that
4D-MoDe consistently achieves competitive reconstruction quality with an order
of magnitude lower storage cost (e.g., as low as \textbf{11.4} KB/frame)
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting practical applications
such as background replacement and foreground-only streaming.

Motivation: 现有体积视频压缩方法无法在单一模型中灵活调整质量和比特率，或在轻量移动平台上实现实时解码和渲染。

Method: 提出感知加权和压缩友好的分层4D高斯表示，结合运动感知自适应分组减少冗余，并通过端到端熵优化训练方案生成高效比特流。

Conclusion: 4DGCPro解决了体积视频压缩的灵活性和实时性问题，为高质量体积视频流提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving seamless viewing of high-fidelity volumetric video, comparable to
2D video experiences, remains an open challenge. Existing volumetric video
compression methods either lack the flexibility to adjust quality and bitrate
within a single model for efficient streaming across diverse networks and
devices, or struggle with real-time decoding and rendering on lightweight
mobile platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce 4DGCPro, a novel
hierarchical 4D Gaussian compression framework that facilitates real-time
mobile decoding and high-quality rendering via progressive volumetric video
streaming in a single bitstream. Specifically, we propose a
perceptually-weighted and compression-friendly hierarchical 4D Gaussian
representation with motion-aware adaptive grouping to reduce temporal
redundancy, preserve coherence, and enable scalable multi-level detail
streaming. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end entropy-optimized training
scheme, which incorporates layer-wise rate-distortion (RD) supervision and
attribute-specific entropy modeling for efficient bitstream generation.
Extensive experiments show that 4DGCPro enables flexible quality and multiple
bitrate within a single model, achieving real-time decoding and rendering on
mobile devices while outperforming existing methods in RD performance across
multiple datasets. Project Page: https://mediax-sjtu.github.io/4DGCPro

Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割面临组织异质性、边界模糊和MRI序列对比度变化等挑战，现有方法在边界划分和层次保持上表现不稳定。

Method: UMCF方法在统一3D潜在空间中同步融合多模态信息，通过无参数不确定性门控调整模态贡献，并直接引入医学先验知识参与注意力计算。

Result: 在BraTS 2020和2021数据集上，UMCF+nnU-Net的平均Dice系数分别达到0.8579和0.8977，主流架构平均提升4.18%。

Conclusion: UMCF通过深度融合临床知识与影像特征，为精准医学中的多模态信息融合提供了新技术路径。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation requires accurate identification of hierarchical
regions including whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET)
from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Due to tumor
tissue heterogeneity, ambiguous boundaries, and contrast variations across MRI
sequences, methods relying solely on visual information or post-hoc loss
constraints show unstable performance in boundary delineation and hierarchy
preservation. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Multimodal
Coherent Field (UMCF) method. This method achieves synchronous interactive
fusion of visual, semantic, and spatial information within a unified 3D latent
space, adaptively adjusting modal contributions through parameter-free
uncertainty gating, with medical prior knowledge directly participating in
attention computation, avoiding the traditional "process-then-concatenate"
separated architecture. On Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 and 2021
datasets, UMCF+nnU-Net achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8579 and 0.8977
respectively, with an average 4.18% improvement across mainstream
architectures. By deeply integrating clinical knowledge with imaging features,
UMCF provides a new technical pathway for multimodal information fusion in
precision medicine.

TL;DR: Chat-CBM通过语言模型增强概念瓶颈模型，提升预测性能和用户交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CBMs的线性分类器限制了用户干预方式，无法动态调整概念或引入外部知识。

Result: 在九个数据集上表现更优，显著提升用户交互性。

Conclusion: Chat-CBM在保持可解释性的同时，扩展了干预方式并提高了性能。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide inherent interpretability by first
predicting a set of human-understandable concepts and then mapping them to
labels through a simple classifier. While users can intervene in the concept
space to improve predictions, traditional CBMs typically employ a fixed linear
classifier over concept scores, which restricts interventions to manual value
adjustments and prevents the incorporation of new concepts or domain knowledge
at test time. These limitations are particularly severe in unsupervised CBMs,
where concept activations are often noisy and densely activated, making user
interventions ineffective. We introduce Chat-CBM, which replaces score-based
classifiers with a language-based classifier that reasons directly over concept
semantics. By grounding prediction in the semantic space of concepts, Chat-CBM
preserves the interpretability of CBMs while enabling richer and more intuitive
interventions, such as concept correction, addition or removal of concepts,
incorporation of external knowledge, and high-level reasoning guidance.
Leveraging the language understanding and few-shot capabilities of frozen large
language models, Chat-CBM extends the intervention interface of CBMs beyond
numerical editing and remains effective even in unsupervised settings.
Experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that Chat-CBM achieves higher
predictive performance and substantially improves user interactivity while
maintaining the concept-based interpretability of CBMs.

Conclusion: SimToken框架有效解决了多模态对象分割问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment specific
objects in videos based on natural language expressions involving audio,
vision, and text information. This task poses significant challenges in
cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we
propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided
to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This
compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts
as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further
improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic
alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but
referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing
methods.Code will be available at https://github.com/DianJin-HFUT/SimToken

Motivation: 水下物体检测因环境失真而具有挑战性，但YOLO模型在此环境中的鲁棒性尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用统一数据集评估YOLOv8-YOLOv12在六种模拟水下环境中的性能，分析失真对特征的影响，并提出轻量级训练策略。

Result: YOLOv12整体表现最佳但易受噪声干扰；噪声破坏边缘和纹理特征；类不平衡影响检测性能；提出的训练策略有效提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究为构建鲁棒且高效的水下物体检测系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) remains a critical challenge in computer
vision due to underwater distortions which degrade low-level features and
compromise the reliability of even state-of-the-art detectors. While YOLO
models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has
systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging
conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust
when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater
environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive
evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated
underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images
from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also
analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges,
and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall
performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and
texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images.
Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3)
image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance,
while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we
evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection,
which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and
fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced
domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong
potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide
practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和模型为PRNU相机识别提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel benchmark for camera identification via Photo Response
Non-Uniformity (PRNU) estimation. The benchmark comprises 13K photos taken with
120+ cameras, where the training and test photos are taken in different
scenarios, enabling ``in-the-wild'' evaluation. In addition, we propose a novel
PRNU-based camera identification model that employs a hybrid architecture,
comprising a denoising autoencoder to estimate the PRNU signal and a
convolutional network that can perform 1:N verification of camera devices.
Instead of using a conventional approach based on contrastive learning, our
method takes the Hadamard product between reference and query PRNU signals as
input. This novel design leads to significantly better results compared with
state-of-the-art models based on denoising autoencoders and contrastive
learning. We release our dataset and code at:

Conclusion: ViTP通过推理增强感知，为下游任务提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception,
reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop
remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the
foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet
underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for
pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual
insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages
reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a
rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains.
ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels
the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of
visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and
medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks. The

Motivation: 理解LVLMs中图像到文本信息传递的机制，因其复杂性而难以解释。

Method: 采用头归因技术，识别在信息传递中起关键作用的注意力头模式。

Result: 发现特定注意力头子集主导信息流，且其选择由输入图像的语义内容而非视觉外观决定。

Conclusion: 图像到文本信息流遵循结构化过程，注意力头分析为理解LVLMs机制提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring
information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this
image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its
underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous
operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose
head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to
identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in
information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on
specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object
in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads
facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the
selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image
rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information
at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to
role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and
(2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens.
Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a
structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a
promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.

Motivation: 解决3D医学影像数据不足和预训练模型适配性问题，提升帕金森病诊断的准确性。

Result: 在300个标注样本上达到86.0%的准确率，比第二名高5.5%。

Conclusion: 2D VFMs在3D MRI临床分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: The automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is in high clinical demand due
to its prevalence and the importance of targeted treatment. Current clinical
practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images.
However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic
models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical
models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to
mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning
data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision
foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and
QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into
a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation
for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices
of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary
segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain
nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning,
which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of
patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes.
Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation
challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled
QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These
results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR
images.

Method: 提出LWinNN，一种基于局部窗口的方法，介于完全平移不变和无平移不变的kNN方法之间。

Result: 实验表明，LWinNN显著提高了准确性，同时减少了训练和测试时间。

Conclusion: LWinNN缩小了kNN方法与复杂方法之间的差距，并揭示了未来研究中对空间多样性基准的需求。

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision
Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due
to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how
to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods
that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive
to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of
related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that
popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this
idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a
middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no
translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change
increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and
test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based
approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed
by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of
requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of
interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks,
for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline. Our code can be
found at https://github.com/marietteschonfeld/LWinNN .

Abstract: Accurate anatomical labeling of intracranial arteries is essential for
cerebrovascular diagnosis and hemodynamic analysis but remains time-consuming
and subject to interoperator variability. We present a deep learning-based
framework for automated artery labeling from 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (3D ToF-MRA) segmentations (n=35), incorporating
uncertainty quantification to enhance interpretability and reliability. We
evaluated three convolutional neural network architectures: (1) a UNet with
residual encoder blocks, reflecting commonly used baselines in vascular
labeling; (2) CS-Net, an attention-augmented UNet incorporating channel and
spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced curvilinear structure recognition;
and (3) nnUNet, a self-configuring framework that automates preprocessing,
training, and architectural adaptation based on dataset characteristics. Among
these, nnUNet achieved the highest labeling performance (average Dice score:
0.922; average surface distance: 0.387 mm), with improved robustness in
anatomically complex vessels. To assess predictive confidence, we implemented
test-time augmentation (TTA) and introduced a novel coordinate-guided strategy
to reduce interpolation errors during augmented inference. The resulting
uncertainty maps reliably indicated regions of anatomical ambiguity,
pathological variation, or manual labeling inconsistency. We further validated
clinical utility by comparing flow velocities derived from automated and manual
labels in co-registered 4D Flow MRI datasets, observing close agreement with no
statistically significant differences. Our framework offers a scalable,
accurate, and uncertainty-aware solution for automated cerebrovascular
labeling, supporting downstream hemodynamic analysis and facilitating clinical
integration.

Abstract: Object detection is essential in space applications targeting Space Domain
Awareness and also applications involving relative navigation scenarios.
Current deep learning models for Object Detection in space applications are
often trained on synthetic data from simulators, however, the model performance
drops significantly on real-world data due to the domain gap. However, domain
adaptive object detection is an overlooked problem in the community. In this
work, we first show the importance of domain adaptation and then explore
Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) to reduce this gap using minimal labeled
real data. We build on a recent semi-supervised adaptation method and tailor it
for object detection. Our approach combines domain-invariant feature learning
with a CNN-based domain discriminator and invariant risk minimization using a
domain-independent regression head. To meet real-time deployment needs, we test
our method on a lightweight Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet
backbone and on the more advanced Fully Convolutional One-Stage object detector
(FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone. We evaluated on two space datasets, SPEED+ and
SPARK. The results show up to 20-point improvements in average precision (AP)

Abstract: Combining multimodal data is a key issue in a wide range of machine learning
tasks, including many remote sensing problems. In Earth observation, early
multimodal data fusion methods were based on specific neural network
architectures and supervised learning. Ever since, the scarcity of labeled data
has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal
representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between
satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area
in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we
investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not
shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when
alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we
support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic
settings. With those theoretical and empirical evidences, we hope to support
new developments in contrastive learning for the combination of multimodal
satellite data. Our code and data is publicly available at

Conclusion: COLA是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多目标域适应，无需共享标签空间。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has gained increasing popularity due to its
efficacy in addressing ``distribution shift'' issue while simultaneously
protecting data privacy.
  However, most prior methods assume that a paired source domain model and
target domain sharing the same label space coexist, heavily limiting their
applicability.
  In this paper, we investigate a more general source model capable of
adaptation to multiple target domains without needing shared labels.
  This is achieved by using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), \egno,
CLIP, that can recognize images through matching with class descriptions.
  While the zero-shot performance of VLMs is impressive, they struggle to
effectively capture the distinctive attributes of a target domain.
  To that end, we propose a novel method -- Context-aware Language-driven TTA
(COLA).
  The proposed method incorporates a lightweight context-aware module that
consists of three key components: a task-aware adapter, a context-aware unit,
and a residual connection unit for exploring task-specific knowledge,
domain-specific knowledge from the VLM and prior knowledge of the VLM,
respectively.
  It is worth noting that the context-aware module can be seamlessly integrated

TL;DR: PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛利用AI加速生态研究中的植物物种识别，通过多标签分类任务评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态研究中，标准化的样方图像对植物多样性评估和长期监测至关重要，AI可帮助加速物种识别并扩大研究范围。

Method: 挑战赛提供2105张高分辨率多标签图像和140万张单标签训练图像，采用视觉Transformer模型进行多标签分类。

Result: 参与者使用不同方法和模型完成任务，结果展示了AI在植物物种识别中的潜力。

Conclusion: PlantCLEF 2025为生态研究提供了新的数据集和方法，推动了AI在植物多样性监测中的应用。

Abstract: Quadrat images are essential for ecological studies, as they enable
standardized sampling, the assessment of plant biodiversity, long-term
monitoring, and large-scale field campaigns. These images typically cover an
area of fifty centimetres or one square meter, and botanists carefully identify
all the species present. Integrating AI could help specialists accelerate their
inventories and expand the spatial coverage of ecological studies. To assess
progress in this area, the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge relies on a new test set of
2,105 high-resolution multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
around 400 species. It also provides a large training set of 1.4 million
individual plant images, along with vision transformer models pre-trained on
this data. The task is formulated as a (weakly labelled) multi-label
classification problem, where the goal is to predict all species present in a
quadrat image using single-label training data. This paper provides a detailed
description of the data, the evaluation methodology, the methods and models
used by participants, and the results achieved.

Result: 参赛方案通过结合现有方法和新流程，显著提升了基线性能。

Conclusion: 大规模预训练视觉（语言）模型对性能提升至关重要，但未来需解决实时性和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a strongly application-driven field of research.
Consequently, the connection between academia and industry is of paramount
importance. In this regard, we present the VAND 3.0 Challenge to showcase
current progress in anomaly detection across different practical settings
whilst addressing critical issues in the field. The challenge hosted two
tracks, fostering the development of anomaly detection methods robust against
real-world distribution shifts (Category 1) and exploring the capabilities of
Vision Language Models within the few-shot regime (Category 2), respectively.
The participants' solutions reached significant improvements over previous
baselines by combining or adapting existing approaches and fusing them with
novel pipelines. While for both tracks the progress in large pre-trained vision
(language) backbones played a pivotal role for the performance increase,
scaling up anomaly detection methods more efficiently needs to be addressed by
future research to meet real-time and computational constraints on-site.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无先验场景知识下相机内参估计的挑战，适用于自动驾驶等需要实时适应性的场景。

Method: 利用校准的三焦张量构建方程，从最小图像数据中实现相机自标定。

Result: 在合成环境和结构化数据集中验证了方法的有效性，优于现有学习方法和经典方法。

Conclusion: TrifocalCalib是一种高效、无需标定目标的相机自标定方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsic parameters without prior scene knowledge is a
fundamental challenge in computer vision. This capability is particularly
important for applications such as autonomous driving and vehicle platooning,
where precalibrated setups are impractical and real-time adaptability is
necessary. To advance the state-of-the-art, we present a set of equations based
on the calibrated trifocal tensor, enabling projective camera self-calibration
from minimal image data. Our method, termed TrifocalCalib, significantly
improves accuracy and robustness compared to both recent learning-based and
classical approaches. Unlike many existing techniques, our approach requires no
calibration target, imposes no constraints on camera motion, and simultaneously
estimates both focal length and principal point. Evaluations in both
procedurally generated synthetic environments and structured dataset-based
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To support
reproducibility, we make the code publicly available.

Motivation: 面对生物多样性危机，扩大对植物物种的理解对人类文明（如农业、建筑和药学）至关重要，但传统人工识别方法效率低下。

Method: 采用深度学习技术，解决数据量大、类别不平衡、错误识别等问题，并通过PlantCLEF2023挑战赛进行多图像分类实验。

Conclusion: PlantCLEF2023挑战赛为全球植物识别系统的开发提供了重要资源和方法，展示了深度学习在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: The world is estimated to be home to over 300,000 species of vascular plants.
In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, expanding our understanding of
these species is crucial for the advancement of human civilization,
encompassing areas such as agriculture, construction, and pharmacopoeia.
However, the labor-intensive process of plant identification undertaken by
human experts poses a significant obstacle to the accumulation of new data and
knowledge. Fortunately, recent advancements in automatic identification,
particularly through the application of deep learning techniques, have shown
promising progress. Despite challenges posed by data-related issues such as a
vast number of classes, imbalanced class distribution, erroneous
identifications, duplications, variable visual quality, and diverse visual
contents (such as photos or herbarium sheets), deep learning approaches have
reached a level of maturity which gives us hope that in the near future we will
have an identification system capable of accurately identifying all plant
species worldwide. The PlantCLEF2023 challenge aims to contribute to this
pursuit by addressing a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem
involving an extensive set of classes (80,000 plant species). This paper
provides an overview of the challenge's resources and evaluations, summarizes
the methods and systems employed by participating research groups, and presents
an analysis of key findings.

Result: 在InsertBench上优于现有商业解决方案。

Conclusion: OmniInsert为视频插入任务提供了高效且无需掩码的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in video insertion based on diffusion models are impressive.
However, existing methods rely on complex control signals but struggle with
subject consistency, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we
focus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key
challenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion
harmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline
InsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon
our data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for
mask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references.
Specifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet
effective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject
multi-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that
enables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video.
Meanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed
appearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we
propose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model
by simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser
module during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original
scenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce
InsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with
meticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert
outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will
be released.

Motivation: 全球植物多样性知识对人类文明发展至关重要，但人工识别限制了新数据的积累。自动识别技术（如深度学习）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 采用多图像和元数据分类方法，处理大量类别（8万种植物物种）及数据问题（类别不平衡、错误识别等）。

Result: 挑战赛展示了深度学习技术在植物识别中的成熟应用，并总结了参与团队的方法和系统。

Conclusion: PlantCLEF2022为全球植物多样性识别迈出了重要一步，展示了自动识别技术的潜力。

Abstract: It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 species of vascular plants
in the world. Increasing our knowledge of these species is of paramount
importance for the development of human civilization (agriculture,
construction, pharmacopoeia, etc.), especially in the context of the
biodiversity crisis. However, the burden of systematic plant identification by
human experts strongly penalizes the aggregation of new data and knowledge.
Since then, automatic identification has made considerable progress in recent
years as highlighted during all previous editions of PlantCLEF. Deep learning
techniques now seem mature enough to address the ultimate but realistic problem
of global identification of plant biodiversity in spite of many problems that
the data may present (a huge number of classes, very strongly unbalanced
classes, partially erroneous identifications, duplications, variable visual
quality, diversity of visual contents such as photos or herbarium sheets, etc).
The PlantCLEF2022 challenge edition proposes to take a step in this direction
by tackling a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem with a very
large number of classes (80k plant species). This paper presents the resources
and evaluations of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems
employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of key
findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了运动模式的个体差异，且未充分利用视频动态特征统计，导致时间错位问题难以解决。

Method: 通过自适应对齐模块（A²模块）和多尺度二阶矩块（M²块）构建网络，前者用于匹配，后者用于生成强表征。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的少样本动作识别基准测试中，A²M²-Net表现出色，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: A²M²-Net通过自适应对齐协议和多尺度二阶矩描述符，有效解决了时间错位问题，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Thanks to capability to alleviate the cost of large-scale annotation,
few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has attracted increased attention of
researchers in recent years. Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the
role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature
statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging
temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To
overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned
multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the
latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates
and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our
A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$
module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for
strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of
semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales.
Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate
descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our
A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem
by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation.
Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and
diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR
benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的推理时令牌驱逐策略，限制KV内存增长，显著降低内存使用且几乎不影响精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StreamVGGT等流式视觉Transformer因KV内存无限增长而受限，需解决内存问题以提升可扩展性。

Method: 通过驱逐冗余令牌保留关键信息，限制内存使用，支持更密集的帧采样。

Result: 在多个数据集上，内存峰值从18.63GB降至9.39GB，精度损失仅0.003，且重建精度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在低内存开销下保持性能，使长序列流式推理更实用。

Abstract: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception
but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits
scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy
that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most
informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no
drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from
18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under
strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves
reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video
depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and
camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely
matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming
inference more practical.

Motivation: 扩散模型在语义图像合成中计算成本高，SISMA旨在降低计算需求。

Conclusion: SISMA是轻量级替代方案，优于基于Transformer的模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become very popular for Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS)
of human faces. Nevertheless, their training and inference is computationally
expensive and their computational requirements are high due to the quadratic
complexity of attention layers. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture
called SISMA, based on the recently proposed Mamba. SISMA generates high
quality samples by controlling their shape using a semantic mask at a reduced
computational demand. We validated our approach through comprehensive
experiments with CelebAMask-HQ, revealing that our architecture not only
achieves a better FID score yet also operates at three times the speed of
state-of-the-art architectures. This indicates that the proposed design is a
viable, lightweight substitute to transformer-based models.

Abstract: With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology
has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion,
and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture
distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in
that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette
remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes
CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has
improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by
integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting
based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced
to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are
converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration
was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result,
CaP-VTON recorded 92.5\%, which is 15.4\% better than Leffa in short-sleeved
synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the
style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures
maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various
diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications
that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom
styling, and avatar creation.

Abstract: The early detection of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA) is
crucial for improving patient prognosis, yet its current diagnosis is highly
operator-dependent. This paper aims to make the first attempt to develop an
artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model-based method for both screening
and staging diagnosis of EGJA using endoscopic images. In this cohort and
learning study, we conducted a multicentre study across seven Chinese hospitals
between December 28, 2016 and December 30, 2024. It comprises 12,302 images
from 1,546 patients; 8,249 of them were employed for model training, while the
remaining were divided into the held-out (112 patients, 914 images), external
(230 patients, 1,539 images), and prospective (198 patients, 1,600 images) test
sets for evaluation. The proposed model employs DINOv2 (a vision foundation
model) and ResNet50 (a convolutional neural network) to extract features of
global appearance and local details of endoscopic images for EGJA staging
diagnosis. Our model demonstrates satisfactory performance for EGJA staging
diagnosis across three test sets, achieving an accuracy of 0.9256, 0.8895, and
0.8956, respectively. In contrast, among representative AI models, the best one
(ResNet50) achieves an accuracy of 0.9125, 0.8382, and 0.8519 on the three test
sets, respectively; the expert endoscopists achieve an accuracy of 0.8147 on
the held-out test set. Moreover, with the assistance of our model, the overall
accuracy for the trainee, competent, and expert endoscopists improves from
0.7035, 0.7350, and 0.8147 to 0.8497, 0.8521, and 0.8696, respectively. To our
knowledge, our model is the first application of foundation models for EGJA
staging diagnosis and demonstrates great potential in both diagnostic accuracy
and efficiency.

Conclusion: SD-VLM通过创新的数据集和方法显著提升了VLM的空间理解能力，为3D空间推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While vision language models (VLMs) excel in 2D semantic visual
understanding, their ability to quantitatively reason about 3D spatial
relationships remains under-explored, due to the deficiency of 2D images'
spatial representation ability. In this paper, we analyze the problem hindering
VLMs' spatial understanding abilities and propose SD-VLM, a novel framework
that significantly enhances fundamental spatial perception abilities of VLMs
through two key contributions: (1) propose Massive Spatial Measuring and
Understanding (MSMU) dataset with precise spatial annotations, and (2)
introduce a simple depth positional encoding method strengthening VLMs' spatial
awareness. MSMU dataset covers massive quantitative spatial tasks with 700K QA
pairs, 2.5M physical numerical annotations, and 10K chain-of-thought augmented
samples. We have trained SD-VLM, a strong generalist VLM which shows superior
quantitative spatial measuring and understanding capability. SD-VLM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance on our proposed MSMU-Bench, but also
shows spatial generalization abilities on other spatial understanding
benchmarks including Q-Spatial and SpatialRGPT-Bench. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SD-VLM outperforms GPT-4o and Intern-VL3-78B by 26.91% and

Abstract: Depth imaging is a crucial area in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), as it
plays a key role in detecting and measuring objects in the vehicle's
surroundings. However, a significant challenge in this domain arises from
missing information in Depth images, where certain points are not measurable
due to gaps or inconsistencies in pixel data. Our research addresses two key
tasks to overcome this challenge. First, we developed an algorithm using a
multi-layered training approach to generate Depth images from a single RGB
image. Second, we addressed the issue of missing information in Depth images by
applying our algorithm to rectify these gaps, resulting in Depth images with
complete and accurate data. We further tested our algorithm on the Cityscapes
dataset and successfully resolved the missing information in its Depth images,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FIQA技术中，监督方法需要大量训练，非监督方法性能较低且速度慢，FROQ旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用FR模型的中间表示和基于样本扰动的伪质量标签，无需显式训练即可估计图像质量。

Result: 在多个FR模型和数据集上，FROQ表现出与最先进方法竞争的性能和高效运行时间。

Conclusion: FROQ提供了一种高效且无需训练的FIQA解决方案，结合了监督和非监督方法的优点。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) plays a crucial role in many critical (high-stakes)
applications, where errors in the recognition process can lead to serious
consequences. Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) techniques enhance FR
systems by providing quality estimates of face samples, enabling the systems to
discard samples that are unsuitable for reliable recognition or lead to
low-confidence recognition decisions. Most state-of-the-art FIQA techniques
rely on extensive supervised training to achieve accurate quality estimation.
In contrast, unsupervised techniques eliminate the need for additional training
but tend to be slower and typically exhibit lower performance. In this paper,
we introduce FROQ (Face Recognition Observer of Quality), a semi-supervised,
training-free approach that leverages specific intermediate representations
within a given FR model to estimate face-image quality, and combines the
efficiency of supervised FIQA models with the training-free approach of
unsupervised methods. A simple calibration step based on pseudo-quality labels
allows FROQ to uncover specific representations, useful for quality assessment,
in any modern FR model. To generate these pseudo-labels, we propose a novel
unsupervised FIQA technique based on sample perturbations. Comprehensive
experiments with four state-of-the-art FR models and eight benchmark datasets
show that FROQ leads to highly competitive results compared to the
state-of-the-art, achieving both strong performance and efficient runtime,
without requiring explicit training.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems applied to new domains require an abundance of
expensive, pixel-level dense labels to train robust semantic segmentation
models under full supervision. This study proposes a model-agnostic Depth Edge
Alignment Loss to improve Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation models across
different datasets. The methodology generates pixel-level semantic labels from
image-level supervision, avoiding expensive annotation processes. While weak
supervision is widely explored in traditional computer vision, our approach
adds supervision with pixel-level depth information, a modality commonly
available in robotic systems. We demonstrate how our approach improves
segmentation performance across datasets and models, but can also be combined
with other losses for even better performance, with improvements up to +5.439,
+1.274 and +16.416 points in mean Intersection over Union on the PASCAL VOC /
MS COCO validation, and the HOPE static onboarding split, respectively. Our
code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经动力学驱动的耦合神经P系统（ND-CNPFuse），用于多焦点图像融合任务，通过可解释的尖峰矩阵生成高质量决策图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于启发式规则的方法和深度学习黑盒机制难以生成高质量决策图，因此需要一种更精确的方法。

Method: 利用神经动力学分析网络参数与输入信号的约束关系，提出ND-CNPFuse模型，通过尖峰矩阵直接生成决策图。

Result: 在四个经典数据集上达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: ND-CNPFuse通过神经动力学驱动的方法显著提升了决策图的准确性，适用于多焦点图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is a crucial technique in image processing,
with a key challenge being the generation of decision maps with precise
boundaries. However, traditional methods based on heuristic rules and deep
learning methods with black-box mechanisms are difficult to generate
high-quality decision maps. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
neurodynamics-driven coupled neural P (CNP) systems, which are third-generation
neural computation models inspired by spiking mechanisms, to enhance the
accuracy of decision maps. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis
of the model's neurodynamics to identify the constraints between the network
parameters and the input signals. This solid analysis avoids abnormal
continuous firing of neurons and ensures the model accurately distinguishes
between focused and unfocused regions, generating high-quality decision maps
for MFIF. Based on this analysis, we propose a
\textbf{N}eurodynamics-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{CNP} \textbf{F}usion model
(\textbf{ND-CNPFuse}) tailored for the challenging MFIF task. Unlike current
ideas of decision map generation, ND-CNPFuse distinguishes between focused and
unfocused regions by mapping the source image into interpretable spike
matrices. By comparing the number of spikes, an accurate decision map can be
generated directly without any post-processing. Extensive experimental results
show that ND-CNPFuse achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four
classical MFIF datasets, including Lytro, MFFW, MFI-WHU, and Real-MFF. The code
is available at https://github.com/MorvanLi/ND-CNPFuse.

Motivation: 标准化多式联运装载单元（ILUs）的高效识别是全球贸易的关键瓶颈，CV技术提供了成本效益高的替代方案，但发展受限。

Method: 回顾63项实证研究，分析从DIP到DL的技术演变，并探讨数据集和新兴挑战。

Result: 报告结果差异大（准确率5%-96%），数据集不足和场景文本识别等挑战突出。

Conclusion: 呼吁标准化术语、开放数据集和共享代码，未来研究方向包括针对ISO6346代码的无上下文文本识别。

Abstract: The standardisation of Intermodal Loading Units (ILUs), such as containers,
semi-trailers and swap bodies, has revolutionised global trade yet their
efficient and robust identification remains a critical bottleneck in
high-throughput ports and terminals. This paper reviews 63 empirical studies
that propose computer vision (CV) based solutions. It covers the last 35 years
(1990-2025), tracing the field's evolution from early digital image processing
(DIP) and traditional machine learning (ML) to the current dominance of deep
learning (DL) techniques. While CV offers cost-effective alternatives for other
types of identification techniques, its development is hindered by the lack of
publicly available benchmarking datasets. This results in high variance for the
reported results such as end-to-end accuracy ranging from 5 % to 96 %. Beyond
dataset limitations, this review highlights the emerging challenges especially
introduced by the shift from character-based text recognition to scene-text
spotting and the integration of mobile cameras (e.g. drones, sensor equipped
ground vehicles) for dynamic terminal monitoring. To advance the field, the
paper calls for standardised terminology, open-access datasets, shared source
code, while outlining future research directions such as contextless text
recognition optimised for ISO6346 codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达-相机融合方法在性能上仍落后于LiDAR方法，且现有方法未充分解决物体运动或传感器误差带来的不确定性。

Method: 提出RCTDistill，包含RAKD、TKD和RDKD三个模块，分别处理距离-方位误差、时间对齐和特征区分。

Result: 在nuScenes和VoD数据集上达到最优性能，推理速度26.2 FPS。

Conclusion: RCTDistill通过多模块协同显著提升了雷达-相机融合的检测性能。

Abstract: Radar-camera fusion methods have emerged as a cost-effective approach for 3D
object detection but still lag behind LiDAR-based methods in performance.
Recent works have focused on employing temporal fusion and Knowledge
Distillation (KD) strategies to overcome these limitations. However, existing
approaches have not sufficiently accounted for uncertainties arising from
object motion or sensor-specific errors inherent in radar and camera
modalities. In this work, we propose RCTDistill, a novel cross-modal KD method
based on temporal fusion, comprising three key modules: Range-Azimuth Knowledge
Distillation (RAKD), Temporal Knowledge Distillation (TKD), and
Region-Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (RDKD). RAKD is designed to consider
the inherent errors in the range and azimuth directions, enabling effective
knowledge transfer from LiDAR features to refine inaccurate BEV
representations. TKD mitigates temporal misalignment caused by dynamic objects
by aligning historical radar-camera BEV features with current LiDAR
representations. RDKD enhances feature discrimination by distilling relational
knowledge from the teacher model, allowing the student to differentiate
foreground and background features. RCTDistill achieves state-of-the-art
radar-camera fusion performance on both the nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD)
datasets, with the fastest inference speed of 26.2 FPS.

TL;DR: WISE方法通过弱监督增强图像分类数据集，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的可解释性和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCoT方法依赖丰富的数据集且忽视了对图像分类至关重要的对象内理解，WISE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）的概念表示，在弱监督下生成简洁、可解释的推理链。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验显示，生成的MCoTs提升可解释性37%，并提高分类准确性。

Conclusion: WISE连接了基于概念的可解释性和生成式MCoT推理，为增强MLLMs在细粒度视觉理解中的表现提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-textual
reasoning, with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting significantly
enhancing interpretability. However, existing MCoT methods rely on
rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning,
overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To
address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step
Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by
reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision.
Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve
interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when
used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and
generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing
MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖闭源模型、缺乏系统推理能力及长视频问答（videoQA）表现不佳的问题。

Method: 设计高效视觉模块支持长视频任务，构建快慢推理数据集，结合FS-LLM进行快慢推理，并通过参数搜索优化视觉程序。

Result: 在LVBench上超越GPT-4o，与Qwen2.5VL-72B在VideoMME上的性能相当。

Conclusion: FS-VisPR通过自适应推理和参数优化，显著提升了视觉程序工作流的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program
workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on
closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form
video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce
the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that
balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult
ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and
subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a
diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align
open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as
FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple
queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual
program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this
process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage
slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated
if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through
parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the
parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are
generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected,
while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is
applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and
reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench,
surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.

Method: 采用双视角对齐学习提取互补特征，结合分层提示调优策略（全局和局部提示）学习任务特定知识，并设计语义一致性损失防止偏离预训练模型知识。

Result: 在MS-COCO和VOC2007基准测试中，mAP分别提升10.0%/5.2%（长尾任务）和6.8%/2.9%（少样本任务）。

Conclusion: HP-DVAL有效解决了多标签图像分类中的类别不平衡问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance across multiple categories,
manifesting as long-tailed distributions and few-shot scenarios. This is
especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification
(CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present
significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method
termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which
leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to
mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically,
HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature
representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary
features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for
CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes
global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior
knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt
tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge
embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two
CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP
improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image
classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image
classification task.

Conclusion: 该方法通过协作推理和语义指导，显著提升了遮挡物体修复的准确性和视觉效果。

Abstract: Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital
for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with
data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We
propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront
collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple
agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine
necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting.
Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling
Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and
prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially
within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces
layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a
Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.

TL;DR: Neural-MMGS是一种新型神经3DGS框架，通过融合多模态感知数据（图像、LiDAR和语义）到紧凑可学习的嵌入中，实现大规模场景重建，降低内存开销并提升可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用LiDAR的丰富物理属性和语义信息的高层上下文，且传统方法将多模态数据作为独立参数附加到高斯分布上，导致内存增加和信息交换受限。

Method: 提出将多模态数据融合为紧凑可学习的嵌入，并通过轻量级神经解码器映射到高斯参数，实现多模态重建。

Conclusion: Neural-MMGS通过多模态融合和紧凑嵌入设计，显著提升了大规模场景重建的效率和质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes Neural-MMGS, a novel neural 3DGS framework for multimodal
large-scale scene reconstruction that fuses multiple sensing modalities in a
per-gaussian compact, learnable embedding. While recent works focusing on
large-scale scene reconstruction have incorporated LiDAR data to provide more
accurate geometric constraints, we argue that LiDAR's rich physical properties
remain underexplored. Similarly, semantic information has been used for object
retrieval, but could provide valuable high-level context for scene
reconstruction. Traditional approaches append these properties to Gaussians as
separate parameters, increasing memory usage and limiting information exchange
across modalities. Instead, our approach fuses all modalities -- image, LiDAR,
and semantics -- into a compact, learnable embedding that implicitly encodes
optical, physical, and semantic features in each Gaussian. We then train
lightweight neural decoders to map these embeddings to Gaussian parameters,
enabling the reconstruction of each sensing modality with lower memory overhead
and improved scalability. We evaluate Neural-MMGS on the Oxford Spires and
KITTI-360 datasets. On Oxford Spires, we achieve higher-quality
reconstructions, while on KITTI-360, our method reaches competitive results
with less storage consumption compared with current approaches in LiDAR-based
novel-view synthesis.

Motivation: 生物神经元具有不应期特性，而现有SNN模型（如IF和LIF）忽略了这一点，可能导致过度兴奋和异常信号干扰。

Method: 通过脉冲触发的阈值动态（spike-triggered threshold dynamics）将不应期整合到LIF神经元中。

Result: RPLIF在Cifar10-DVS（82.40%）、N-Caltech101（83.35%）和DVS128 Gesture（97.22%）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RPLIF方法简单高效，显著提升了SNNs的性能和鲁棒性，且计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: As the third generation of neural networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have recently gained widespread attention for their biological plausibility,
energy efficiency, and effectiveness in processing neuromorphic datasets. To
better emulate biological neurons, various models such as Integrate-and-Fire
(IF) and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) have been widely adopted in SNNs.
However, these neuron models overlook the refractory period, a fundamental
characteristic of biological neurons. Research on excitable neurons reveal that
after firing, neurons enter a refractory period during which they are
temporarily unresponsive to subsequent stimuli. This mechanism is critical for
preventing over-excitation and mitigating interference from aberrant signals.
Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective method to incorporate the
refractory period into spiking LIF neurons through spike-triggered threshold
dynamics, termed RPLIF. Our method ensures that each spike accurately encodes
neural information, effectively preventing neuron over-excitation under
continuous inputs and interference from anomalous inputs. Incorporating the
refractory period into LIF neurons is seamless and computationally efficient,
enhancing robustness and efficiency while yielding better performance with
negligible overhead. To the best of our knowledge, RPLIF achieves
state-of-the-art performance on Cifar10-DVS(82.40%) and N-Caltech101(83.35%)
with fewer timesteps and demonstrates superior performance on DVS128
Gesture(97.22%) at low latency.

Result: 实验表明I2VWM显著提高了水印的鲁棒性，同时保持不可感知性。

Conclusion: I2VWM为生成视频时代的跨模态水印建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-guided video generation (I2V) has raised concerns
about its potential misuse in misinformation and fraud, underscoring the urgent
need for effective digital watermarking. While existing watermarking methods
demonstrate robustness within a single modality, they fail to trace source
images in I2V settings. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Robust
Diffusion Distance, which measures the temporal persistence of watermark
signals in generated videos. Building on this, we propose I2VWM, a cross-modal
watermarking framework designed to enhance watermark robustness across time.
I2VWM leverages a video-simulation noise layer during training and employs an
optical-flow-based alignment module during inference. Experiments on both
open-source and commercial I2V models demonstrate that I2VWM significantly
improves robustness while maintaining imperceptibility, establishing a new
paradigm for cross-modal watermarking in the era of generative video.

Conclusion: Core Space框架高效且准确，适用于视觉和语言任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank
adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient
adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning
has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly
efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging
fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which
enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis,
thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially
improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that
projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a
complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results
demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques
and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while
utilizing a fraction of the computational resources. Codebase is available at

Conclusion: R-Splatting通过统一框架有效解决了水下3D重建中的图像退化问题。

Abstract: Underwater image degradation poses significant challenges for 3D
reconstruction, where simplified physical models often fail in complex scenes.
We propose \textbf{R-Splatting}, a unified framework that bridges underwater
image restoration (UIR) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve both
rendering quality and geometric fidelity. Our method integrates multiple
enhanced views produced by diverse UIR models into a single reconstruction
pipeline. During inference, a lightweight illumination generator samples latent
codes to support diverse yet coherent renderings, while a contrastive loss
ensures disentangled and stable illumination representations. Furthermore, we
propose \textit{Uncertainty-Aware Opacity Optimization (UAOO)}, which models
opacity as a stochastic function to regularize training. This suppresses abrupt
gradient responses triggered by illumination variation and mitigates
overfitting to noisy or view-specific artifacts. Experiments on Seathru-NeRF
and our new BlueCoral3D dataset demonstrate that R-Splatting outperforms strong
baselines in both rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动推断退化感知表示，显著提升了全能图像恢复的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as
haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and
downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches
either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural
priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions
that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this
limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where
degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input
without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a
structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature
selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to
restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that
efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive
restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five
compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average
PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.

Conclusion: TS-P²CL通过视觉语义对齐和双对比学习，有效缓解个体特异性偏差，学习领域不变特征，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is pivotal for intelligent
healthcare, yet its efficacy is severely limited by poor cross-subject
generation due to the profound cross-individual heterogeneity. Despite advances
in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods
remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their
ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we
propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the
universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We
introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals
into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This
transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from
natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive
learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while
cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics,
thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust,
domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets

subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.

### [192] [Selecting Optimal Camera Views for Gait Analysis: A Multi-Metric Assessment of 2D Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17805)
*Dong Chen,Huili Peng,Yong Hu,Kenneth MC. Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了正面和侧面视角对2D无标记步态分析准确性的影响，发现侧面视角在矢状面运动学上更优，而正面视角在躯干对称性参数上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化相机视角（正面vs.侧面）对2D无标记步态分析准确性的影响，以3D运动捕捉为基准。

Method: 使用YOLOv8进行姿态估计，评估了四种指标（DTW、MCC、KLD、IE），并通过统计测试比较差异。

Result: 侧面视角在步长和膝关节旋转上显著优于正面视角，而正面视角在躯干旋转和手腕到髋部距离上表现更好。

Conclusion: 相机视角对步态参数准确性至关重要，建议根据需求选择视角，未来可结合两种视角优化临床应用。

Abstract: Objective: To systematically quantify the effect of the camera view (frontal
vs. lateral) on the accuracy of 2D markerless gait analysis relative to 3D
motion capture ground truth. Methods: Gait data from 18 subjects were recorded
simultaneously using frontal, lateral and 3D motion capture systems. Pose
estimation used YOLOv8. Four metrics were assessed to evaluate agreement:
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal alignment, Maximum Cross-Correlation
(MCC) for signal similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for distribution
differences, and Information Entropy (IE) for complexity. Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests (significance: $p < 0.05$) and Cliff's delta ($\delta$) were used to
measure statistical differences and effect sizes. Results: Lateral views
significantly outperformed frontal views for sagittal plane kinematics: step
length (DTW: $53.08 \pm 24.50$ vs. $69.87 \pm 25.36$, $p = 0.005$) and knee
rotation (DTW: $106.46 \pm 38.57$ vs. $155.41 \pm 41.77$, $p = 0.004$). Frontal
views were superior for symmetry parameters: trunk rotation (KLD: $0.09 \pm
0.06$ vs. $0.30 \pm 0.19$, $p < 0.001$) and wrist-to-hipmid distance (MCC:
$105.77 \pm 29.72$ vs. $75.20 \pm 20.38$, $p = 0.003$). Effect sizes were
medium-to-large ($\delta: 0.34$--$0.76$). Conclusion: Camera view critically
impacts gait parameter accuracy. Lateral views are optimal for sagittal
kinematics; frontal views excel for trunk symmetry. Significance: This first
systematic evidence enables data-driven camera deployment in 2D gait analysis,
enhancing clinical utility. Future implementations should leverage both views
via disease-oriented setups.

TL;DR: GLARE是一种新的自监督预训练任务，用于提升视觉基础模型在新领域的语义分割性能，通过局部和区域一致性约束实现高效预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在有限数据条件下，如何将自监督学习预训练扩展到新领域，特别是密集预测任务（如语义分割）。

Method: 提出GLARE任务，结合局部增强和区域一致性约束，使用轻量级适配器模块（UniAdapter）进行高效预训练。

Result: 在多个语义分割基准测试中，GLARE显著提升了性能，且计算和参数开销极小。

Conclusion: GLARE为视觉基础模型在新领域的自监督预训练提供了一种高效且有效的方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training
foundation models by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets, often producing
representations with strong generalization capabilities. These models are
typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and
subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While
recent advances have explored parameter-efficient strategies for adapting
pre-trained models, extending SSL pre-training itself to new domains -
particularly under limited data regimes and for dense prediction tasks -
remains underexplored. In this work, we address the problem of adapting vision
foundation models to new domains in an unsupervised and data-efficient manner,
specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE
(Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised
pre-training task designed to enhance downstream segmentation performance.
GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and
incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics
in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision
Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only
lightweight adapter modules - specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest
of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation
benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves
downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在U-Net架构中存在反转不准确和上下文冲突问题，而在DiT中这些问题更复杂，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用高阶Rectified Flow求解器建立编辑基础，通过自适应上下文增强机制动态融合信息，并基于Guidance Responsiveness Metric确定关键层。

Result: ContextFlow在实验中显著优于现有无需训练方法，甚至超越部分基于训练的方法，提供高保真和时间一致的结果。

Conclusion: ContextFlow通过创新机制解决了DiT视频对象编辑中的关键问题，展示了卓越性能。

Abstract: Training-free video object editing aims to achieve precise object-level
manipulation, including object insertion, swapping, and deletion. However, it
faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency.
Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two
primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and
contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues
are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability
of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To
address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free
framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a
high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The
core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to
edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing
features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value
pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to
dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this
enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven
analysis to identify task-specific vital layers. Based on a novel Guidance
Responsiveness Metric, our method pinpoints the most influential DiT blocks for
different tasks (e.g., insertion, swapping), enabling targeted and highly
effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that ContextFlow significantly
outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses several
state-of-the-art training-based approaches, delivering temporally coherent,
high-fidelity results.

Motivation: 解决组织病理学中合成数据生成的挑战，如保留组织异质性、捕捉细微形态特征，并扩展到无标注数据集。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型，结合语义分割图和特定组织视觉裁剪的双条件方法，并引入自监督扩展处理无标注数据。

Result: 在Camelyon16、Panda和TCGA数据集上，合成数据在定量评估中表现优异，下游分割任务性能接近真实数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算病理学中多样化和标注数据的生成提供了实用解决方案，解决了关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges:
preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and
scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that
generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel
dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with
tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts
or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological
details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic
regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches
ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we
introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100
tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating
pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images
with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on
downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models
trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on
real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue
generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet
Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower
FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on
synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within
1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA
whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical
solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology
data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线动态场景重建方法，通过解耦静态和动态部分，结合运动掩码策略和动态图适应，实现了高质量重建和跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法通常仅移除动态部分或依赖RGB-D输入，离线方法无法处理长视频序列，而基于Transformer的前馈方法缺乏全局一致性和外观细节。

Method: 在SLAM系统中解耦静态和动态部分，采用运动掩码策略进行鲁棒位姿跟踪，并利用动态图适应重建动态部分。

Result: 方法生成的新视角渲染质量与离线方法相当，跟踪性能与最先进的动态SLAM方法持平。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在线动态场景重建，兼具全局一致性和细节表现，适用于RGB和RGB-D输入。

Abstract: Achieving truly practical dynamic 3D reconstruction requires online
operation, global pose and map consistency, detailed appearance modeling, and
the flexibility to handle both RGB and RGB-D inputs. However, existing SLAM
methods typically merely remove the dynamic parts or require RGB-D input, while
offline methods are not scalable to long video sequences, and current
transformer-based feedforward methods lack global consistency and appearance
details. To this end, we achieve online dynamic scene reconstruction by
disentangling the static and dynamic parts within a SLAM system. The poses are
tracked robustly with a novel motion masking strategy, and dynamic parts are
reconstructed leveraging a progressive adaptation of a Motion Scaffolds graph.
Our method yields novel view renderings competitive to offline methods and
achieves on-par tracking with state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法主观且可能忽略关键事件，限制了其普适性和一致性，需要更客观的评估框架。

Method: 结合认知任务分析（CTA）和多模态学习分析（MMLA），开发了基于视觉的动作识别流程和领域特定的CTA模型。

Result: 通过自动化性能指标（如反应时间、任务时长）和分层CTA模型，实现了可解释且与领域相关的绩效评估。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动评估框架为CCATT训练提供了更客观、全面的绩效评估方法。

Abstract: This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are
trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure
conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and
respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing
ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient
performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as
situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and
coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress.
Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more
objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional
instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events,
thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated
and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI
algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental
noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To
address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment
framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning
Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT
training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned
Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to
detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions
automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task
duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT
operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.

Motivation: 探讨音频在视频理解中的实际作用，揭示当前评估方法的局限性。

Method: 基于LLaVA-OneVision架构，结合Whisper音频编码器和Mamba-based token压缩器。

Result: 音频在现有视频基准测试中作用有限，但在音频敏感任务中至关重要。

Conclusion: 需改进评估方法以更真实反映视频理解能力，并提供开源工具支持。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding,"
yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct
question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and
the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that
many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely
redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio
encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio
token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We
find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive
on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release
AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a
growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and
provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully
open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MRI脑肿瘤分割中因扫描仪、协议变异和人群异质性导致的域偏移问题，特别是在低资源和儿科队列中。

Result: 在撒哈拉以南非洲和儿科胶质瘤数据集上表现优异，Dice准确率和边界精度显著提升。

Conclusion: SmaRT填补了算法进步与公平临床适用性之间的差距，支持在不同临床环境中稳健部署MRI工具。

Abstract: Reliable brain tumor segmentation in MRI is indispensable for treatment
planning and outcome monitoring, yet models trained on curated benchmarks often
fail under domain shifts arising from scanner and protocol variability as well
as population heterogeneity. Such gaps are especially severe in low-resource
and pediatric cohorts, where conventional test-time or source-free adaptation
strategies often suffer from instability and structural inconsistency. We
propose SmaRT, a style-modulated robust test-time adaptation framework that
enables source-free cross-domain generalization. SmaRT integrates style-aware
augmentation to mitigate appearance discrepancies, a dual-branch momentum
strategy for stable pseudo-label refinement, and structural priors enforcing
consistency, integrity, and connectivity. This synergy ensures both adaptation
stability and anatomical fidelity under extreme domain shifts. Extensive
evaluations on sub-Saharan Africa and pediatric glioma datasets show that SmaRT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in Dice
accuracy and boundary precision. Overall, SmaRT bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and equitable clinical applicability, supporting robust
deployment of MRI-based neuro-oncology tools in diverse clinical environments.

Result: 在100名患者数据集上验证，该方法比基于nnUNet的分割方法表现更优，精度和F1分数更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂临床场景中的针定位提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate multi-needle localization in intraoperative CT images is crucial for
optimizing seed placement in pelvic seed implant brachytherapy. However, this
task is challenging due to poor image contrast and needle adhesion. This paper
presents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle
detection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free
network, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and
accurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and
orientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle
prediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a
greedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced
assignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method
iteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on
a distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100
patients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving
higher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing
the nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for
needle localization in complex clinical scenarios.

Result: 在ReBO数据集上验证了DragOSM的有效性，显著提升了标签对齐和建筑结构描述的准确性。

Conclusion: DragOSM为利用历史标签进行遥感图像标注提供了一种高效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Extracting polygonal roofs and footprints from remote sensing images is
critical for large-scale urban analysis. Most existing methods rely on
segmentation-based models that assume clear semantic boundaries of roofs, but
these approaches struggle in off- nadir images, where the roof and footprint
are significantly displaced, and facade pixels are fused with the roof
boundary. With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations,
e.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation
has become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once
captured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant
positional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or
footprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building. To
address these discrepancies, we first introduce a concept of an alignment
token, which encodes the correction vector to guide the label correction. Based
on this concept, we then propose Drag OpenStreetMap Labels (DragOSM), a novel
model designed to align dislocated historical labels with roofs and footprints.
Specifically, DragOSM formulates the label alignment as an interactive
denoising process, modeling the positional discrepancy as a Gaussian
distribution. During training, it learns to correct these errors by simulating
misalignment with random Gaussian perturbations; during inference, it
iteratively refines the positions of input labels. To validate our method, we
further present a new dataset, Repairing Buildings in OSM (ReBO), comprising
179,265 buildings with both OpenStreetMap and manually corrected annotations
across 5,473 images from 41 cities. Experimental results on ReBO demonstrate
the effectiveness of DragOSM. Code, dataset, and trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/likaiucas/DragOSM.git.

Conclusion: CoPS成功克服了离散化限制，实现了高效的连续物理模拟建模。

Abstract: The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial
observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be
sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it
difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and
engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often
constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some
researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel
strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to
truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we
propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous
physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ
multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the
corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use
message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the
customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by
designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural
auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art
methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.

Result: 在KITTI和COCO数据集上，压缩模型在降低复杂度的同时，性能甚至超过原始模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了检测模型压缩中的关键问题，显著提升了模型效率与性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful, yet their high complexity greatly limits
their potential to be deployed on billions of resource-constrained edge
devices. Pruning is a crucial network compression technique, yet most existing
methods focus on classification models, with limited attention to detection.
Even among those addressing detection, there is a lack of utilization of
essential localization information. Also, many pruning methods passively rely
on pre-trained models, in which useful and useless components are intertwined,
making it difficult to remove the latter without harming the former at the
neuron/filter level. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a
proactive detection-discriminants-based network compression approach for deep
visual detectors, which alternates between two steps: (1) maximizing and
compressing detection-related discriminants and aligning them with a subset of
neurons/filters immediately before the detection head, and (2) tracing the
detection-related discriminating power across the layers and discarding
features of lower importance. Object location information is exploited in both
steps. Extensive experiments, employing four advanced detection models and four
state-of-the-art competing methods on the KITTI and COCO datasets, highlight
the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, our compressed models can even
beat the original base models with a substantial reduction in complexity.

Motivation: 扩散模型的进步提升了AI生成内容的真实性，但也引发了滥用担忧，需要强大的版权保护和篡改定位解决方案。

Method: 提出StableGuard框架，结合MPW-VAE和MoE-GFN，通过自监督端到端设计实现水印嵌入和篡改检测。

Result: 实验表明，StableGuard在图像保真度、水印验证和篡改定位方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableGuard为扩散模型提供了高效、可靠的版权保护和篡改定位解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated
content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright
protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made
progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing
introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic
reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly
integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring
copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models
through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE)
by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight
latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked
and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a
diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further
enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic
Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns,
local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark
verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly
optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal
training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and
tampering localization.

Result: GPT-5定位准确率49.7%，GPT-4为39.1%，MedGemma为17.7%，均低于CNN（59.9%）和放射科医生（80.1%）。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在医学图像定位中表现有限，需结合任务专用工具以提高可靠性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models
(LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic
tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their
accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental
aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological
findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational
relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of
anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs
(GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to
localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that
overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged
across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a
localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%),
all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark
(80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's
predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always
precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical
locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited
anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the
lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize
to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of
current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating
them with task-specific tools for reliable use.

TL;DR: NeuS-QA是一种无需训练的神经符号化方法，通过将自然语言问题转化为时序逻辑表达式，并验证视频片段是否满足逻辑要求，显著提升了长视频问答（LVQA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长视频问答中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏显式的时序表示和逻辑验证能力，导致无法处理复杂查询中的多步时序推理和因果关系。

Method: NeuS-QA将自然语言问题转化为时序逻辑表达式，构建视频自动机，并通过模型检查验证视频片段是否满足逻辑要求，仅将验证通过的片段输入VLM。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和CinePile数据集上，NeuS-QA性能提升超过10%，尤其在涉及事件顺序、因果关系和多步组合推理的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: NeuS-QA通过引入时序逻辑和模型检查，解决了长视频问答中的逻辑推理问题，显著提升了性能，且无需修改或微调现有模型。

Abstract: Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional
visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or
short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in
those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos
involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches,
which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur
significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model
often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key
temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these
limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling,
hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However,
these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal
representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a
result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually
encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address
these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play
neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language
question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton
from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to
rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical
requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus
improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional
reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on
LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%,
especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: TempSamp-R1是一种新的强化微调框架，通过结合离策略监督和非线性软优势计算，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在视频时间定位任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO）在时间搜索空间大的任务中效率低且性能有限，TempSamp-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用真实标注作为离策略监督，引入非线性软优势计算，并采用混合Chain-of-Thought训练范式。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，如Charades-STA（R1@0.7: 52.9%）、ActivityNet Captions（R1@0.5: 56.0%）和QVHighlights（mAP: 30.0%）。

Conclusion: TempSamp-R1在时间定位任务中实现了新的SOTA性能，并展示了强大的少样本泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces TempSamp-R1, a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework
designed to improve the effectiveness of adapting multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) to video temporal grounding tasks. We reveal that existing
reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with
large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and
limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate
solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth
annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,
effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy
solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based
updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method
that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.
By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1
optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference
modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning
complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms
GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions
(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover,
TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited
data. Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/TempSamp-R1

demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to
conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale
synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GeoSVR通过稀疏体素和新型约束机制，显著提升了表面重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate surfaces with radiance fields has achieved remarkable
progress in recent years. However, prevailing approaches, primarily based on
Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly constrained by representational
bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce GeoSVR, an explicit voxel-based
framework that explores and extends the under-investigated potential of sparse
voxels for achieving accurate, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction.
As strengths, sparse voxels support preserving the coverage completeness and
geometric clarity, while corresponding challenges also arise from absent scene
constraints and locality in surface refinement. To ensure correct scene
convergence, we first propose a Voxel-Uncertainty Depth Constraint that
maximizes the effect of monocular depth cues while presenting a voxel-oriented
uncertainty to avoid quality degradation, enabling effective and robust scene
constraints yet preserving highly accurate geometries. Subsequently, Sparse
Voxel Surface Regularization is designed to enhance geometric consistency for
tiny voxels and facilitate the voxel-based formation of sharp and accurate
surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance compared
to existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, excelling in
geometric accuracy, detail preservation, and reconstruction completeness while
maintaining high efficiency. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为更可配置的人类图像合成提供了新途径，结合了视觉提示和文本驱动生成。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over
attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in
personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity
preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide
disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new
paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of
reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of
human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes
these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and
disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people
within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust
disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring
subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute
cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate
faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both
identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and
textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image
synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation. Webpage is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在像素级细粒度理解方面关注不足，无法将感知能力整合到视觉推理中。

Result: 在10个基准测试中验证了有效性，包括像素级引用/分割和图像/视频中的对象中心理解。

Conclusion: UniPixel成功整合了像素级感知与视觉推理，设计的新任务PixelQA验证了其灵活性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular
focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less
attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding
capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment
between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have
applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring
expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either
referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these
fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap,
we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly
comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our
model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception
with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel
processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs
subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during
inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The
effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a
diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and
object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that
jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also
designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at translating language prompts into
photorealistic images by implicitly grounding textual concepts through their
cross-modal attention mechanisms. Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers
extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and
text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However,
a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to
image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff
(Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the
attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate
semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we
identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that
consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions,
naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further
demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated
image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and
thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity.
Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of
diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both
segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that
bridge visual perception and generation.

Conclusion: 该方法在动态表面重建中表现出色，尤其适用于长序列和未见过的物体与运动。

Abstract: Dynamic surface reconstruction of objects from point cloud sequences is a
challenging field in computer graphics. Existing approaches either require
multiple regularization terms or extensive training data which, however, lead
to compromises in reconstruction accuracy as well as over-smoothing or poor
generalization to unseen objects and motions. To address these lim- itations,
we introduce Preconditioned Deformation Grids, a novel technique for estimating
coherent deformation fields directly from unstructured point cloud sequences
without requiring or forming explicit correspondences. Key to our approach is
the use of multi-resolution voxel grids that capture the overall motion at
varying spatial scales, enabling a more flexible deformation representation. In
conjunction with incorporating grid-based Sobolev preconditioning into
gradient-based optimization, we show that applying a Chamfer loss between the
input point clouds as well as to an evolving template mesh is sufficient to
obtain accurate deformations. To ensure temporal consistency along the object
surface, we include a weak isometry loss on mesh edges which complements the
main objective without constraining deformation fidelity. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior results, particularly for long
sequences, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 几何信息对解析语义模糊的雷达信号至关重要。

Abstract: Radar has shown strong potential for robust perception in autonomous driving;
however, raw radar images are frequently degraded by noise and "ghost"
artifacts, making object detection based solely on semantic features highly
challenging. To address this limitation, we introduce RaFD, a radar-based
object detection framework that estimates inter-frame bird's-eye-view (BEV)
flow and leverages the resulting geometric cues to enhance detection accuracy.
Specifically, we design a supervised flow estimation auxiliary task that is
jointly trained with the detection network. The estimated flow is further
utilized to guide feature propagation from the previous frame to the current
one. Our flow-guided, radar-only detector achieves achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the RADIATE dataset, underscoring the importance of
incorporating geometric information to effectively interpret radar signals,
which are inherently ambiguous in semantics.

Conclusion: Tac-Nav系统显著提升了导航意图识别的准确性和用户体验。

Abstract: Robot assistive navigation (RAN) is critical for enhancing the mobility and
independence of the growing population of mobility-impaired individuals.
However, existing systems often rely on interfaces that fail to replicate the
intuitive and efficient physical communication observed between a person and a
human caregiver, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce
Tac-Nav, a RAN system that leverages a cylindrical tactile skin mounted on a
Stretch 3 mobile manipulator to provide a more natural and efficient interface
for human navigational intent recognition. To robustly classify the tactile
data, we developed the Cylindrical Kernel Support Vector Machine (CK-SVM), an
algorithm that explicitly models the sensor's cylindrical geometry and is
consequently robust to the natural rotational shifts present in a user's grasp.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our classification algorithm and the overall system. Results show that CK-SVM
achieved superior classification accuracy on both simulated (97.1%) and
real-world (90.8%) datasets compared to four baseline models. Furthermore, a
pilot study confirmed that users more preferred the Tac-Nav tactile interface
over conventional joystick and voice-based controls.

Result: 实验结果支持假设，证明模型能有效预测物体位置。

Conclusion: FlowMaps为动态环境中的物体重定位提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Task and motion planning are long-standing challenges in robotics, especially
when robots have to deal with dynamic environments exhibiting long-term
dynamics, such as households or warehouses. In these environments, long-term
dynamics mostly stem from human activities, since previously detected objects
can be moved or removed from the scene. This adds the necessity to find such
objects again before completing the designed task, increasing the risk of
failure due to missed relocalizations. However, in these settings, the nature
of such human-object interactions is often overlooked, despite being governed
by common habits and repetitive patterns. Our conjecture is that these cues can
be exploited to recover the most likely objects' positions in the scene,
helping to address the problem of unknown relocalization in changing
environments. To this end we propose FlowMaps, a model based on Flow Matching
that is able to infer multimodal object locations over space and time. Our
results present statistical evidence to support our hypotheses, opening the way
to more complex applications of our approach. The code is publically available

Result: 实验表明STAF在多机器人导航中表现出色，能有效应对挑战性场景。

Conclusion: STAF为多机器人导航提供了动态分队和自适应编队的新能力。

Abstract: Coordinated multi-robot navigation is essential for robots to operate as a
team in diverse environments. During navigation, robot teams usually need to
maintain specific formations, such as circular formations to protect human
teammates at the center. However, in complex scenarios such as narrow
corridors, rigidly preserving predefined formations can become infeasible.
Therefore, robot teams must be capable of dynamically splitting into smaller
subteams and adaptively controlling the subteams to navigate through such
scenarios while preserving formations. To enable this capability, we introduce
a novel method for SubTeaming and Adaptive Formation (STAF), which is built
upon a unified hierarchical learning framework: (1) high-level deep graph cut
for team splitting, (2) intermediate-level graph learning for facilitating
coordinated navigation among subteams, and (3) low-level policy learning for
controlling individual mobile robots to reach their goal positions while
avoiding collisions. To evaluate STAF, we conducted extensive experiments in
both indoor and outdoor environments using robotics simulations and physical
robot teams. Experimental results show that STAF enables the novel capability
for subteaming and adaptive formation control, and achieves promising
performance in coordinated multi-robot navigation through challenging
scenarios. More details are available on the project website:

Conclusion: 分离模拟器和强化学习的方法显著提升了训练效率和实际部署效果，尤其是在基于视觉的任务中。

Abstract: This work explores techniques to scale up image-based end-to-end learning for
dexterous grasping with an arm + hand system. Unlike state-based RL,
vision-based RL is much more memory inefficient, resulting in relatively low
batch sizes, which is not amenable for algorithms like PPO. Nevertheless, it is
still an attractive method as unlike the more commonly used techniques which
distill state-based policies into vision networks, end-to-end RL can allow for
emergent active vision behaviors. We identify a key bottleneck in training
these policies is the way most existing simulators scale to multiple GPUs using
traditional data parallelism techniques. We propose a new method where we
disaggregate the simulator and RL (both training and experience buffers) onto
separate GPUs. On a node with four GPUs, we have the simulator running on three
of them, and PPO running on the fourth. We are able to show that with the same
number of GPUs, we can double the number of existing environments compared to
the previous baseline of standard data parallelism. This allows us to train
vision-based environments, end-to-end with depth, which were previously
performing far worse with the baseline. We train and distill both depth and
state-based policies into stereo RGB networks and show that depth distillation
leads to better results, both in simulation and reality. This improvement is
likely due to the observability gap between state and vision policies which
does not exist when distilling depth policies into stereo RGB. We further show
that the increased batch size brought about by disaggregated simulation also
improves real world performance. When deploying in the real world, we improve
upon the previous state-of-the-art vision-based results using our end-to-end
policies.

Abstract: Enabling robotic assistants to navigate complex environments and locate
objects described in free-form language is a critical capability for real-world
deployment. While foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), offer powerful semantic understanding, effectively adapting their
web-scale knowledge for embodied decision-making remains a key challenge. We
present FiLM-Nav (Fine-tuned Language Model for Navigation), an approach that
directly fine-tunes pre-trained VLM as the navigation policy. In contrast to
methods that use foundation models primarily in a zero-shot manner or for map
annotation, FiLM-Nav learns to select the next best exploration frontier by
conditioning directly on raw visual trajectory history and the navigation goal.
Leveraging targeted simulated embodied experience allows the VLM to ground its
powerful pre-trained representations in the specific dynamics and visual
patterns relevant to goal-driven navigation. Critically, fine-tuning on a
diverse data mixture combining ObjectNav, OVON, ImageNav, and an auxiliary
spatial reasoning task proves essential for achieving robustness and broad
generalization. FiLM-Nav sets a new state-of-the-art in both SPL and success
rate on HM3D ObjectNav among open-vocabulary methods, and sets a
state-of-the-art SPL on the challenging HM3D-OVON benchmark, demonstrating
strong generalization to unseen object categories. Our work validates that
directly fine-tuning VLMs on diverse simulated embodied data is a highly
effective pathway towards generalizable and efficient semantic navigation
capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的方法论，用于设计和评估并联踝关节机构，通过多目标优化和性能指标比较，优化后的RSU架构显著优于传统设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人踝关节设计对地面交互的安全性和效率至关重要，但现有并联机构的选择受限于执行器可用性和任务需求。

Method: 采用多目标优化合成机构几何形状，并通过标量成本函数评估性能指标，重点研究了SPU和RSU两种架构。

Result: 优化后的RSU设计比原始串行设计和传统RSU分别降低了41%和14%的成本函数。

Conclusion: 提出的方法论有效优化了并联踝关节设计，RSU架构在性能上表现最佳。

Abstract: The design of the humanoid ankle is critical for safe and efficient ground
interaction. Key factors such as mechanical compliance and motor mass
distribution have driven the adoption of parallel mechanism architectures.
However, selecting the optimal configuration depends on both actuator
availability and task requirements. We propose a unified methodology for the
design and evaluation of parallel ankle mechanisms. A multi-objective
optimization synthesizes the mechanism geometry, the resulting solutions are
evaluated using a scalar cost function that aggregates key performance metrics
for cross-architecture comparison. We focus on two representative
architectures: the Spherical-Prismatic-Universal (SPU) and the
Revolute-Spherical-Universal (RSU). For both, we resolve the kinematics, and
for the RSU, introduce a parameterization that ensures workspace feasibility
and accelerates optimization. We validate our approach by redesigning the ankle
of an existing humanoid robot. The optimized RSU consistently outperforms both
the original serial design and a conventionally engineered RSU, reducing the
cost function by up to 41% and 14%, respectively.

*Pranav Tiwari,Soumyodipta Nath*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间位移的领导者-跟随者控制策略（Robot Conga），用于解决多智能体系统中的顺序路径跟随问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖时间参数化轨迹和路径积分，可能导致同步问题和行为僵化。

Method: 通过领导者的空间位移更新每个智能体的期望状态，假设存在全局位置参考。

Result: 在仿真中验证了算法，实现了精确的轨迹跟踪、稳定的间距和快速收敛。

Conclusion: Robot Conga在多智能体路径跟随中表现出色，适用于室内环境。

Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in
robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and
collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely
on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in
synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem
of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation
along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We
introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each
agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than
time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in
indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB
localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both
TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate
trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all
agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped
case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于并发进程演算的方法，用于独立于底层时序验证机器人群体设计的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式系统中由于时序不可预测性导致的元状态错误难以通过经验验证，机器人群体中问题更复杂。

Result: 在仿真和现实中验证了方法的有效性，纠正后群体行为一致正确。

Conclusion: 该方法可跨设计方法转移，为机器人学提供了形式化工具。

Abstract: Emergent properties in distributed systems arise due to timing
unpredictability; asynchronous state evolution within each sub-system may lead
the macro-system to faulty meta-states. Empirical validation of correctness is
often prohibitively expensive, as the size of the state-space is too large to
be tractable. In robotic swarms this problem is exacerbated, when compared to
software systems, by the variability of the implementation substrate across the
design, or even the deployment, process. We present an approach for formally
reasoning about the correctness of robotic swarm design in a
substrate-timing-independent way. By leveraging concurrent process calculi
(namely, Communicating Sequential Processes), we introduce a methodology that
can automatically identify possible causes of faulty meta-states and correct
such designs such that meta-states are consistently stable, even in the
presence of timing variability due to substrate changes. We evaluate this
approach on a robotic swarm with a clearly identified fault, realized in both
simulation and reality. Results support the research hypothesis, showing that
the swarm reaches an illegal meta-state before the correction is applied, but
behaves consistently correctly after the correction. Our techniques are
transferable across different design methodologies, contributing to the toolbox
of formal methods for roboticists.

Method: 使用3DStructureFormer生成伪点云特征，并与2D编码器输出特征融合，设计了伪点云编码器保留几何结构。

Result: 在多种任务中验证，性能接近3D点云方法，无需实际点云数据。

Conclusion: NoReal3D框架有效解决了3D点云数据获取成本高的问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Recently,vision-based robotic manipulation has garnered significant attention
and witnessed substantial advancements. 2D image-based and 3D point cloud-based
policy learning represent two predominant paradigms in the field, with recent
studies showing that the latter consistently outperforms the former in terms of
both policy performance and generalization, thereby underscoring the value and
significance of 3D information. However, 3D point cloud-based approaches face
the significant challenge of high data acquisition costs, limiting their
scalability and real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework NoReal3D: which introduces the 3DStructureFormer, a learnable
3D perception module capable of transforming monocular images into
geometrically meaningful pseudo-point cloud features, effectively fused with
the 2D encoder output features. Specially, the generated pseudo-point clouds
retain geometric and topological structures so we design a pseudo-point cloud
encoder to preserve these properties, making it well-suited for our framework.
We also investigate the effectiveness of different feature fusion
strategies.Our framework enhances the robot's understanding of 3D spatial
structures while completely eliminating the substantial costs associated with
3D point cloud acquisition.Extensive experiments across various tasks validate
that our framework can achieve performance comparable to 3D point cloud-based
methods, without the actual point cloud data.

TL;DR: TranTac是一种低成本、数据高效触觉传感框架，结合6轴IMU和Transformer编码器，提升机器人精细插入任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉感知在精细插入任务中不足，触觉传感能弥补这一缺陷，但现有方案或灵敏度不足或数据需求高。

Method: 集成6轴IMU于夹爪弹性尖端，结合Transformer编码器和扩散策略，模仿人类插入行为。

Result: 在视觉辅助下，平均成功率79%；纯触觉任务成功率88%；泛化测试成功率近70%。

Conclusion: TranTac为精细操作任务提供了新的触觉传感解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks such as inserting a key into a lock or plugging a
USB device into a port can fail when visual perception is insufficient to
detect misalignment. In these situations, touch sensing is crucial for the
robot to monitor the task's states and make precise, timely adjustments.
Current touch sensing solutions are either insensitive to detect subtle changes
or demand excessive sensor data. Here, we introduce TranTac, a data-efficient
and low-cost tactile sensing and control framework that integrates a single
contact-sensitive 6-axis inertial measurement unit within the elastomeric tips
of a robotic gripper for completing fine insertion tasks. Our customized
sensing system can detect dynamic translational and torsional deformations at
the micrometer scale, enabling the tracking of visually imperceptible pose
changes of the grasped object. By leveraging transformer-based encoders and
diffusion policy, TranTac can imitate human insertion behaviors using transient
tactile cues detected at the gripper's tip during insertion processes. These
cues enable the robot to dynamically control and correct the 6-DoF pose of the
grasped object. When combined with vision, TranTac achieves an average success
rate of 79% on object grasping and insertion tasks, outperforming both
vision-only policy and the one augmented with end-effector 6D force/torque
sensing. Contact localization performance is also validated through
tactile-only misaligned insertion tasks, achieving an average success rate of
88%. We assess the generalizability by training TranTac on a single prism-slot
pair and testing it on unseen data, including a USB plug and a metal key, and
find that the insertion tasks can still be completed with an average success
rate of nearly 70%. The proposed framework may inspire new robotic tactile
sensing systems for delicate manipulation tasks.

Result: 实验验证了高规划可靠性、长序列装配任务的鲁棒性能，以及对多样和扰动条件的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Video-to-BT框架通过结合认知规划和反应控制，显著提升了装配系统的灵活性和可靠性。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing demands robotic assembly systems with enhanced
flexibility and reliability. However, traditional approaches often rely on
programming tailored to each product by experts for fixed settings, which are
inherently inflexible to product changes and lack the robustness to handle
variations. As Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robotics for their
modularity and reactivity, we propose a novel hierarchical framework,
Video-to-BT, that seamlessly integrates high-level cognitive planning with
low-level reactive control, with BTs serving both as the structured output of
planning and as the governing structure for execution. Our approach leverages a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to decompose human demonstration videos into
subtasks, from which Behavior Trees are generated. During the execution, the
planned BTs combined with real-time scene interpretation enable the system to
operate reactively in the dynamic environment, while VLM-driven replanning is
triggered upon execution failure. This closed-loop architecture ensures
stability and adaptivity. We validate our framework on real-world assembly
tasks through a series of experiments, demonstrating high planning reliability,
robust performance in long-horizon assembly tasks, and strong generalization
across diverse and perturbed conditions. Project website:

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，地面机器人和四旋翼飞行器的成功率和泛化能力优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能近似恢复最大安全集，并避免与观测到的故障集相交，提升了安全性和适应性。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been demonstrated as an effective
method for safety-critical control of autonomous systems. Although CBFs are
simple to deploy, their design remains challenging, motivating the development
of learning-based approaches. Yet, issues such as suboptimal safe sets,
applicability in partially observable environments, and lack of rigorous safety
guarantees persist. In this work, we propose observation-conditioned neural
CBFs based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which approximately
recover the maximal safe sets. We exploit certain mathematical properties of
the HJ value function, ensuring that the predicted safe set never intersects
with the observed failure set. Moreover, we leverage a hypernetwork-based
architecture that is particularly suitable for the design of
observation-conditioned safety filters. The proposed method is examined both in
simulation and hardware experiments for a ground robot and a quadcopter. The
results show improved success rates and generalization to out-of-domain
environments compared to the baselines.

Result: 在标准RL基准测试中，LLM-TALE在样本效率和成功率上优于基线方法，并展示了零样本仿真到现实的迁移潜力。

Conclusion: LLM-TALE通过结合LLM规划和RL探索，有效提升了机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for robotic manipulation,
but it can suffer from low sample efficiency and requires extensive exploration
of large state-action spaces. Recent methods leverage the commonsense knowledge
and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to guide exploration
toward more meaningful states. However, LLMs can produce plans that are
semantically plausible yet physically infeasible, yielding unreliable behavior.
We introduce LLM-TALE, a framework that uses LLMs' planning to directly steer
RL exploration. LLM-TALE integrates planning at both the task level and the
affordance level, improving learning efficiency by directing agents toward
semantically meaningful actions. Unlike prior approaches that assume optimal
LLM-generated plans or rewards, LLM-TALE corrects suboptimality online and
explores multimodal affordance-level plans without human supervision. We
evaluate LLM-TALE on pick-and-place tasks in standard RL benchmarks, observing
improvements in both sample efficiency and success rates over strong baselines.

Result: 在仿真和实际实验中，VMS能准确模仿动态技能，保持长时间稳定，并泛化到未见过的运动。

Conclusion: VMS为多功能人形机器人全身控制提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Learning versatile whole-body skills by tracking various human motions is a
fundamental step toward general-purpose humanoid robots. This task is
particularly challenging because a single policy must master a broad repertoire
of motion skills while ensuring stability over long-horizon sequences. To this
end, we present VMS, a unified whole-body controller that enables humanoid
robots to learn diverse and dynamic behaviors within a single policy. Our
framework integrates a hybrid tracking objective that balances local motion
fidelity with global trajectory consistency, and an Orthogonal
Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that encourages skill specialization
while enhancing generalization across motions. A segment-level tracking reward
is further introduced to relax rigid step-wise matching, enhancing robustness
when handling global displacements and transient inaccuracies. We validate VMS
extensively in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating
accurate imitation of dynamic skills, stable performance over minute-long
sequences, and strong generalization to unseen motions. These results highlight
the potential of VMS as a scalable foundation for versatile humanoid whole-body
control. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 改进方法有效解决了边界框标注中的假阳性问题。

Abstract: The CARLA simulator (Car Learning to Act) serves as a robust platform for
testing algorithms and generating datasets in the field of Autonomous Driving
(AD). It provides control over various environmental parameters, enabling
thorough evaluation. Development bounding boxes are commonly utilized tools in
deep learning and play a crucial role in AD applications. The predominant
method for data generation in the CARLA Simulator involves identifying and
delineating objects of interest, such as vehicles, using bounding boxes. The
operation in CARLA entails capturing the coordinates of all objects on the map,
which are subsequently aligned with the sensor's coordinate system at the ego
vehicle and then enclosed within bounding boxes relative to the ego vehicle's
perspective. However, this primary approach encounters challenges associated
with object detection and bounding box annotation, such as ghost boxes.
Although these procedures are generally effective at detecting vehicles and
other objects within their direct line of sight, they may also produce false
positives by identifying objects that are obscured by obstructions. We have
enhanced the primary approach with the objective of filtering out unwanted
boxes. Performance analysis indicates that the improved approach has achieved
high accuracy.

Conclusion: SMART-3D适合实时机载应用。

Abstract: This paper presents SMART-3D, an extension of the SMART algorithm to 3D
environments. SMART-3D is a tree-based adaptive replanning algorithm for
dynamic environments with fast moving obstacles. SMART-3D morphs the underlying
tree to find a new path in real-time whenever the current path is blocked by
obstacles. SMART-3D removed the grid decomposition requirement of the SMART
algorithm by replacing the concept of hot-spots with that of hot-nodes, thus
making it computationally efficient and scalable to 3D environments. The
hot-nodes are nodes which allow for efficient reconnections to morph the
existing tree to find a new safe and reliable path. The performance of SMART-3D
is evaluated by extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments populated with
randomly moving dynamic obstacles. The results show that SMART-3D achieves high
success rates and low replanning times, thus highlighting its suitability for
real-time onboard applications.

Result: 在低数据情况下性能提升15%，在分布偏移下鲁棒性提升40%。

Conclusion: FDP为实际部署提供了更安全、更鲁棒的扩散策略替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been extensively leveraged for learning robot skills
from demonstrations. These policies are conditioned on several observational
modalities such as proprioception, vision and tactile. However, observational
modalities have varying levels of influence for different tasks that diffusion
polices fail to capture. In this work, we propose 'Factorized Diffusion
Policies' abbreviated as FDP, a novel policy formulation that enables
observational modalities to have differing influence on the action diffusion
process by design. This results in learning policies where certain observations
modalities can be prioritized over the others such as $\texttt{vision>tactile}$
or $\texttt{proprioception>vision}$. FDP achieves modality prioritization by
factorizing the observational conditioning for diffusion process, resulting in
more performant and robust policies. Our factored approach shows strong
performance improvements in low-data regimes with $15\%$ absolute improvement
in success rate on several simulated benchmarks when compared to a standard
diffusion policy that jointly conditions on all input modalities. Moreover, our
benchmark and real-world experiments show that factored policies are naturally
more robust with $40\%$ higher absolute success rate across several visuomotor
tasks under distribution shifts such as visual distractors or camera
occlusions, where existing diffusion policies fail catastrophically. FDP thus
offers a safer and more robust alternative to standard diffusion policies for
real-world deployment. Videos are available at

Motivation: 机器人学习面临数据稀缺的挑战，尤其是在触觉感知（数据稀疏）和康复机器人（数据量少）领域。

Method: 在触觉感知领域，采用无模型强化学习；在康复机器人领域，结合半监督学习、元学习和生成式AI方法。

Result: 开发了能够高效利用稀疏触觉数据的策略，以及在少量数据下实现意图推断的算法。

Conclusion: 通过不同领域的案例研究，展示了如何应对机器人学习中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Unlike in language or vision, one of the fundamental challenges in robot
learning is the lack of access to vast data resources. We can further break
down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation
and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will
discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2)
rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity,
respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but
tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical
world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of
contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only
exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning
to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand,
rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the
significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at
scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical
school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand
orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and
uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the
orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment.
My work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with
minimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI
methods.

Abstract: The ability of social robots to respond to human emotions is crucial for
building trust and acceptance in human-robot collaborative environments.
However, developing such capabilities through online reinforcement learning is
sometimes impractical due to the prohibitive cost of data collection and the
risk of generating unsafe behaviors. In this paper, we study the use of offline
reinforcement learning as a practical and efficient alternative. This technique
uses pre-collected data to enable emotion-adaptive social robots. We present a
system architecture that integrates multimodal sensing and recognition,
decision-making, and adaptive responses. Using a limited dataset from a
human-robot game-playing scenario, we establish a benchmark for comparing
offline reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require an online
environment. Our results show that BCQ and CQL are more robust to data
sparsity, achieving higher state-action values compared to NFQ, DQN, and DDQN.
This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in
emotion-adaptive robotics and informs future deployment in real-world HRI. Our
findings provide empirical insight into the performance of offline

TL;DR: HOGraspFlow是一种基于RGB图像的多模态抓取生成方法，无需显式几何先验，通过流匹配技术实现高保真抓取合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张RGB图像生成多模态可执行抓取的问题，避免依赖显式几何先验。

Method: 结合手重建和视觉基础模型，利用流匹配技术（FM）合成SE(3)抓取位姿，基于RGB特征、手-物体接触重建和抓取类型分类先验。

Result: 在真实实验中，平均成功率超过83%，优于基于扩散的变体（HOGraspDiff）。

Conclusion: HOGraspFlow展示了无需显式接触输入或物体几何的高保真抓取合成能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose Hand-Object\emph{(HO)GraspFlow}, an affordance-centric approach
that retargets a single RGB with hand-object interaction (HOI) into multi-modal
executable parallel jaw grasps without explicit geometric priors on target
objects. Building on foundation models for hand reconstruction and vision, we
synthesize $SE(3)$ grasp poses with denoising flow matching (FM), conditioned
on the following three complementary cues: RGB foundation features as visual
semantics, HOI contact reconstruction, and taxonomy-aware prior on grasp types.
Our approach demonstrates high fidelity in grasp synthesis without explicit HOI
contact input or object geometry, while maintaining strong contact and taxonomy
recognition. Another controlled comparison shows that \emph{HOGraspFlow}
consistently outperforms diffusion-based variants (\emph{HOGraspDiff}),
achieving high distributional fidelity and more stable optimization in $SE(3)$.
We demonstrate a reliable, object-agnostic grasp synthesis from human
demonstrations in real-world experiments, where an average success rate of over
$83\%$ is achieved.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: End2Race是一种用于F1Tenth自动驾驶赛车的新型端到端模仿学习算法，通过GRU架构和LiDAR数据处理实现高效决策，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶赛车需要快速决策和高性能算法，传统方法难以满足需求，因此提出End2Race。

Method: 采用GRU架构捕捉时间依赖，使用sigmoid归一化处理LiDAR数据，实现高效训练和推理。

Result: 在2400次超车场景中安全率达94.2%，超车成功率59.2%，推理时间小于0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: End2Race在F1Tenth平台上表现优异，成为领先解决方案。

Abstract: F1Tenth is a widely adopted reduced-scale platform for developing and testing
autonomous racing algorithms, hosting annual competitions worldwide. With high
operating speeds, dynamic environments, and head-to-head interactions,
autonomous racing requires algorithms that diverge from those in classical
autonomous driving. Training such algorithms is particularly challenging: the
need for rapid decision-making at high speeds severely limits model capacity.
To address this, we propose End2Race, a novel end-to-end imitation learning
algorithm designed for head-to-head autonomous racing. End2Race leverages a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture to capture continuous temporal
dependencies, enabling both short-term responsiveness and long-term strategic
planning. We also adopt a sigmoid-based normalization function that transforms
raw LiDAR scans into spatial pressure tokens, facilitating effective model
training and convergence. The algorithm is extremely efficient, achieving an
inference time of less than 0.5 milliseconds on a consumer-class GPU.
Experiments in the F1Tenth simulator demonstrate that End2Race achieves a 94.2%
safety rate across 2,400 overtaking scenarios, each with an 8-second time
limit, and successfully completes overtakes in 59.2% of cases. This surpasses
previous methods and establishes ours as a leading solution for the F1Tenth
racing testbed. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人机交互方法缺乏实时自适应界面，导致决策速度慢、认知负荷高且命令灵活性受限。

Method: 系统整合了四个LLM模块（上下文生成器、意图识别、任务规划器和模态选择器），通过三层架构实现动态交互界面。

Result: 初步评估显示，SwarmChat能准确解析上下文、识别意图并高效传递命令，用户满意度高。

Conclusion: SwarmChat通过多模态自然语言交互优化了机器人集群控制的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Traditional Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) methods often lack intuitive
real-time adaptive interfaces, making decision making slower and increasing
cognitive load while limiting command flexibility. To solve this, we present
SwarmChat, a context-aware, multimodal interaction system powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs). SwarmChat enables users to issue natural language
commands to robotic swarms using multiple modalities, such as text, voice, or
teleoperation. The system integrates four LLM-based modules: Context Generator,
Intent Recognition, Task Planner, and Modality Selector. These modules
collaboratively generate context from keywords, detect user intent, adapt
commands based on real-time robot state, and suggest optimal communication
modalities. Its three-layer architecture offers a dynamic interface with both
fixed and customizable command options, supporting flexible control while
optimizing cognitive effort. The preliminary evaluation also shows that the
SwarmChat's LLM modules provide accurate context interpretation, relevant
intent recognition, and effective command delivery, achieving high user
satisfaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受动物智能的行动感知能力启发，研究旨在解决机器人在未知非结构化环境中因物理交互不确定性导致的运动失败问题。

Method: 通过拓扑化工作空间，构建感知-动作循环，利用不动点理论和Hausdorff距离计算收敛的空间状态，并通过能量梯度实时计算实现动作规划。

Result: 实验证明I-MP在复杂杂乱环境中具有实用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: I-MP框架通过想象空间状态有效提升了机器人的动作可靠性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Humans and animals can make real-time adjustments to movements by imagining
their action outcomes to prevent unanticipated or even catastrophic motion
failures in unknown unstructured environments. Action imagination, as a refined
sensorimotor strategy, leverages perception-action loops to handle physical
interaction-induced uncertainties in perception and system modeling within
complex systems. Inspired by the action-awareness capability of animal
intelligence, this study proposes an imagination-inspired motion planner (I-MP)
framework that specifically enhances robots' action reliability by imagining
plausible spatial states for approaching. After topologizing the workspace,
I-MP build perception-action loop enabling robots autonomously build contact
models. Leveraging fixed-point theory and Hausdorff distance, the planner
computes convergent spatial states under interaction characteristics and
mission constraints. By homogenously representing multi-dimensional
environmental characteristics through work, the robot can approach the imagined
spatial states via real-time computation of energy gradients. Consequently,
experimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of I-MP in
complex cluttered environments.

Result: 给出了k=1到4的k-IV-TIP解法，以及1-IV-TBP的立方插值解法，数值结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法能够有效解决高阶导数约束下的刚体运动插值问题，为轨迹生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: The problem of interpolating a rigid body motion is to find a spatial
trajectory between a prescribed initial and terminal pose. Two variants of this
interpolation problem are addressed. The first is to find a solution that
satisfies initial conditions on the k-1 derivatives of the rigid body twist.
This is called the kth-order initial value trajectory interpolation problem
(k-IV-TIP). The second is to find a solution that satisfies conditions on the
rigid body twist and its k-1 derivatives at the initial and terminal pose. This
is called the kth-order boundary value trajectory interpolation problem
(k-BV-TIP). Solutions to the k-IV-TIP for k=1,...,4, i.e. the initial twist and
up to the 4th time derivative are prescribed. Further, a solution to the
1-IV-TBP is presented, i.e. the initial and terminal twist are prescribed. The
latter is a novel cubic interpolation between two spatial configurations with
given initial and terminal twist. This interpolation is automatically identical
to the minimum acceleration curve when the twists are set to zero. The general
approach to derive higher-order solutions is presented. Numerical results are
shown for two examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人装配设计依赖手动规划，效率低且难以处理复杂对象，LLM的应用潜力激发了自动化需求。

Method: 提出IDfRA框架，结合迭代规划、执行、验证和重新规划，利用自评估逐步优化设计。

Result: IDfRA在语义识别准确率达73.3%，装配成功率达86.9%，设计质量随迭代提升。

Conclusion: IDfRA通过自验证和上下文适应，展示了在非结构化制造场景中的潜力。

Abstract: As robots proliferate in manufacturing, Design for Robotic Assembly (DfRA),
which is designing products for efficient automated assembly, is increasingly
important. Traditional approaches to DfRA rely on manual planning, which is
time-consuming, expensive and potentially impractical for complex objects.
Large language models (LLM) have exhibited proficiency in semantic
interpretation and robotic task planning, stimulating interest in their
application to the automation of DfRA. But existing methodologies typically
rely on heuristic strategies and rigid, hard-coded physics simulators that may
not translate into real-world assembly contexts. In this work, we present
Iterative Design for Robotic Assembly (IDfRA), a framework using iterative
cycles of planning, execution, verification, and re-planning, each informed by
self-assessment, to progressively enhance design quality within a fixed yet
initially under-specified environment, thereby eliminating the physics
simulation with the real world itself. The framework accepts as input a target
structure together with a partial environmental representation. Through
successive refinement, it converges toward solutions that reconcile semantic
fidelity with physical feasibility. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
IDfRA attains 73.3\% top-1 accuracy in semantic recognisability, surpassing the
baseline on this metric. Moreover, the resulting assembly plans exhibit robust
physical feasibility, achieving an overall 86.9\% construction success rate,
with design quality improving across iterations, albeit not always
monotonically. Pairwise human evaluation further corroborates the advantages of
IDfRA relative to alternative approaches. By integrating self-verification with
context-aware adaptation, the framework evidences strong potential for
deployment in unstructured manufacturing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，输入与状态依赖项非线性耦合，导致计算成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用隐式广义动量状态空间表示，分离线性驱动通道与状态依赖动态，仅需学习非驱动动态。

Result: 提出的线性模型在预测性能上优于传统双线性模型，且更高效。

Conclusion: 结合线性GESO，框架在机器人操作器上验证了高精度、鲁棒性和学习效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman operator formulation for Euler Lagrangian
dynamics that employs an implicit generalized momentum-based state space
representation, which decouples a known linear actuation channel from state
dependent dynamics and makes the system more amenable to linear Koopman
modeling. By leveraging this structural separation, the proposed formulation
only requires to learn the unactuated dynamics rather than the complete
actuation dependent system, thereby significantly reducing the number of
learnable parameters, improving data efficiency, and lowering overall model
complexity. In contrast, conventional explicit formulations inherently couple
inputs with the state dependent terms in a nonlinear manner, making them more
suitable for bilinear Koopman models, which are more computationally expensive
to train and deploy. Notably, the proposed scheme enables the formulation of
linear models that achieve superior prediction performance compared to
conventional bilinear models while remaining substantially more efficient. To
realize this framework, we present two neural network architectures that
construct Koopman embeddings from actuated or unactuated data, enabling
flexible and efficient modeling across different tasks. Robustness is ensured
through the integration of a linear Generalized Extended State Observer (GESO),
which explicitly estimates disturbances and compensates for them in real time.
The combined momentum-based Koopman and GESO framework is validated through
comprehensive trajectory tracking simulations and experiments on robotic
manipulators, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and learning
efficiency relative to state of the art alternatives.

Conclusion: OGR框架通过多智能体协作和VLM能力，实现了高效、自动化的自动驾驶策略学习。

Abstract: The advancement of foundation models fosters new initiatives for policy
learning in achieving safe and efficient autonomous driving. However, a
critical bottleneck lies in the manual engineering of reward functions and
training curricula for complex and dynamic driving tasks, which is a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose
OGR (Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect), a novel automated driving policy learning
framework that leverages vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent
collaboration. Our framework capitalizes on advanced reasoning and multimodal
understanding capabilities of VLMs to construct a hierarchical agent system.
Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives,
while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for
efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then
facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore,
a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of
long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation
process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop
technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient
multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables
the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire
interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator
demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct
urban scenarios, and strong compatibility with various RL algorithms. Further
real-world experiments highlight the practical viability and effectiveness of
our framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.

Motivation: 解决现有模仿学习策略缺乏力感知和力/扭矩传感器成本高的问题。

Method: 结合Transformer-based IL策略和阻抗控制的双环结构，使用关节扭矩测量和数字孪生进行力估计。

Result: FILIC在实验中显著优于仅视觉和基于关节扭矩的方法，实现更安全、更柔顺的操作。

Conclusion: FILIC提供了一种低成本、高效的力感知机器人操作解决方案。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation is crucial for robots to perform tasks requiring
precise force control, such as insertion, assembly, and in-hand manipulation.
However, most imitation learning (IL) policies remain position-centric and lack
explicit force awareness, and adding force/torque sensors to collaborative
robot arms is often costly and requires additional hardware design. To overcome
these issues, we propose FILIC, a Force-guided Imitation Learning framework
with impedance torque control. FILIC integrates a Transformer-based IL policy
with an impedance controller in a dual-loop structure, enabling compliant
force-informed, force-executed manipulation. For robots without force/torque
sensors, we introduce a cost-effective end-effector force estimator using joint
torque measurements through analytical Jacobian-based inversion while
compensating with model-predicted torques from a digital twin. We also design
complementary force feedback frameworks via handheld haptics and VR
visualization to improve demonstration quality. Experiments show that FILIC
significantly outperforms vision-only and joint-torque-based methods, achieving
safer, more compliant, and adaptable contact-rich manipulation. Our code can be

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中，CoPlanner在安全和舒适性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoPlanner通过联合建模和应急感知设计，提升了自动驾驶在不确定性环境中的鲁棒性和交互真实性。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction and motion planning are crucial for autonomous
driving systems to navigate safely in complex, interactive environments
characterized by multimodal uncertainties. However, current
generation-then-evaluation frameworks typically construct multiple plausible
trajectory hypotheses but ultimately adopt a single most likely outcome,
leading to overconfident decisions and a lack of fallback strategies that are
vital for safety in rare but critical scenarios. Moreover, the usual decoupling
of prediction and planning modules could result in socially inconsistent or
unrealistic joint trajectories, especially in highly interactive traffic. To
address these challenges, we propose a contingency-aware diffusion planner
(CoPlanner), a unified framework that jointly models multi-agent interactive
trajectory generation and contingency-aware motion planning. Specifically, the
pivot-conditioned diffusion mechanism anchors trajectory sampling on a
validated, shared short-term segment to preserve temporal consistency, while
stochastically generating diverse long-horizon branches that capture multimodal
motion evolutions. In parallel, we design a contingency-aware multi-scenario
scoring strategy that evaluates candidate ego trajectories across multiple
plausible long-horizon evolution scenarios, balancing safety, progress, and
comfort. This integrated design preserves feasible fallback options and
enhances robustness under uncertainty, leading to more realistic
interaction-aware planning. Extensive closed-loop experiments on the nuPlan
benchmark demonstrate that CoPlanner consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on both Val14 and Test14 datasets, achieving significant improvements
in safety and comfort under both reactive and non-reactive settings. Code and
model will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在仿真和现实实验中表现优于现有最优策略。

Conclusion: Imagine2Act通过语义和几何推理实现了高精度操作任务的高效解决。

Abstract: Relational object rearrangement (ROR) tasks (e.g., insert flower to vase)
require a robot to manipulate objects with precise semantic and geometric
reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on pre-collected demonstrations that
struggle to capture complex geometric constraints or generate goal-state
observations to capture semantic and geometric knowledge, but fail to
explicitly couple object transformation with action prediction, resulting in
errors due to generative noise. To address these limitations, we propose
Imagine2Act, a 3D imitation-learning framework that incorporates semantic and
geometric constraints of objects into policy learning to tackle high-precision
manipulation tasks. We first generate imagined goal images conditioned on
language instructions and reconstruct corresponding 3D point clouds to provide
robust semantic and geometric priors. These imagined goal point clouds serve as
additional inputs to the policy model, while an object-action consistency
strategy with soft pose supervision explicitly aligns predicted end-effector
motion with generated object transformation. This design enables Imagine2Act to
reason about semantic and geometric relationships between objects and predict
accurate actions across diverse tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the
real world demonstrate that Imagine2Act outperforms previous state-of-the-art
policies. More visualizations can be found at

Motivation: 现有方法在处理重复状态或长时依赖时表现不足，需要更高效且多样化的记忆表示。

Method: 通过点跟踪抽象过去观察，形成紧凑且结构化的对象级历史表示，可无缝集成到各种视觉运动策略中。

Result: 在多样化操作任务中表现优异，显著优于马尔可夫基线和现有历史方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了多种记忆需求，提升了任务性能和决策准确性。

Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require memory beyond the current observation, yet
most visuomotor policies rely on the Markov assumption and thus struggle with
repeated states or long-horizon dependencies. Existing methods attempt to
extend observation horizons but remain insufficient for diverse memory
requirements. To this end, we propose an object-centric history representation
based on point tracking, which abstracts past observations into a compact and
structured form that retains only essential task-relevant information. Tracked
points are encoded and aggregated at the object level, yielding a compact
history representation that can be seamlessly integrated into various
visuomotor policies. Our design provides full history-awareness with high
computational efficiency, leading to improved overall task performance and
decision accuracy. Through extensive evaluations on diverse manipulation tasks,
we show that our method addresses multiple facets of memory requirements - such
as task stage identification, spatial memorization, and action counting, as
well as longer-term demands like continuous and pre-loaded memory - and
consistently outperforms both Markovian baselines and prior history-based
approaches. Project website: http://tonyfang.net/history

Abstract: This article presents a novel multi-agent spatial transformer (MAST) for
learning communication policies in large-scale decentralized and collaborative
multi-robot systems (DC-MRS). Challenges in collaboration in DC-MRS arise from:
(i) partial observable states as robots make only localized perception, (ii)
limited communication range with no central server, and (iii) independent
execution of actions. The robots need to optimize a common task-specific
objective, which, under the restricted setting, must be done using a
communication policy that exhibits the desired collaborative behavior. The
proposed MAST is a decentralized transformer architecture that learns
communication policies to compute abstract information to be shared with other
agents and processes the received information with the robot's own
observations. The MAST extends the standard transformer with new positional
encoding strategies and attention operations that employ windowing to limit the
receptive field for MRS. These are designed for local computation,
shift-equivariance, and permutation equivariance, making it a promising
approach for DC-MRS. We demonstrate the efficacy of MAST on decentralized
assignment and navigation (DAN) and decentralized coverage control. Efficiently
trained using imitation learning in a centralized setting, the decentralized
MAST policy is robust to communication delays, scales to large teams, and
performs better than the baselines and other learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供全局最优解，还可作为局部搜索方法的初始化，进一步降低定位误差至130米。

Abstract: To provide backup and augmentation to global navigation satellite system
(GNSS), Doppler shift from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can be employed as
signals of opportunity (SOP) for position, navigation and timing (PNT). Since
the Doppler positioning problem is non-convex, local searching methods may
produce two types of estimates: a global optimum without notice or a local
optimum given an inexact initial estimate. As exact initialization is
unavailable in some unknown environments, a guaranteed global optimization
method in no need of initialization becomes necessary. To achieve this goal, we
propose a certifiably optimal LEO Doppler positioning method by utilizing
convex optimization. In this paper, the certifiable positioning method is
implemented through a graduated weight approximation (GWA) algorithm and
semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. To guarantee the optimality, we
derive the necessary conditions for optimality in ideal noiseless cases and
sufficient noise bounds conditions in noisy cases. Simulation and real tests
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method. Specially, the real test using Iridium-NEXT satellites shows that the
proposed method estimates an certifiably optimal solution with an 3D

TL;DR: Ratatouille通过改进模仿学习的架构和训练方法，显著提升了社交机器人导航的安全性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在社交机器人导航中数据密集和不安全的问题，通过离线模仿学习避免碰撞风险。

Method: 提出Ratatouille管道和模型架构，优化行为克隆（BC）的训练和设计。

Result: 碰撞率降低6倍，成功率提高3倍，并在真实世界中验证。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模仿学习能显著提升社交导航的安全性和可靠性，无需额外数据。

Abstract: Scaling Reinforcement Learning to in-the-wild social robot navigation is both
data-intensive and unsafe, since policies must learn through direct interaction
and inevitably encounter collisions. Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids
these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely
offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively
applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving
strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We
present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing
the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by
3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and
the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university
campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our
findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can
substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation.

Motivation: 在机器人与人类物理交互时，安全性和性能需兼顾。弹性串联执行器（SEAs）通过引入柔性驱动提升安全性，但同时也降低了精确运动能力。

Method: 研究了不同线性控制和机械配置对SEAs的影响，重点探讨了执行器侧控制的优势，并提出了结合PD控制器和弹性传动阻尼器的方案。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，低物理刚度和高控制器增益的设计既能保证精确性能，又能确保碰撞时的用户安全。

Conclusion: 通过优化控制策略和机械设计，可以在安全性和性能之间找到平衡，为机器人与人类交互提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: When humans physically interact with robots, we need the robots to be both
safe and performant. Series elastic actuators (SEAs) fundamentally advance
safety by introducing compliant actuation. On the one hand, adding a spring
mitigates the impact of accidental collisions between human and robot; but on
the other hand, this spring introduces oscillations and fundamentally decreases
the robot's ability to perform precise, accurate motions. So how should we
trade off between physical safety and performance? In this paper, we enumerate
the different linear control and mechanical configurations for series elastic
actuators, and explore how each choice affects the rendered compliance,
passivity, and tracking performance. While prior works focus on load side
control, we find that actuator side control has significant benefits. Indeed,
simple PD controllers on the actuator side allow for a much wider range of
control gains that maintain safety, and combining these with a damper in the
elastic transmission yields high performance. Our simulations and real world
experiments suggest that, by designing a system with low physical stiffness and
high controller gains, this solution enables accurate performance while also
ensuring user safety during collisions.

Abstract: Self-driving cars operate in constantly changing environments and are exposed
to a variety of uncertainties and disturbances. These factors render classical
controllers ineffective, especially for lateral control. Therefore, an adaptive
MPC controller is designed in this paper for the path tracking task, tuned by
an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Online parameter adaptation
is performed using Neural Networks and ANFIS. The designed controller showed
promising results compared to standard MPC in triple lane change and trajectory
tracking scenarios. Code can be found here:

Conclusion: MADP通过扩散模型实现了高效的群体协作，展示了在复杂任务中的潜力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose MADP, a novel diffusion-model-based approach for collaboration in
decentralized robot swarms. MADP leverages diffusion models to generate samples
from complex and high-dimensional action distributions that capture the
interdependencies between agents' actions. Each robot conditions policy
sampling on a fused representation of its own observations and perceptual
embeddings received from peers. To evaluate this approach, we task a team of
holonomic robots piloted by MADP to address coverage control-a canonical multi
agent navigation problem. The policy is trained via imitation learning from a
clairvoyant expert on the coverage control problem, with the diffusion process
parameterized by a spatial transformer architecture to enable decentralized
inference. We evaluate the system under varying numbers, locations, and
variances of importance density functions, capturing the robustness demands of
real-world coverage tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our model inherits
valuable properties from diffusion models, generalizing across agent densities
and environments, and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 3D方向表示方法多样且各有优劣，选择最佳表示方法困难，缺乏统一的文献综述和实证基准。

Method: 1) 统一整理所有3D方向表示方法及相关技巧；2) 在机器人学常见场景（直接优化、模仿学习、强化学习、轨迹优化）中进行基准测试。

Result: 提供了不同场景下的最佳3D方向表示方法建议，并开源了相关数学实现。

Conclusion: 本文填补了文献空白，提供了实用指南和参考实现，帮助研究者选择适合的3D方向表示方法。

Abstract: There exist numerous ways of representing 3D orientations. Each
representation has both limitations and unique features. Choosing the best
representation for one task is often a difficult chore, and there exist
conflicting opinions on which representation is better suited for a set of
family of tasks. Even worse, when dealing with scenarios where we need to learn
or optimize functions with orientations as inputs and/or outputs, the set of
possibilities (representations, loss functions, etc.) is even larger and it is
not easy to decide what is best for each scenario. In this paper, we attempt to
a) present clearly, concisely and with unified notation all available
representations, and "tricks" related to 3D orientations (including Lie Group
algebra), and b) benchmark them in representative scenarios. The first part
feels like it is missing from the robotics literature as one has to read many
different textbooks and papers in order have a concise and clear understanding
of all possibilities, while the benchmark is necessary in order to come up with
recommendations based on empirical evidence. More precisely, we experiment with
the following settings that attempt to cover most widely used scenarios in
robotics: 1) direct optimization, 2) imitation/supervised learning with a
neural network controller, 3) reinforcement learning, and 4) trajectory
optimization using differential dynamic programming. We finally provide
guidelines depending on the scenario, and make available a reference
implementation of all the orientation math described.

Motivation: 传统帧相机因固定帧率（30-60Hz）导致系统响应延迟，限制了实时性。

Method: 开发频域互相关框架，将事件流匹配问题转化为高效的傅里叶空间乘法，并利用事件帧的二进制特性及图像压缩技术提升计算速度。

Result: 在4000+米的室内外轨迹上实现自主导航，定位误差低于24厘米，控制更新频率远超传统系统。

Conclusion: 事件相机感知在实时机器人导航中具有实际可行性，系统性能显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Visual teach-and-repeat navigation enables robots to autonomously traverse
previously demonstrated paths by comparing current sensory input with recorded
trajectories. However, conventional frame-based cameras fundamentally limit
system responsiveness: their fixed frame rates (typically 30-60 Hz) create
inherent latency between environmental changes and control responses. Here we
present the first event-camera-based visual teach-and-repeat system. To achieve
this, we develop a frequency-domain cross-correlation framework that transforms
the event stream matching problem into computationally efficient Fourier space
multiplications, capable of exceeding 300Hz processing rates, an order of
magnitude faster than frame-based approaches. By exploiting the binary nature
of event frames and applying image compression techniques, we further enhance
the computational speed of the cross-correlation process without sacrificing
localization accuracy. Extensive experiments using a Prophesee EVK4 HD event
camera mounted on an AgileX Scout Mini robot demonstrate successful autonomous
navigation across 4000+ meters of indoor and outdoor trajectories. Our system
achieves ATEs below 24 cm while maintaining consistent high-frequency control
updates. Our evaluations show that our approach achieves substantially higher
update rates compared to conventional frame-based systems, underscoring the
practical viability of event-based perception for real-time robotic navigation.

Motivation: 当前珊瑚卵计数方法劳动密集且效率低，成为珊瑚生产流程中的瓶颈，亟需自动化解决方案。

Conclusion: CSLICS系统提升了珊瑚养殖效率，支持大规模珊瑚礁恢复以应对气候变化威胁。

Abstract: Coral aquaculture for reef restoration requires accurate and continuous spawn
counting for resource distribution and larval health monitoring, but current
methods are labor-intensive and represent a critical bottleneck in the coral
production pipeline. We propose the Coral Spawn and Larvae Imaging Camera
System (CSLICS), which uses low cost modular cameras and object detectors
trained using human-in-the-loop labeling approaches for automated spawn
counting in larval rearing tanks. This paper details the system engineering,
dataset collection, and computer vision techniques to detect, classify and
count coral spawn. Experimental results from mass spawning events demonstrate
an F1 score of 82.4\% for surface spawn detection at different embryogenesis
stages, 65.3\% F1 score for sub-surface spawn detection, and a saving of 5,720
hours of labor per spawning event compared to manual sampling methods at the
same frequency. Comparison of manual counts with CSLICS monitoring during a
mass coral spawning event on the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates CSLICS'
accurate measurement of fertilization success and sub-surface spawn counts.
These findings enhance the coral aquaculture process and enable upscaling of
coral reef restoration efforts to address climate change threats facing
ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef.

Conclusion: 该研究为利用机械臂固有动力学的轻量级电缆驱动蛇形机械臂的控制和感知策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cable-driven serpentine manipulators hold great potential in unstructured
environments, offering obstacle avoidance, multi-directional force application,
and a lightweight design. By placing all motors and sensors at the base and
employing plastic links, we can further reduce the arm's weight. To demonstrate
this concept, we developed a 9-degree-of-freedom cable-driven serpentine
manipulator with an arm length of 545 mm and a total mass of only 308 g.
However, this design introduces flexibility-induced variations, such as cable
slack, elongation, and link deformation. These variations result in
discrepancies between analytical predictions and actual link positions, making
pose estimation more challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a
physical reservoir computing based pose estimation method that exploits the
manipulator's intrinsic nonlinear dynamics as a high-dimensional reservoir.
Experimental results show a mean pose error of 4.3 mm using our method,
compared to 4.4 mm with a baseline long short-term memory network and 39.5 mm
with an analytical approach. This work provides a new direction for control and
perception strategies in lightweight cable-driven serpentine manipulators
leveraging their intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains one of the most limiting factors in driving progress in
robotics. However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing
exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization.
Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate
and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was
recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models
(VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we
propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across
diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human
embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source
foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly
underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately $70\%$ of
their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data
curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale
robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at

Abstract: Agile mapless navigation in cluttered 3D environments poses significant
challenges for autonomous drones. Conventional mapping-planning-control
pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We
present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception
and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR
point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed
"anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct
polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each
planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them
with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and
goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI
achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of
single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and
inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates
above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX
16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves
safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will
be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Dynamic in air handover is a fundamental challenge for dual-arm robots,
requiring accurate perception, precise coordination, and natural motion. Prior
methods often rely on dynamics models, strong priors, or depth sensing,
limiting generalization and naturalness. We present DyDexHandover, a novel
framework that employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to train an end to
end RGB based policy for bimanual object throwing and catching. To achieve more
human-like behavior, the throwing policy is guided by a human policy
regularization scheme, encouraging fluid and natural motion, and enhancing the
generalization capability of the policy. A dual arm simulation environment was
built in Isaac Sim for experimental evaluation. DyDexHandover achieves nearly
99 percent success on training objects and 75 percent on unseen objects, while
generating human-like throwing and catching behaviors. To our knowledge, it is
the first method to realize dual-arm in-air handover using only raw RGB
perception.

Abstract: Generating obstacle-free trajectories for robotic manipulators in
unstructured and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge.
Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort
to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations.
This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning
methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in
joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that
combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement
learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into
two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory
planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA)
model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path
searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO)
algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which
greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance
within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's
adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of
commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both
obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as
simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real)
transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex
scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and
real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments. Project page

Abstract: The complex nonlinear dynamics of hydraulic excavators, such as time delays
and control coupling, pose significant challenges to achieving high-precision
trajectory tracking. Traditional control methods often fall short in such
applications due to their inability to effectively handle these nonlinearities,
while commonly used learning-based methods require extensive interactions with
the environment, leading to inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce
EfficientTrack, a trajectory tracking method that integrates model-based
learning to manage nonlinear dynamics and leverages closed-loop dynamics to
improve learning efficiency, ultimately minimizing tracking errors. We validate
our method through comprehensive experiments both in simulation and on a
real-world excavator. Comparative experiments in simulation demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing learning-based approaches, achieving the
highest tracking precision and smoothness with the fewest interactions.
Real-world experiments further show that our method remains effective under
load conditions and possesses the ability for continual learning, highlighting
its practical applicability. For implementation details and source code, please

Abstract: Robotics and automation are key enablers to increase throughput in ongoing
conservation efforts across various threatened ecosystems. Cataloguing,
digitisation, husbandry, and similar activities require the ability to interact
with delicate, fragile samples without damaging them. Additionally,
learning-based solutions to these tasks require the ability to safely acquire
data to train manipulation policies through, e.g., reinforcement learning. To
address these twin needs, we introduce a novel method to print free-form,
highly sensorised soft 'physical twins'. We present an automated design
workflow to create complex and customisable 3D soft sensing structures on
demand from 3D scans or models. Compared to the state of the art, our soft
liquid metal sensors faithfully recreate complex natural geometries and display
excellent sensing properties suitable for validating performance in delicate
manipulation tasks. We demonstrate the application of our physical twins as
'sensing corals': high-fidelity, 3D printed replicas of scanned corals that
eliminate the need for live coral experimentation, whilst increasing data
quality, offering an ethical and scalable pathway for advancing autonomous
coral handling and soft manipulation broadly. Through extensive bench-top
manipulation and underwater grasping experiments, we show that our sensing
coral is able to detect grasps under 0.5 N, effectively capturing the delicate
interactions and light contact forces required for coral handling. Finally, we
showcase the value of our physical twins across two demonstrations: (i)
automated coral labelling for lab identification and (ii) robotic coral
aquaculture. Sensing physical twins such as ours can provide richer grasping
feedback than conventional sensors providing experimental validation of prior
to deployment in handling fragile and delicate items.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic

LiDAR-specific supervision or architectural alterations. This conversion is
achieved through a general pipeline of volumetric discretization and Truncated
Signed Distance Field (TSDF) extraction. We pair this with a highly optimized,
GPU-accelerated ray-casting module that simulates LiDAR returns at over 500
FPS. We validate our approach on indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating
exceptional geometric fidelity; By enabling the direct reuse of 3DGS assets for

### [265] [GPS Denied IBVS-Based Navigation and Collision Avoidance of UAV Using a Low-Cost RGB Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17435)
*Xiaoyu Wang,Yan Rui Tan,William Leong,Sunan Huang,Rodney Teo,Cheng Xiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB相机的图像视觉伺服（IBVS）框架，用于无人机导航和避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机导航虽被广泛研究，但在多视觉目标和避障任务中应用IBVS仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过AI单目深度估计实现避障，无需显式路径规划，系统完全在Jetson平台上运行。

Result: 实验验证了无人机在无GPS环境下能有效导航并避障。

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机提供了一种轻量且可部署的导航解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) framework for UAV
navigation and collision avoidance using only an RGB camera. While UAV
navigation has been extensively studied, it remains challenging to apply IBVS
in missions involving multiple visual targets and collision avoidance. The
proposed method achieves navigation without explicit path planning, and
collision avoidance is realized through AI-based monocular depth estimation
from RGB images. Unlike approaches that rely on stereo cameras or external
workstations, our framework runs fully onboard a Jetson platform, ensuring a
self-contained and deployable system. Experimental results validate that the
UAV can navigate across multiple AprilTags and avoid obstacles effectively in
GPS-denied environments.

TL;DR: DQ-RISE通过量化手部状态简化动作预测，同时保持关键模式，实现更平衡高效的臂-手协调学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉运动策略将臂和手动作结合在单一空间中，导致高维度手部动作主导耦合动作空间，影响臂控制。

Method: DQ-RISE量化手部状态以简化动作预测，并应用连续松弛使臂动作与紧凑手部状态联合扩散。

Result: 实验表明DQ-RISE实现了更平衡高效的学习。

Conclusion: DQ-RISE为结构化和可泛化的灵巧操作铺平了道路。

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable robots to perform complex manipulations that
require fine-grained control and adaptability. Achieving such manipulation is
challenging because the high degrees of freedom tightly couple hand and arm
motions, making learning and control difficult. Successful dexterous
manipulation relies not only on precise hand motions, but also on accurate
spatial positioning of the arm and coordinated arm-hand dynamics. However, most
existing visuomotor policies represent arm and hand actions in a single
combined space, which often causes high-dimensional hand actions to dominate
the coupled action space and compromise arm control. To address this, we
propose DQ-RISE, which quantizes hand states to simplify hand motion prediction
while preserving essential patterns, and applies a continuous relaxation that
allows arm actions to diffuse jointly with these compact hand states. This
design enables the policy to learn arm-hand coordination from data while
preventing hand actions from overwhelming the action space. Experiments show
that DQ-RISE achieves more balanced and efficient learning, paving the way
toward structured and generalizable dexterous manipulation. Project website:

TL;DR: 研究通过简单反馈策略（曲率比例驱动）对软体机器人形状的影响，分析传感器和驱动器限制下的形态不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软体机器人形状控制的复杂性源于几何非线性、建模误差及传感/驱动限制，需探索简单反馈策略的效果。

Method: 将软体机器人建模为弹性体，使用比例反馈策略，研究传感器和驱动器有限数量对形状控制的影响。

Result: 发现形态不稳定性与重力弯曲数、反馈增益和滤波器宽度相关，最优驱动增益可最小化形状误差。

Conclusion: 模型为有限传感/驱动能力的软体机器人设计提供了定量分析工具。

Abstract: The morphology of a slender soft-robot can be modified by sensing its shape
via sensors and exerting moments via actuators embedded along its body. The
actuating moments required to morph these soft-robots to a desired shape are
often difficult to compute due to the geometric non-linearity associated with
the structure, the errors in modeling the experimental system, and the
limitations in sensing and feedback/actuation capabilities. In this article, we
explore the effect of a simple feedback strategy (actuation being proportional
to the sensed curvature) on the shape of a soft-robot, modeled as an elastica.
The finite number of sensors and actuators, often seen in experiments, is
captured in the model via filters of specified widths. Using proportional
feedback, we study the simple task of straightening the device by compensating
for the sagging introduced by its self-weight. The device undergoes a hierarchy
of morphological instabilities defined in the phase-space given by the
gravito-bending number, non-dimensional sensing/feedback gain, and the scaled
width of the filter. For complex shape-morphing tasks, given a perfect model of
the device with limited sensing and actuating capabilities, we find that a
trade-off arises (set by the sensor spacing & actuator size) between capturing
the long and short wavelength features. We show that the error in
shape-morphing is minimal for a fixed filter width when we choose an
appropriate actuating gain (whose magnitude goes as a square of the filter
width). Our model provides a quantitative lens to study and design slender soft
devices with limited sensing and actuating capabilities for complex maneuvering
applications.

TL;DR: GeCCo是一种通用的低层策略，通过DRL训练，能够跟踪四足机器人的任意接触点，适用于多种任务而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL方法需要针对每个新问题重新定义和调整奖励，耗时且难以扩展。

Method: 提出GeCCo策略，结合任务特定的高层接触规划器和预训练的低层策略。

Result: 在多种运动和操作任务中表现出色，包括复杂地形和物体交互。

Conclusion: GeCCo提供了一种高效、通用的低层控制器，显著提升了任务适应性和训练效率。

Abstract: Most modern approaches to quadruped locomotion focus on using Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to learn policies from scratch, in an end-to-end
manner. Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application
requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present
Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained
with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact
points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a
general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range
of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch.
We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a
wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under
a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing
complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen
stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing
buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more
efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and
the pre-trained generalist policy. A supplementary video can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用被动柔顺软腕实现稳健物体插入的新方法，通过大变形吸收接触力，无需高频控制或力传感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物体插入任务在姿态不确定性和环境变化下容易失败，需要手动微调或控制器重新训练。

Method: 采用柔顺性接触形成和自动故障恢复策略，结合预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）评估执行情况并选择恢复动作。

Conclusion: 柔顺性支持的故障恢复方法显著提高了物体插入任务的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Object insertion tasks are prone to failures under pose uncertainties and
environmental variations, traditionally requiring manual finetuning or
controller retraining. We present a novel approach for robust and resilient
object insertion using a passively compliant soft wrist that enables safe
contact absorption through large deformations, without high-frequency control
or force sensing. Our method structures insertion as compliance-enabled contact
formations, sequential contact states that progressively constrain degrees of
freedom, and integrates automated failure recovery strategies. Our key insight
is that wrist compliance permits safe, repeated recovery attempts; hence, we
refer to it as compliance-enabled failure recovery. We employ a pre-trained
vision-language model (VLM) that assesses each skill execution from terminal
poses and images, identifies failure modes, and proposes recovery actions by
selecting skills and updating goals. In simulation, our method achieved an 83%
success rate, recovering from failures induced by randomized
conditions--including grasp misalignments up to 5 degrees, hole-pose errors up
to 20mm, fivefold increases in friction, and previously unseen
square/rectangular pegs--and we further validate the approach on a real robot.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种强化学习方法，使标准挖掘机铲斗能够自主移除不规则岩石，适应不同土壤条件，成功率达70%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主挖掘技术无法处理大型不规则岩石或需要不切实际的工具更换，影响了施工效率。

Method: 在模拟环境中训练强化学习策略，结合稀疏LiDAR点和本体反馈控制标准挖掘机铲斗。

Result: 现场测试中，12吨挖掘机在不同岩石和土壤条件下成功率为70%，接近人类操作员的83%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，标准施工设备可以在稀疏感知和恶劣户外条件下学习复杂操作。

Abstract: Construction sites frequently require removing large rocks before excavation
or grading can proceed. Human operators typically extract these boulders using
only standard digging buckets, avoiding time-consuming tool changes to
specialized grippers. This task demands manipulating irregular objects with
unknown geometries in harsh outdoor environments where dust, variable lighting,
and occlusions hinder perception. The excavator must adapt to varying soil
resistance--dragging along hard-packed surfaces or penetrating soft
ground--while coordinating multiple hydraulic joints to secure rocks using a
shovel. Current autonomous excavation focuses on continuous media (soil,
gravel) or uses specialized grippers with detailed geometric planning for
discrete objects. These approaches either cannot handle large irregular rocks
or require impractical tool changes that interrupt workflow. We train a
reinforcement learning policy in simulation using rigid-body dynamics and
analytical soil models. The policy processes sparse LiDAR points (just 20 per
rock) from vision-based segmentation and proprioceptive feedback to control
standard excavator buckets. The learned agent discovers different strategies
based on soil resistance: dragging along the surface in hard soil and
penetrating directly in soft conditions. Field tests on a 12-ton excavator
achieved 70% success across varied rocks (0.4-0.7m) and soil types, compared to
83% for human operators. This demonstrates that standard construction equipment
can learn complex manipulation despite sparse perception and challenging
outdoor conditions.

Result: 在三个模拟的随机安全关键控制任务中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: EigenSafe通过主导特征对和备份策略，为随机系统提供了有效的安全控制解决方案。

Abstract: We present EigenSafe, an operator-theoretic framework for learning-enabled
safety-critical control for stochastic systems. In many robotic systems where
dynamics are best modeled as stochastic systems due to factors such as sensing
noise and environmental disturbances, it is challenging for conventional
methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to
provide a holistic measure of safety. We derive a linear operator governing the
dynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its
dominant eigenpair provides information about safety for both individual states
and the overall closed-loop system. The proposed learning framework, called
EigenSafe, jointly learns this dominant eigenpair and a safe backup policy in
an offline manner. The learned eigenfunction is then used to construct a safety
filter that detects potentially unsafe situations and falls back to the backup
policy. The framework is validated in three simulated stochastic
safety-critical control tasks.

Conclusion: 人类数据在动作级学习中具有巨大潜力，协同训练和广泛任务覆盖是关键成功因素。

Abstract: Scaling real robot data is a key bottleneck in imitation learning, leading to
the use of auxiliary data for policy training. While other aspects of robotic
manipulation such as image or language understanding may be learned from
internet-based datasets, acquiring motion knowledge remains challenging. Human
data, with its rich diversity of manipulation behaviors, offers a valuable
resource for this purpose. While previous works show that using human data can
bring benefits, such as improving robustness and training efficiency, it
remains unclear whether it can realize its greatest advantage: enabling robot
policies to directly learn new motions for task completion. In this paper, we
systematically explore this potential through multi-task human-robot
cotraining. We introduce MotionTrans, a framework that includes a data
collection system, a human data transformation pipeline, and a weighted
cotraining strategy. By cotraining 30 human-robot tasks simultaneously, we
direcly transfer motions of 13 tasks from human data to deployable end-to-end
robot policies. Notably, 9 tasks achieve non-trivial success rates in zero-shot
manner. MotionTrans also significantly enhances pretraining-finetuning
performance (+40% success rate). Through ablation study, we also identify key
factors for successful motion learning: cotraining with robot data and broad
task-related motion coverage. These findings unlock the potential of
motion-level learning from human data, offering insights into its effective use
for training robotic manipulation policies. All data, code, and model weights

Abstract: Many research groups face challenges when legacy (unsupported) robotic
platforms lose manufacturer support and cannot accommodate modern sensing,
speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a
revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot that uses upgraded microphones,
RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully
self-contained package. This system combines cloud and local models for
perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and
behaviors. In a pilot validation study, the Enhanced NAO delivered
significantly higher conversational quality and stronger user preference
compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. Key
upgrades, such as beamforming microphones and low-latency audio processing,
reduced artifacts like self-hearing and improved multi-party separation.
Expanded visual and thermal sensing established a foundation for future
interaction capabilities. Beyond the NAO, our framework provides a
platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of
legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.

Result: 在八项长时程任务中平均成功率达79%，显著优于基线方法（<50%）。

Conclusion: RoboSeek展示了在复杂动态环境中的有效性和稳定性，为通用机器人学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Optimizing and refining action execution through
  exploration and interaction is a promising way for robotic
  manipulation. However, practical approaches to interaction driven robotic
learning are still underexplored, particularly for
  long-horizon tasks where sequential decision-making, physical
  constraints, and perceptual uncertainties pose significant chal lenges.
Motivated by embodied cognition theory, we propose
  RoboSeek, a framework for embodied action execution that
  leverages interactive experience to accomplish manipulation
  tasks. RoboSeek optimizes prior knowledge from high-level
  perception models through closed-loop training in simulation
  and achieves robust real-world execution via a real2sim2real
  transfer pipeline. Specifically, we first replicate real-world
  environments in simulation using 3D reconstruction to provide
  visually and physically consistent environments., then we train
  policies in simulation using reinforcement learning and the
  cross-entropy method leveraging visual priors. The learned
  policies are subsequently deployed on real robotic platforms
  for execution. RoboSeek is hardware-agnostic and is evaluated
  on multiple robotic platforms across eight long-horizon ma nipulation tasks
involving sequential interactions, tool use, and
  object handling. Our approach achieves an average success rate
  of 79%, significantly outperforming baselines whose success
  rates remain below 50%, highlighting its generalization and
  robustness across tasks and platforms. Experimental results
  validate the effectiveness of our training framework in complex,
  dynamic real-world settings and demonstrate the stability of the
  proposed real2sim2real transfer mechanism, paving the way for
  more generalizable embodied robotic learning. Project Page:

Abstract: This paper proposes Tac2Motion, a contact-aware reinforcement learning
framework to facilitate the learning of contact-rich in-hand manipulation
tasks, such as removing a lid. To this end, we propose tactile sensing-based
reward shaping and incorporate the sensing into the observation space through

smooth finger gaiting at the same time, leading to higher data efficiency and
robust performance compared to the baseline. We verify the proposed framework
on the opening a lid scenario, showing generalization of the trained policy
into a couple of object types and various dynamics such as torsional friction.

Conclusion: 动态SVO估计和显式自车规划显著提升了预测精度并减少了推理时间。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles (SVs) is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to avoid misguided decisions and potential
accidents. However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and
complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key
impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture
the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories
that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose
SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social
psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing
Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we
obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To
ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are
embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated
trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future
trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets
demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and
interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally
consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation
studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning
components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce
inference time.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection is a central problem in robotics, with applications
ranging from industrial monitoring to search-and-rescue. Traditionally,
inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is
to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this
formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world
environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact
coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and
inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the
target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the
target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a
perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary
objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees
visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy
leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in
simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an
algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a
reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches,
yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and
real-world settings. The project is avialable at

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has substantially progressed by directly
predicting future trajectories from raw perception inputs, which bypasses
traditional modular pipelines. However, mainstream methods trained via
imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to
distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially
unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple
rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose
DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework.
First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity
and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we
introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as
trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM
benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of
90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios
highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving
behaviors.

combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example,
"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists
of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of
the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the
intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its
constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.
Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then
composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of
specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for
demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training
procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for
dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the
base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world
experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions
by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of
specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based
policies and costmap composing baselines. Videos and additional materials can

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多保真度贝叶斯优化的控制器调谐框架，结合数字孪生仿真和真实数据，提高数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对闭环系统中仿真保真度不足或近似模型不准确的问题，提出一种动态校正模型的方法。

Method: 构建多保真度代理模型，结合校正模型动态调整数字孪生估计，并使用成本感知的采集函数平衡改进、保真度和采样成本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在机器人驱动硬件和数值研究中比标准贝叶斯优化和多保真度方法更高效。

Conclusion: 该方法能动态适应新数据，优化数字孪生使用，提高调谐效率。

Abstract: We propose a \textit{guided multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization} framework
for data-efficient controller tuning that integrates corrected digital twin
(DT) simulations with real-world measurements. The method targets closed-loop
systems with limited-fidelity simulations or inexpensive approximations. To
address model mismatch, we build a multi-fidelity surrogate with a learned
correction model that refines DT estimates from real data. An adaptive
cost-aware acquisition function balances expected improvement, fidelity, and
sampling cost. Our method ensures adaptability as new measurements arrive. The
accuracy of DTs is re-estimated, dynamically adapting both cross-source
correlations and the acquisition function. This ensures that accurate DTs are
used more frequently, while inaccurate DTs are appropriately downweighted.
Experiments on robotic drive hardware and supporting numerical studies
demonstrate that our method enhances tuning efficiency compared to standard
Bayesian optimization (BO) and multi-fidelity methods.

TL;DR: M3ET是一种轻量级多模态学习模型，通过Mamba模块和自适应注意力机制优化特征融合与重建，提升推理速度并减少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法在无监督机器人环境中难以充分利用文本模态，且计算资源消耗高。

Method: 结合Mamba模块和语义自适应注意力机制，优化特征融合、对齐和模态重建。

Result: 推理速度提升2.3倍，参数减少67%，VQA任务准确率保持0.74。

Conclusion: M3ET适合资源受限的机器人平台，尽管EQA任务表现有限。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal learning has become essential in robotic vision
and information fusion, especially for understanding human behavior in complex
environments. However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual
modality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic
extraction in unsupervised robotic environments, particularly with significant
modality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading
to high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these
challenges, we propose the Multi Modal Mamba Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a
lightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on
mobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based
adaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and
modality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task
performance, with a 2.3 times increase in pretraining inference speed. In
particular, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 0.74, while the
model's parameter count is reduced by 0.67. Although performance on the EQA
task is limited, M3ET's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment
on resource-constrained robotic platforms.

TL;DR: ReSET算法通过预先调整环境，使模仿学习策略在分布外观察下表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习策略在分布外观察下表现不佳，人类会调整环境以简化任务执行，ReSET旨在赋予机器人相同能力。

Method: ReSET结合人类视频和遥操作数据，决定何时调整场景、预测人类简化动作并映射到机器人动作基元。

Result: ReSET在相同训练数据量下，比扩散策略等基线方法表现更稳健。

Conclusion: ReSET通过环境预调整，显著提升了模仿学习策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective across a wide range of
manipulation tasks. However, IL policies often struggle when faced with
out-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a
previously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,
extensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and
generalizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical
initial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task
execution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier
to grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp
their target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same
capability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their
given policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which
are outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses
so that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we
show that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out
the given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET
algorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic
teleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what
simplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into
robot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other
baselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust
task execution with equal amounts of total training data. See videos at our

Conclusion: HuMam是首个采用Mamba作为融合骨干的端到端人形机器人控制器，在效率、稳定性和控制经济性方面取得了实际进展。

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing
for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer
from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost.
We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a
single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep
targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets
tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term
reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and
body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid
in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training
stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline,
while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is
the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion
backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control
economy.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在协作感知、预测和规划任务中优于其他基线。

Conclusion: 提出的图思维框架为MLLM在协作自动驾驶中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles could face safety-critical
situations when their local sensors are occluded by large nearby objects on the
road. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed
as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework
for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that
incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative
perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of
applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been
considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper,
we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for
MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our
proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware
prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for
training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts. Our
experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in
cooperative perception, prediction, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: RadarSFD是一种基于条件潜在扩散框架的方法，通过单帧雷达数据重建密集LiDAR点云，适用于小型机器人系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达在恶劣环境下表现稳健，但现有方法依赖多帧合成或合成孔径雷达（SAR），不适用于小型系统。

Method: 利用预训练的单目深度估计器传递几何先验，通过潜在扩散框架和双空间损失优化输出。

Result: 在RadarHD基准测试中，RadarSFD显著优于单帧基线，并与多帧方法竞争。

Conclusion: RadarSFD首次实现了无需SAR的单帧毫米波雷达密集点云感知，适用于紧凑机器人系统。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar provides perception robust to fog, smoke, dust, and low
light, making it attractive for size, weight, and power constrained robotic
platforms. Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture
or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for
small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a
conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point
clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers
geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion
backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation,
and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and
pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer
Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame
RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame
methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and
narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong
generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained
initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together,
these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar
pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces ByteWrist, a novel highly-flexible and anthropomorphic
parallel wrist for robotic manipulation. ByteWrist addresses the critical
limitations of existing serial and parallel wrists in narrow-space operations
through a compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism integrated with
arc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw)
motion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly
suitable for complex unstructured environments such as home services, medical
assistance, and precision assembly. The key innovations include: (1) a nested
three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume while enabling
independent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force
transmission and expand motion range, and (3) a central supporting ball
functioning as a spherical joint that enhances structural stiffness without
compromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present comprehensive kinematic
modeling including forward / inverse kinematics and a numerical Jacobian
solution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates
strong performance in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative
manipulation tasks, outperforming Kinova-based systems. Results indicate
significant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and stiffness compared to
traditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as a promising solution for
next-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments.

Result: CNN表现略优于DNN，数据多样性对模型性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 深度学习可有效自动化识别代码中的并行化结构，为软件优化提供工具。

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in
programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic
algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of
code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous
loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the
loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and
preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were
implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a
robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of
both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance,
but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset
sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These
results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the
identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool
for software optimization and performance improvement.

Motivation: 增材制造中尺寸精度的重要性，需要量化不确定性以支持稳健决策和风险分析。

Method: 使用支持向量回归（SVR）、高斯过程回归（GPR）和贝叶斯神经网络（BNN）预测目标差异（DFT），结合设计和制造变量。

Result: SVR接近工艺重复性精度，GPR提供强预测性能和可解释性，BNN捕获不确定性的不同类型。

Conclusion: 结合确定性和概率性方法，为增材制造提供不确定性感知预测模型，支持数据驱动的制造策略。

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to accurately estimate dimensions of
additively manufactured components. Using a dataset of 405 parts from nine
production runs involving two machines, three polymer materials, and two-part
configurations, we examine five key design features. To capture both design
information and manufacturing variability, we employ models integrating
continuous and categorical factors. For predicting Difference from Target (DFT)
values, we test deterministic and probabilistic machine learning methods.
Deterministic models, trained on 80% of the dataset, provide precise point
estimates, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving accuracy close to
process repeatability. To address systematic deviations, we adopt Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). GPR delivers
strong predictive performance and interpretability, while BNNs capture both
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We investigate two BNN approaches: one
balancing accuracy and uncertainty capture, and another offering richer
uncertainty decomposition but with lower dimensional accuracy. Our results
underscore the importance of quantifying epistemic uncertainty for robust
decision-making, risk assessment, and model improvement. We discuss trade-offs
between GPR and BNNs in terms of predictive power, interpretability, and
computational efficiency, noting that model choice depends on analytical needs.
By combining deterministic precision with probabilistic uncertainty
quantification, our study provides a rigorous foundation for uncertainty-aware
predictive modeling in AM. This approach not only enhances dimensional accuracy
but also supports reliable, risk-informed design strategies, thereby advancing
data-driven manufacturing methodologies.

Result: 在DUD-E和ZINC数据集上，SubDyve在BEDROC和EF1%指标上分别提升高达34.0和24.6。

Conclusion: SubDyve在低标签虚拟筛选中表现出色，通过子图感知和迭代优化显著提升性能。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) aims to identify bioactive compounds from vast
chemical libraries, but remains difficult in low-label regimes where only a few
actives are known. Existing methods largely rely on general-purpose molecular
fingerprints and overlook class-discriminative substructures critical to
bioactivity. Moreover, they consider molecules independently, limiting
effectiveness in low-label regimes. We introduce SubDyve, a network-based VS
framework that constructs a subgraph-aware similarity network and propagates
activity signals from a small known actives. When few active compounds are
available, SubDyve performs iterative seed refinement, incrementally promoting
new candidates based on local false discovery rate. This strategy expands the
seed set with promising candidates while controlling false positives from
topological bias and overexpansion. We evaluate SubDyve on ten DUD-E targets
under zero-shot conditions and on the CDK7 target with a 10-million-compound
ZINC dataset. SubDyve consistently outperforms existing fingerprint or
embedding-based approaches, achieving margins of up to +34.0 on the BEDROC and
+24.6 on the EF1% metric.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更安全、更鲁棒的理论基础，同时提升了可解释性。

Abstract: Deep perception networks in autonomous driving traditionally rely on
data-intensive training regimes and post-hoc anomaly detection, often
disregarding fundamental information-theoretic constraints governing stable
information processing. We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical
communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into
task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two
theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth
variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic
decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under
realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated
layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally
encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by
these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as
a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy
improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies
information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling
explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy
deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection
benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss
consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically
enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up
to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not
only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical
foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.

Result: FVP在早期训练中能快速减少损失并保持准确性，但在长期训练或大数据集下性能下降。

Conclusion: 建议将池化作为深度学习早期训练策略，以利用其初始效率，避免后期性能下降。

Abstract: The process of pooling vertices involves the creation of a new vertex, which
becomes adjacent to all the vertices that were originally adjacent to the
endpoints of the vertices being pooled. After this, the endpoints of these
vertices and all edges connected to them are removed. In this document, we
introduce a formal framework for the concept of fuzzy vertex pooling (FVP) and
provide an overview of its key properties with its applications to neural
networks. The pooling model demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing
loss rapidly while maintaining competitive accuracy, even with fewer hidden
layer neurons. However, this advantage diminishes over extended training
periods or with larger datasets, where the model's performance tends to
degrade. This study highlights the limitations of pooling in later stages of
deep learning training, rendering it less effective for prolonged or
large-scale applications. Consequently, pooling is recommended as a strategy
for early-stage training in advanced deep learning models to leverage its
initial efficiency.

Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of
thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning
of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the
prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses
significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training
infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault
diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient
continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU
infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of
LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top
priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging
parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables
high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with
an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and
efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU
platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month
training job on 9,600 GPUs.

Result: 在广泛基准测试中显著优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 分布转换视角有效缓解数据瓶颈，为离线优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies the black-box optimization task which aims to find the
maxima of a black-box function using a static set of its observed input-output
pairs. This is often achieved via learning and optimizing a surrogate function
with that offline data. Alternatively, it can also be framed as an inverse
modeling task that maps a desired performance to potential input candidates
that achieve it. Both approaches are constrained by the limited amount of
offline data. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a new perspective that
casts offline optimization as a distributional translation task. This is
formulated as learning a probabilistic bridge transforming an implicit
distribution of low-value inputs (i.e., offline data) into another distribution
of high-value inputs (i.e., solution candidates). Such probabilistic bridge can
be learned using low- and high-value inputs sampled from synthetic functions
that resemble the target function. These synthetic functions are constructed as
the mean posterior of multiple Gaussian processes fitted with different
parameterizations on the offline data, alleviating the data bottleneck. The
proposed approach is evaluated on an extensive benchmark comprising most recent
methods, demonstrating significant improvement and establishing a new
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Auto-bidding systems are widely used in advertising to automatically
determine bid values under constraints such as total budget and Return-on-Spend
(RoS) targets. Existing works often assume that the value of an ad impression,
such as the conversion rate, is known. This paper considers the more realistic
scenario where the true value is unknown. We propose a novel method that uses
conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of these values based on
machine learning methods trained on historical bidding data with contextual
features, without assuming the data are i.i.d. This approach is compatible with
current industry systems that use machine learning to predict values. Building
on prediction intervals, we introduce an adjusted value estimator derived from
machine learning predictions, and show that it provides performance guarantees
without requiring knowledge of the true value. We apply this method to enhance
existing auto-bidding algorithms with budget and RoS constraints, and establish
theoretical guarantees for achieving high reward while keeping RoS violations
low. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world industrial datasets
demonstrate that our approach improves performance while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出CISIR方法解决高不平衡回归问题，结合相关性、单调递减重要性函数和分层采样，在五个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高不平衡回归问题在实际应用中很重要（如预测罕见有害太阳高能粒子事件），但现有方法如MSE损失和均匀采样存在不足。

Method: 提出CISIR方法，结合相关性分析、单调递减重要性函数（MDI）和分层采样。

Result: 实验表明CISIR在五个数据集上误差更低、相关性更高，且其相关性组件可提升其他方法性能。

Conclusion: CISIR有效解决了高不平衡回归问题，MDI重要性函数优于其他函数。

Abstract: We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance
ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target
values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the
intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For
regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted
and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex
functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare
instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically
Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five
datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error
and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation
component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI
importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found in

TL;DR: UNIPHY+Lab框架结合PPG基础模型和Mamba模型，用于连续、个性化的实验室值预测，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床实验室测试的间歇性和侵入性限制，利用PPG信号实现非侵入性、连续的生化监测。

Method: 结合PPG基础模型进行局部波形编码，使用Mamba模型进行长时序建模，并采用FiLM调制初始状态以考虑患者特异性。

Result: 在两个ICU数据集上预测五项关键实验室测试，MAE、RMSE和R²指标显著优于LSTM和基线方法。

Conclusion: 证明了通过常规PPG监测实现连续、个性化实验室值估计的可行性，为重症监护中的非侵入性生化监测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory tests provide essential biochemical measurements for
diagnosis and treatment, but are limited by intermittent and invasive sampling.
In contrast, photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a non-invasive, continuously recorded
signal in intensive care units (ICUs) that reflects cardiovascular dynamics and
can serve as a proxy for latent physiological changes. We propose UNIPHY+Lab, a
framework that combines a large-scale PPG foundation model for local waveform
encoding with a patient-aware Mamba model for long-range temporal modeling. Our
architecture addresses three challenges: (1) capturing extended temporal trends
in laboratory values, (2) accounting for patient-specific baseline variation
via FiLM-modulated initial states, and (3) performing multi-task estimation for
interrelated biomarkers. We evaluate our method on the two ICU datasets for
predicting the five key laboratory tests. The results show substantial
improvements over the LSTM and carry-forward baselines in MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$
among most of the estimation targets. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
continuous, personalized lab value estimation from routine PPG monitoring,
offering a pathway toward non-invasive biochemical surveillance in critical
care.

Result: 在计算机和体外实验中验证了方法有效性，生成了高亲和力结合物。

Conclusion: 该方法为抗体优化提供了高效的结构和序列结合策略。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibody candidates often require extensive engineering to
improve key functional and developability properties before clinical
development. This can be achieved through iterative design, where starting
molecules are optimized over several rounds of in vitro experiments. While
protein structure can provide a strong inductive bias, it is rarely used in
iterative design due to the lack of structural data for continually evolving
lead molecules over the course of optimization. In this work, we propose a
strategy for iterative antibody optimization that leverages both sequence and
structure as well as accumulating lab measurements of binding and
developability. Building on prior work, we first train a sequence-structure
diffusion generative model that operates on antibody-antigen complexes. We then
outline an approach to use this model, together with carefully predicted
antibody-antigen complexes, to optimize lead candidates throughout the
iterative design process. Further, we describe a guided sampling approach that
biases generation toward desirable properties by integrating models trained on
experimental data from iterative design. We evaluate our approach in multiple
in silico and in vitro experiments, demonstrating that it produces
high-affinity binders at multiple stages of an active antibody optimization
campaign.

Result: 通过理论保证和实验验证，EMPEROR能捕获更丰富的分布信息，且计算高效。

Conclusion: EMPEROR为高维概率分布提供了一种数学严谨且计算高效的表示方法。

Abstract: We introduce EMPEROR (Efficient Moment-Preserving Representation of
Distributions), a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient
framework for representing high-dimensional probability measures arising in
neural network representations. Unlike heuristic global pooling operations,
EMPEROR encodes a feature distribution through its statistical moments. Our
approach leverages the theory of sliced moments: features are projected onto
multiple directions, lightweight univariate Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are
fit to each projection, and the resulting slice parameters are aggregated into
a compact descriptor. We establish determinacy guarantees via Carleman's
condition and the Cram\'er-Wold theorem, ensuring that the GMM is uniquely
determined by its sliced moments, and we derive finite-sample error bounds that
scale optimally with the number of slices and samples. Empirically, EMPEROR
captures richer distributional information than common pooling schemes across
various data modalities, while remaining computationally efficient and broadly
applicable.

Conclusion: CoUn通过语义相似性和表示调整，实现了更有效的机器遗忘。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget"
data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining
"retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight
perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this,
we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a
model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data
based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this
behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning
(CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically,
CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly
adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain
representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning.
Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that
CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning
effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines
empowers their unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: 隐私保护的协作学习在金融领域具有实际价值，即使数据异构和个性化需求存在。

Abstract: This paper studies Federated Learning (FL) for binary classification of
volatile financial market trends. Using a shared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
classifier, we compare three scenarios: (i) a centralized model trained on the
union of all data, (ii) a single-agent model trained on an individual data
subset, and (iii) a privacy-preserving FL collaboration in which agents
exchange only model updates, never raw data. We then extend the study with
additional market features, deliberately introducing not independent and
identically distributed data (non-IID) across agents, personalized FL and
employing differential privacy. Our numerical experiments show that FL achieves
accuracy and generalization on par with the centralized baseline, while
significantly outperforming the single-agent model. The results show that
collaborative, privacy-preserving learning provides collective tangible value
in finance, even under realistic data heterogeneity and personalization
requirements.

TL;DR: GRID是一种基于图的三阶段因果发现方法，用于提高商业建筑中HVAC故障诊断的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC故障诊断耗时长且准确率低（60%），主要依赖相关性而非因果性分析。

Method: GRID结合约束搜索、神经结构方程建模和语言模型先验，从传感器数据中恢复有向无环图。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，GRID的F1分数为0.65至1.00，优于十种基线方法，并在干预调度中降低操作影响和风险。

Conclusion: GRID通过整合多种方法填补了建筑分析中的观测-因果差距，显著提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Manual HVAC fault diagnosis in commercial buildings takes 8-12 hours per
incident and achieves only 60 percent diagnostic accuracy, reflecting analytics
that stop at correlation instead of causation. To close this gap, we present
GRID (Graph-based Reasoning for Intervention and Discovery), a three-stage
causal discovery pipeline that combines constraint-based search, neural
structural equation modeling, and language model priors to recover directed
acyclic graphs from building sensor data. Across six benchmarks: synthetic
rooms, EnergyPlus simulation, the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset,
and a live office testbed, GRID achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.65 to 1.00,
with exact recovery (F1 = 1.00) in three controlled environments (Base, Hidden,
Physical) and strong performance on real-world data (F1 = 0.89 on ASHRAE, 0.86
in noisy conditions). The method outperforms ten baseline approaches across all
evaluation scenarios. Intervention scheduling achieves low operational impact
in most scenarios (cost <= 0.026) while reducing risk metrics compared to
baseline approaches. The framework integrates constraint-based methods, neural
architectures, and domain-specific language model prompts to address the
observational-causal gap in building analytics.

Result: 成功泛化的模型表现出局部条件分数，干预可恢复失败模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 局部性是组合泛化的关键机制，理论支持其在特征空间中的应用。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models appear capable of compositional generalization,
i.e., generating convincing samples for out-of-distribution combinations of
conditioners, but the mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear. To
make this concrete, we study length generalization, the ability to generate
images with more objects than seen during training. In a controlled CLEVR
setting (Johnson et al., 2017), we find that length generalization is
achievable in some cases but not others, suggesting that models only sometimes
learn the underlying compositional structure. We then investigate locality as a
structural mechanism for compositional generalization. Prior works proposed
score locality as a mechanism for creativity in unconditional diffusion models
(Kamb & Ganguli, 2024; Niedoba et al., 2024), but did not address flexible
conditioning or compositional generalization. In this paper, we prove an exact
equivalence between a specific compositional structure ("conditional projective
composition") (Bradley et al., 2025) and scores with sparse dependencies on
both pixels and conditioners ("local conditional scores"). This theory also
extends to feature-space compositionality. We validate our theory empirically:
CLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional
scores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal
intervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length
generalization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate
feature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary
evidence of compositional structure in SDXL.

Abstract: Entropic causal inference is a recent framework for learning the causal graph
between two variables from observational data by finding the
information-theoretically simplest structural explanation of the data, i.e.,
the model with smallest entropy. In our work, we first extend the causal graph
identifiability result in the two-variable setting under relaxed assumptions.
We then show the first identifiability result using the entropic approach for
learning causal graphs with more than two nodes. Our approach utilizes the
property that ancestrality between a source node and its descendants can be
determined using the bivariate entropic tests. We provide a sound sequential
peeling algorithm for general graphs that relies on this property. We also
propose a heuristic algorithm for small graphs that shows strong empirical
performance. We rigorously evaluate the performance of our algorithms on
synthetic data generated from a variety of models, observing improvement over
prior work. Finally we test our algorithms on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM生成表格数据提供了一种可扩展且实用的去偏解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising results in tabular data
generation. However, inherent historical biases in tabular datasets often cause
LLMs to exacerbate fairness issues, particularly when multiple advantaged and
protected features are involved. In this work, we introduce a universal
debiasing framework that minimizes group-level dependencies by simultaneously
reducing the mutual information between advantaged and protected attributes. By
leveraging the autoregressive structure and analytic sampling distributions of
LLM-based tabular data generators, our approach efficiently computes mutual
information, reducing the need for cumbersome numerical estimations. Building
on this foundation, we propose two complementary methods: a direct preference
optimization (DPO)-based strategy, namely UDF-DPO, that integrates seamlessly
with existing models, and a targeted debiasing technique, namely UDF-MIX, that
achieves debiasing without tuning the parameters of LLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively balances fairness and utility,
offering a scalable and practical solution for debiasing in high-stakes
applications.

Abstract: We revisit the longstanding question of how physical structures in urban
landscapes influence crime. Leveraging machine learning-based matching
techniques to control for demographic composition, we estimate the effects of
several types of urban structures on the incidence of violent crime in New York
City and Chicago. We additionally contribute to a growing body of literature
documenting the relationship between perception of crime and actual crime rates
by separately analyzing how the physical urban landscape shapes subjective
feelings of safety. Our results are twofold. First, in consensus with prior
work, we demonstrate a "broken windows" effect in which abandoned buildings, a
sign of social disorder, are associated with both greater incidence of crime
and a heightened perception of danger. This is also true of types of urban
structures that draw foot traffic such as public transportation infrastructure.
Second, these effects are not uniform within or across cities. The criminogenic
effects of the same structure types across two cities differ in magnitude,
degree of spatial localization, and heterogeneity across subgroups, while
within the same city, the effects of different structure types are confounded
by different demographic variables. Taken together, these results emphasize
that one-size-fits-all approaches to crime reduction are untenable and policy
interventions must be specifically tailored to their targets.

Motivation: 探讨预训练模型微调对性别公平性的影响，尤其是在领域转移时。

Method: 使用PPG-GPT模型在三个数据集上微调，并评估HR预测准确性和性别公平性。提出了FairTune框架，测试了三种缓解策略。

Result: 微调显著降低了预测误差，但可能加剧公平性差距。FairTune中的IF和GroupDRO策略有效减少了公平性差距且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 公平性不会自然通过微调实现，需要显式缓解策略以确保生理基础模型的公平部署。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on physiological data such as
photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are increasingly used to improve heart rate
(HR) prediction across diverse settings. Fine-tuning these models for local
deployment is often seen as a practical and scalable strategy. However, its
impact on demographic fairness particularly under domain shifts remains
underexplored. We fine-tune PPG-GPT a transformer-based foundation model
pretrained on intensive care unit (ICU) data across three heterogeneous
datasets (ICU, wearable, smartphone) and systematically evaluate the effects on
HR prediction accuracy and gender fairness. While fine-tuning substantially
reduces mean absolute error (up to 80%), it can simultaneously widen fairness
gaps, especially in larger models and under significant distributional
characteristics shifts. To address this, we introduce FairTune, a bias-aware
fine-tuning framework in which we benchmark three mitigation strategies: class
weighting based on inverse group frequency (IF), Group Distributionally Robust
Optimization (GroupDRO), and adversarial debiasing (ADV). We find that IF and
GroupDRO significantly reduce fairness gaps without compromising accuracy, with
effectiveness varying by deployment domain. Representation analyses further
reveal that mitigation techniques reshape internal embeddings to reduce
demographic clustering. Our findings highlight that fairness does not emerge as
a natural byproduct of fine-tuning and that explicit mitigation is essential
for equitable deployment of physiological foundation models.

Abstract: The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of
AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in
which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance
degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance
shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical
manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from
generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where
models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content
during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly
driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each
training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation.
Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy
to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate
model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances
visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing
collapse.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly mitigated the
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding the generation with
external knowledge. Recent extensions of RAG to graph-based retrieval offer a
promising direction, leveraging the structural knowledge for multi-hop
reasoning. However, existing graph RAG typically decouples retrieval and
reasoning processes, which prevents the retriever from adapting to the
reasoning needs of the LLM. They also struggle with scalability when performing
multi-hop expansion over large-scale graphs, or depend heavily on annotated
ground-truth entities, which are often unavailable in open-domain settings. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel graph retriever trained end-to-end
with LLM, which features an attention-based growing and pruning mechanism,
adaptively navigating multi-hop relevant entities while filtering out noise.
Within the extracted subgraph, structural knowledge and semantic features are
encoded via soft tokens and the verbalized graph, respectively, which are
infused into the LLM together, thereby enhancing its reasoning capability and
facilitating interactive joint training of the graph retriever and the LLM
reasoner. Experimental results across three QA benchmarks show that our
approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the
strength of joint graph-LLM optimization for complex reasoning tasks. Notably,
our framework eliminates the need for predefined ground-truth entities by
directly optimizing the retriever using LLM logits as implicit feedback, making
it especially effective in open-domain settings.

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高效、隐私保护的RAG解决方案。

Abstract: When existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions are intended to
be used for new knowledge domains, it is necessary to update their encoders,
which are taken to be pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, fully
finetuning these large models is compute- and memory-intensive, and even
infeasible when deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. We propose a
novel encoder architecture in this work that addresses this limitation by using
a frozen small language model (SLM), which satisfies the memory constraints of
edge devices, and inserting a small adapter network before the transformer
blocks of the SLM. The trainable adapter takes the token embeddings of the new
corpus and learns to produce enhanced soft embeddings for it, while requiring
significantly less compute power to update than full fine-tuning. We further
propose a novel retrieval mechanism by attaching a classifier head to the SLM
encoder, which is trained to learn a similarity mapping of the input embeddings
to their corresponding documents. Finally, to enable the online fine-tuning of
both (i) the encoder soft embeddings and (ii) the classifier-as-retriever on
edge devices, we adopt federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) to
achieve an efficient, privacy-preserving, and product-grade training solution.
We conduct a theoretical analysis of our methodology, establishing convergence
guarantees under mild assumptions on gradient variance when deployed for
general smooth nonconvex loss functions. Through extensive numerical
experiments, we demonstrate (i) the efficacy of obtaining soft embeddings to
enhance the encoder, (ii) training a classifier to improve the retriever, and
(iii) the role of FL in achieving speedup.

Result: 在5个基准数据集中的4个上达到最优性能，并在14种方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: LLM作为知识放大器，为半监督学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted co-training approach that is
guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, in our co-training approach, we
use LLM labels on unlabeled data as target labels and co-train two encoder-only
based networks that train each other over multiple iterations: first, all
samples are forwarded through each network and historical estimates of each
network's confidence in the LLM label are recorded; second, a dynamic
importance weight is derived for each sample according to each network's belief
in the quality of the LLM label for that sample; finally, the two networks
exchange importance weights with each other -- each network back-propagates all
samples weighted with the importance weights coming from its peer network and
updates its own parameters. By strategically utilizing LLM-generated guidance,
our approach significantly outperforms conventional SSL methods, particularly
in settings with abundant unlabeled data. Empirical results show that it
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets and
ranks first among 14 compared methods according to the Friedman test. Our
results highlight a new direction in semi-supervised learning -- where LLMs
serve as knowledge amplifiers, enabling backbone co-training models to achieve
state-of-the-art performance efficiently.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SCAN的自去噪蒙特卡洛标注框架，用于高效合成数据和噪声容忍学习，显著提升了过程奖励模型（PRMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发PRMs面临高成本和可扩展性差的问题，而现有的蒙特卡洛估计合成数据噪声率高，容易导致过拟合。

Method: 通过分析MC估计合成数据中的噪声分布，提出SCAN框架，结合自去噪策略和鲁棒学习策略。

Result: SCAN使PRMs在仅6%推理成本下表现优异，并在ProcessBench上F1分数提升39.2。

Conclusion: SCAN展示了在可扩展、成本高效和鲁棒的PRM训练中的潜力。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that
facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving
effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing
PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of
human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a
promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause
overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a
preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC
estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and
overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo
Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning
framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g.,
1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising
strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the
inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning
strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a
39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using
only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines,
including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as
PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the
synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable,
cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

Motivation: 解决ViT自编码器中Class token利用不足和静态注意力机制导致的生成控制和效率问题。

Method: 将Class token映射为全局潜在变量，指导局部潜在变量生成；基于共识理论设计动态注意力机制和头部冻结策略。

Result: 显著提升计算效率且不牺牲生成质量，实现更高效的Transformer生成。

Conclusion: ViTCAE通过结合生成核心和自适应注意力机制，为Transformer生成提供了更高效可控的方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global
Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative
control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework
that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative
linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global
latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level
latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics
directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from
opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of
interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a
convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's
influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables
a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded
diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster
functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to
significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By
unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted
in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and
controllable approach to transformer-based generation.

Motivation: 现有的数字OTA方法难以同时实现强收敛性和对噪声的鲁棒性，限制了在低信噪比条件下的性能。

Method: 结合展开解码器和联合学习的无源随机访问码本，扩展了可靠操作范围。

Result: 在低信噪比条件下可靠操作范围扩展了7 dB以上，并在所有信噪比水平上改善了全局模型收敛性。

Conclusion: 基于学习的设计在FEEL中具有潜力，能够显著提升性能。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables distributed model training across
wireless devices without centralising raw data, but deployment is constrained
by the wireless uplink. A promising direction is over-the-air (OTA)
aggregation, which merges communication with computation. Existing digital OTA
methods can achieve either strong convergence or robustness to noise, but
struggle to achieve both simultaneously, limiting performance in low
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) where many IoT devices operate. This work
proposes a learnt digital OTA framework that extends reliable operation into
low-SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as
state-of-the-art. The proposed method combines an unrolled decoder with a
jointly learnt unsourced random access codebook. Results show an extension of
reliable operation by more than 7 dB, with improved global model convergence
across all SNR levels, highlighting the potential of learning-based design for
FEEL.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究对平均奖励MDP（AMDP）的样本复杂度已有深入理解，但对约束平均奖励MDP（CAMDP）的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于模型的算法，支持两种设置：松弛可行性和严格可行性，分别允许小约束违反和完全满足约束。

Result: 算法在松弛和严格可行性设置下的样本复杂度分别为$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$和$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$，并证明了严格可行性情况下的匹配下界。

Conclusion: 本文首次为CAMDP提供了极小极大最优界限，填补了理论空白。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the sample
complexity of learning in average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs)
under the generative model. However, much less is known about the constrained
average-reward MDP (CAMDP), where policies must satisfy long-run average
constraints. In this work, we address this gap by studying the sample
complexity of learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in CAMDPs under a
generative model. We propose a model-based algorithm that operates under two
settings: (i) relaxed feasibility, which allows small constraint violations,
and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy satisfies the constraint.
We show that our algorithm achieves sample complexities of
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$ and $\tilde{O}
\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$ under the relaxed and
strict feasibility settings, respectively. Here, $\zeta$ is the Slater constant
indicating the size of the feasible region, $H$ is the span bound of the bias
function, and $B$ is the transient time bound. Moreover, a matching lower bound
of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ for the
strict feasibility case is established, thus providing the first
minimax-optimal bounds for CAMDPs. Our results close the theoretical gap in
understanding the complexity of constrained average-reward MDPs.

Result: 在NetFlow基准测试中达到99.98% PR-AUC和99.61%宏F1分数，优于基线5-25个百分点。

Conclusion: GraphIDS通过端到端框架优化嵌入，有效识别恶意流量。

Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly
under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent
works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection,
they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting
the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a
self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by
learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a
masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its
local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a
Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly
learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring
explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high
reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end
framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream
task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow
benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score,
outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.

TL;DR: CAPE是一种新颖的位置编码方法，通过识别非顺序特征的因果结构并嵌入双曲空间，为Transformer提供因果感知的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法需要预定义的顺序，不适用于具有非顺序但因果相关特征的真实数据。

Method: CAPE利用广义结构方程建模构建加权有向无环图（DAG），并将其嵌入双曲空间以保留几何结构，生成因果感知的位置编码。

Result: 理论分析表明CAPE生成的位置编码具有因果距离衰减、因果普遍性衰减和对位置扰动的鲁棒性。实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CAPE为Transformer处理非顺序特征数据提供了一种有效的因果感知位置编码方法。

Abstract: Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with
positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand
predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data
with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation,
we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure
over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using
generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in
hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a
hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal
graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields
causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into
their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism.
Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings
possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal
distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and
robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and
real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and
effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

Abstract: Retrieval systems rely on representations learned by increasingly powerful
models. However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned
representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication
between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained
neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to
adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt
well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original
representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original
structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key
challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those
of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly
learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality
constraint, namely $\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, while learning an
affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while
retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across
various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it
preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across
model updates. Code available at:

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising feedback
control strategy for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs). When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in
state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been
proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In
particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents
cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on
local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may
become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents
is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in
PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a
decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional,
parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to
effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect
to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by
sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control
problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can
effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents,
outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal
with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and
(iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of
~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on
computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating
the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了电力中断预测的性能。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting power outages is a complex task influenced by diverse
factors such as weather conditions [1], vegetation, wildlife, and load
fluctuations. These factors introduce substantial variability and noise into
outage data, making reliable prediction challenging. Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly
effective for modeling nonlinear and dynamic time-series data, with proven
applications in stock price forecasting [2], energy demand prediction, demand
response [3], and traffic flow management [4]. This paper introduces a hybrid
deep learning framework, termed PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, that integrates
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a
Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is
employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson
Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM
component enhances temporal feature learning through efficient gradient
optimization and long-term dependency capture. The framework is evaluated using
real-world outage records from Michigan, and results indicate that the proposed
approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: Why should a clinician trust an Artificial Intelligence (AI) prediction?
Despite the increasing accuracy of machine learning methods in medicine, the
lack of transparency continues to hinder their adoption in clinical practice.
In this work, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for clinical
classification tasks on tabular data. Unlike traditional neural networks, KANs
are function-based architectures that offer intrinsic interpretability through
transparent, symbolic representations. We introduce Logistic-KAN, a flexible
generalization of logistic regression, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Additive Model
(KAAM), a simplified additive variant that delivers transparent, symbolic
formulas. Unlike black-box models that require post-hoc explainability tools,
our models support built-in patient-level insights, intuitive visualizations,
and nearest-patient retrieval. Across multiple health datasets, our models
match or outperform standard baselines, while remaining fully interpretable.
These results position KANs as a promising step toward trustworthy AI that
clinicians can understand, audit, and act upon.

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提升了理论分析的灵活性，还为其他随机过程的分析提供了潜在工具。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in
applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor
influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers.
Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to
their empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of
$\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify
regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic
dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical
approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such
assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence
guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving
upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly
applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used
samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our
approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a
more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure
methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of
other stochastic processes.

TL;DR: GMC是一种几何混合分类器，结合了线性模型的效率和核/深度模型的表达能力，适用于多模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性模型在多模态数据上表现不佳，而高容量方法（如核SVM、深度网络）又缺乏可解释性和计算成本高的问题。

Method: GMC将每个类表示为超平面的混合，使用温度控制的soft-OR（log-sum-exp）近似最大值，并结合随机傅里叶特征（RFF）进行非线性映射。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，GMC表现优于线性基线和k-NN，与RBF-SVM、随机森林和小型MLP竞争，且具有几何可解释性。

Conclusion: GMC在准确性、可解释性和效率之间取得了平衡，比线性模型更具表达力，比核或深度模型更轻量、透明和快速。

Abstract: Many real world categories are multimodal, with single classes occupying
disjoint regions in feature space. Classical linear models (logistic
regression, linear SVM) use a single global hyperplane and perform poorly on
such data, while high-capacity methods (kernel SVMs, deep nets) fit multimodal
structure but at the expense of interpretability, heavier tuning, and higher
computational cost. We propose the Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC), a
discriminative model that represents each class as a mixture of hyperplanes.
Within each class, GMC combines plane scores via a temperature-controlled
soft-OR (log-sum-exp), smoothly approximating the max; across classes, standard
softmax yields probabilistic posteriors. GMC optionally uses Random Fourier
Features (RFF) for nonlinear mappings while keeping inference linear in the
number of planes and features. Our practical training recipe: geometry-aware
k-means initialization, silhouette-based plane budgeting, alpha annealing,
usage-aware L2 regularization, label smoothing, and early stopping, makes GMC
plug-and-play. Across synthetic multimodal datasets (moons, circles, blobs,
spirals) and tabular/image benchmarks (iris, wine, WDBC, digits), GMC
consistently outperforms linear baselines and k-NN, is competitive with
RBF-SVM, Random Forests, and small MLPs, and provides geometric introspection
via per-plane and class responsibility visualizations. Inference scales
linearly in planes and features, making GMC CPU-friendly, with single-digit
microsecond latency per example, often faster than RBF-SVM and compact MLPs.
Post-hoc temperature scaling reduces ECE from about 0.06 to 0.02. GMC thus
strikes a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency: it
is more expressive than linear models and lighter, more transparent, and faster
than kernel or deep models.

TL;DR: DISCO Steering通过直接调制注意力头中的查询和值表示空间，实现了更精细的控制，性能优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过在推理时添加引导向量来指导大语言模型输出，但查询和值表示空间具有更高的线性可区分性。

Method: 提出DISCO Steering，直接注入引导向量到注意力头的查询和值表示空间。

Result: 在多个数据集上，DISCO Steering性能优于其他基线方法，效果评分最高提升19.1%。

Conclusion: 查询和值空间是引导向量方法的有力构建模块。

Abstract: A variety of recent methods guide large language model outputs via the
inference-time addition of steering vectors to residual-stream or
attention-head representations. In contrast, we propose to inject steering
vectors directly into the query and value representation spaces within
attention heads. We provide evidence that a greater portion of these spaces
exhibit high linear discriminability of concepts --a key property motivating
the use of steering vectors-- than attention head outputs. We analytically
characterize the effect of our method, which we term DISentangled COmmunication
(DISCO) Steering, on attention head outputs. Our analysis reveals that DISCO
disentangles a strong but underutilized baseline, steering attention inputs,
which implicitly modifies queries and values in a rigid manner. In contrast,
DISCO's direct modulation of these components enables more granular control. We
find that DISCO achieves superior performance over a number of steering vector
baselines across multiple datasets on LLaMA 3.1 8B and Gemma 2 9B, with
steering efficacy scoring up to 19.1% higher than the runner-up. Our results
support the conclusion that the query and value spaces are powerful building
blocks for steering vector methods.

TL;DR: KANO是一种双域神经算子，结合了谱和空间基，具有符号可解释性，优于FNO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FNO在纯谱域中的局限性，使其能处理更广泛的物理输入。

Method: 通过双域参数化（谱和空间基）设计KANO，理论证明其优于FNO。

Result: KANO在位置依赖微分算子和量子哈密顿学习中表现优异，精度远超FNO。

Conclusion: KANO在表达能力和实际性能上均显著优于FNO，适用于更广泛的物理问题。

Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural
operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with
intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO
overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO
remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics for any physical
input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and
strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims
empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO
robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning
benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic
representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and
attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement
data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave
function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: SOLAR通过为每个子网络分配独立的分类头，减少参数共享带来的表示干扰，提升OFA训练中的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFA训练中过多的参数共享限制了表示能力，导致校准和性能下降。

Method: 提出SOLAR技术，为每个子网络分配独立的分类头，解耦逻辑学习过程。

Result: 在多个数据集和骨干网络上，SOLAR显著提升了子网络的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SOLAR是一种简单有效的方法，能显著改善OFA训练的性能。

Abstract: Once-for-All (OFA) training enables a single super-net to generate multiple
sub-nets tailored to diverse deployment scenarios, supporting flexible
trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and model-size without retraining.
However, as the number of supported sub-nets increases, excessive parameter
sharing in the backbone limits representational capacity, leading to degraded
calibration and reduced overall performance. To address this, we propose SOLAR
(Switchable Output Layer for Accuracy and Robustness in Once-for-All Training),
a simple yet effective technique that assigns each sub-net a separate
classification head. By decoupling the logit learning process across sub-nets,
the Switchable Output Layer (SOL) reduces representational interference and
improves optimization, without altering the shared backbone. We evaluate SOLAR
on five datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) using
four super-net backbones (ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, WideResNet-40-2, and
MobileNetV2) for two OFA training frameworks (OATS and SNNs). Experiments show
that SOLAR outperforms the baseline methods: compared to OATS, it improves
accuracy of sub-nets up to 1.26 %, 4.71 %, 1.67 %, and 1.76 %, and robustness
up to 9.01 %, 7.71 %, 2.72 %, and 1.26 % on SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and
CIFAR-100, respectively. Compared to SNNs, it improves TinyImageNet accuracy by
up to 2.93 %, 2.34 %, and 1.35 % using ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, and
MobileNetV2 backbones (with 8 sub-nets), respectively.

TL;DR: LVADNet3D是一种3D卷积自编码器，用于从稀疏速度向量输入重建高分辨率心室内血流速度场，优于标准UNet3D模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床成像在左心室辅助装置（LVAD）患者中难以提供高质量血流速度数据，而计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟虽高保真但不适合常规临床使用。

Method: 提出LVADNet3D，结合混合下采样和更深的编码器-解码器架构，利用CFD生成的高分辨率合成数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: LVADNet3D在不同输入配置下均优于UNet3D，重建误差更低，PSNR更高。

Conclusion: LVADNet3D为LVAD患者的心室内血流评估提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of intraventricular blood flow is essential for
evaluating hemodynamic conditions in patients supported by Left Ventricular
Assist Devices (LVADs). However, clinical imaging is either incompatible with
LVADs or yields sparse, low-quality velocity data. While Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide high-fidelity data, they are computationally
intensive and impractical for routine clinical use. To address this, we propose
LVADNet3D, a 3D convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs full-resolution
intraventricular velocity fields from sparse velocity vector inputs. In
contrast to a standard UNet3D model, LVADNet3D incorporates hybrid downsampling
and a deeper encoder-decoder architecture with increased channel capacity to
better capture spatial flow patterns. To train and evaluate the models, we
generate a high-resolution synthetic dataset of intraventricular blood flow in
LVAD-supported hearts using CFD simulations. We also investigate the effect of
conditioning the models on anatomical and physiological priors. Across various
input configurations, LVADNet3D outperforms the baseline UNet3D model, yielding
lower reconstruction error and higher PSNR results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的优化目标，同时解决注意力机制的可解释性和效率问题，通过压缩和广播机制实现线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的注意力机制虽然成功，但其前向传递的优化目标不明确，且自注意力的二次复杂度限制了效率。

Method: 通过展开优化目标，提出了一种可解释且高效的注意力机制（CBSA），通过压缩和广播操作实现线性复杂度。

Result: 实验表明CBSA在多个视觉任务上表现优异，且能泛化为现有注意力机制的特例。

Conclusion: CBSA同时解决了可解释性和效率问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical
success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass
are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is
increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the
interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified
optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling
the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and
efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional
structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the
contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism
can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms
as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance
and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DES-MoE框架通过动态专家隔离技术，解决了多领域适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型在多领域适应中存在灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法计算成本高或需分领域训练。

Method: DES-MoE提出自适应路由器、实时专家-领域关联映射和三阶段自适应微调计划。

Result: 在六个领域上，DES-MoE性能与单领域ESFT相当，遗忘减少89%，收敛速度提升68%。

Conclusion: 动态专家隔离是MoE多任务适应的可扩展范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer immense capacity via sparsely gated
expert subnetworks, yet adapting them to multiple domains without catastrophic
forgetting remains an open challenge. Existing approaches either incur
prohibitive computation, suffer cross-domain interference, or require separate
runs per domain. We propose DES-MoE, a dynamic expert specialization framework
for multi-domain adaptation of Mixture-of-Experts models. DES-MoE addresses
catastrophic forgetting through three innovations: (1) an adaptive router
balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific updates via
distillation, (2) real-time expert-domain correlation mapping to isolate
domain-specific gradients, and (3) a three-phase adaptive fine-tuning schedule
that progressively freezes non-specialized parameters. Evaluated on six domains
(math, code, law, etc.), DES-MoE matches single-domain ESFT performance while
training one unified model, reduces forgetting by 89% compared to full
fine-tuning as domains scale from 2 to 6, and achieves 68% faster convergence
than conventional methods. Our work establishes dynamic expert isolation as a
scalable paradigm for multi-task MoE adaptation.

Motivation: 由于社交媒体上虚假信息的快速传播及其社会影响，文本假新闻检测变得至关重要。

Result: 实验表明，DRES在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于实例硬度的表示选择和动态集成选择能有效提升假新闻检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid spread of information via social media has made text-based fake
news detection critically important due to its societal impact. This paper
presents a novel detection method called Dynamic Representation and Ensemble
Selection (DRES) for identifying fake news based solely on text. DRES leverages
instance hardness measures to estimate the classification difficulty for each
news article across multiple textual feature representations. By dynamically
selecting the textual representation and the most competent ensemble of
classifiers for each instance, DRES significantly enhances prediction accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that DRES achieves notable improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of representation
selection based on instance hardness and dynamic ensemble selection in boosting
performance. Codes and data are available at:

Motivation: 研究对比学习问题中局部最优解的复杂性，填补了现有理论空白。

Method: 通过证明离散和连续情况下的PLS和CLS难度，分析了对比学习问题的局部最优解复杂性。

Result: 发现多项式时间算法无法找到局部最优解，除非PLS或CLS包含于P类问题。

Conclusion: 对比学习问题中寻找局部最优解具有高复杂性，即使在高维情况下也需指数时间。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a powerful technique for discovering meaningful data
representations by optimizing objectives based on $\textit{contrastive
information}$, often given as a set of weighted triplets $\{(x_i, y_i^+,
z_{i}^-)\}_{i = 1}^m$ indicating that an "anchor" $x_i$ is more similar to a
"positive" example $y_i$ than to a "negative" example $z_i$. The goal is to
find representations (e.g., embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or a tree metric)
where anchors are placed closer to positive than to negative examples. While
finding $\textit{global}$ optima of contrastive objectives is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard, the complexity of finding $\textit{local}$ optima --
representations that do not improve by local search algorithms such as
gradient-based methods -- remains open. Our work settles the complexity of
finding local optima in various contrastive learning problems by proving
$\mathsf{PLS}$-hardness in discrete settings (e.g., maximize satisfied
triplets) and $\mathsf{CLS}$-hardness in continuous settings (e.g., minimize
Triplet Loss), where $\mathsf{PLS}$ (Polynomial Local Search) and
$\mathsf{CLS}$ (Continuous Local Search) are well-studied complexity classes
capturing local search dynamics in discrete and continuous optimization,
respectively. Our results imply that no polynomial time algorithm (local search
or otherwise) can find a local optimum for various contrastive learning
problems, unless $\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq
\mathsf{P}$ for continuous problems). Even in the unlikely scenario that
$\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$), our
reductions imply that there exist instances where local search algorithms need
exponential time to reach a local optimum, even for $d=1$ (embeddings on a
line).

TL;DR: FedEL是一个联邦弹性学习框架，通过窗口训练和动态张量选择提升效率，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因设备硬件异构性导致的训练延迟问题，现有方法存在准确性下降或更新滞后等不足。

Method: 引入窗口训练过程，动态选择重要张量，协调运行时预算，并调整张量重要性以减少数据异构性带来的偏差。

Result: 实验显示FedEL在时间效率上比基线方法提升3.87倍，同时保持或超过最终测试准确性。

Conclusion: FedEL有效平衡了训练效率和模型准确性，适用于异构设备环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train
machine learning models while maintaining data privacy. However, the
heterogeneous hardware capabilities of devices often result in significant
training delays, as straggler clients with limited resources prolong the
aggregation process. Existing solutions such as client selection, asynchronous
FL, and partial training partially address these challenges but encounter
issues such as reduced accuracy, stale updates, and compromised model
performance due to inconsistent training contributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FedEL, a federated elastic learning framework that
enhances training efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. FedEL introduces
a novel window-based training process, sliding the window to locate the
training part of the model and dynamically selecting important tensors for
training within a coordinated runtime budget. This approach ensures progressive
and balanced training across all clients, including stragglers. Additionally,
FedEL employs a tensor importance adjustment module, harmonizing local and
global tensor importance to mitigate biases caused by data heterogeneity. The
experiment results show that FedEL achieves up to 3.87x improvement in
time-to-accuracy compared to baselines while maintaining or exceeding final
test accuracy.

Result: 新方法满足可审计性和修改需求，并揭示了多校准损失景观和几何特性。

Conclusion: 研究为多校准算法和多群体审计提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Calibration is a critical property for establishing the trustworthiness of
predictors that provide uncertainty estimates. Multicalibration is a
strengthening of calibration which requires that predictors be calibrated on a
potentially overlapping collection of subsets of the domain. As
multicalibration grows in popularity with practitioners, an essential question
is: how do we measure how multicalibrated a predictor is? B{\l}asiok et al.
(2023) considered this question for standard calibration by introducing the
distance to calibration framework (dCE) to understand how calibration metrics
relate to each other and the ground truth. Building on the dCE framework, we
consider the auditability of the distance to multicalibration of a predictor
$f$.
  We begin by considering two natural generalizations of dCE to multiple
subgroups: worst group dCE (wdMC), and distance to multicalibration (dMC). We
argue that there are two essential properties of any multicalibration error
metric: 1) the metric should capture how much $f$ would need to be modified in
order to be perfectly multicalibrated; and 2) the metric should be auditable in
an information theoretic sense. We show that wdMC and dMC each fail to satisfy
one of these two properties, and that similar barriers arise when considering
the auditability of general distance to multigroup fairness notions. We then
propose two (equivalent) multicalibration metrics which do satisfy these
requirements: 1) a continuized variant of dMC; and 2) a distance to
intersection multicalibration, which leans on intersectional fairness
desiderata. Along the way, we shed light on the loss-landscape of distance to
multicalibration and the geometry of the set of perfectly multicalibrated
predictors. Our findings may have implications for the development of stronger
multicalibration algorithms as well as multigroup auditing more generally.

Result: 实验表明，多模态方法显著优于单模态方法。

Conclusion: 结合文本与图结构信息能更有效识别高风险用户。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the detection of potentially dangerous tendencies of
social media users in an innovative multimodal way. We integrate Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly,
we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis,
sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from
social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph
based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional
network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content
dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user
behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models
above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and
effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media
datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant
improvement over single-modality methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中不同目标冲突会导致梯度干扰，减缓收敛并降低模型性能。

Method: 通过计算梯度干扰构建干扰图，用贪心图着色将任务分组，每次训练仅激活一组任务，并动态调整分组。

Result: 在六个数据集上实验表明，该方法优于基线方法和当前最优的多任务优化器。

Conclusion: 通过任务分组减少梯度干扰，能有效提升多任务学习的模型性能。

Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning,
gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the final
model's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computes
gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies
greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each
other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are
activated. The grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task
relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch
contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method
improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer
without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in
compatible directions, model performance will be improved rather than impeded.
Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware
graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art
multi-task optimizers.

TL;DR: PTQTP是一种新型的三元权重后训练量化框架，通过结构化分解实现高效推理，显著优于现有低比特量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在极低比特量化中计算效率与模型表达能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 将权重矩阵分解为结构化三元{-1, 0, 1}平面，采用2x1.58比特表示，实现无乘法推理。

Result: 在LLaMA3.x和Qwen3模型上，PTQTP显著优于现有方法，数学推理保留率达82.4%。

Conclusion: PTQTP是资源受限环境下高效部署大语言模型的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) to extremely
low bit-widths remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between
computational efficiency and model expressiveness. While existing ultra-low-bit
PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms,
they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational
overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to
Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes
weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit
representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to
1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel
structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded
progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2)
model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural
modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for
mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across
LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP
significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4%
mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP
approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training
performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU
days for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical
solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Result: 持久球在多种任务（如回归、分类）中表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 持久球是最接近Wasserstein几何的线性空间表示，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: We introduce persistence spheres, a novel functional representation of
persistence diagrams. Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images,
landscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous
mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein
distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a
theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making
persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the
Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for
persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and
parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse
regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series,
graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres
consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to
persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因固定推理预算导致的效率低下问题，避免过度计算。

Method: 结合token级模型不确定性和输入复杂度估计，采用三种策略（UA-αS、CG-αI、HAC）动态调整推理速度。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和SVAMP数据集上，HAC实现了更优的准确率-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: Adaptive Overclocking通过减少过度计算，显著提升了推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from computational inefficiency
due to overthinking, where a fixed reasoning budget fails to match the varying
complexity of tasks. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Overclocking, a
method that makes the overclocking hyperparameter $\alpha$ dynamic and
context-aware. Our method adjusts reasoning speed in real time through two
complementary signals: (1) token-level model uncertainty for fine-grained
step-wise control, and (2) input complexity estimation for informed
initialization. We implement this approach with three strategies:
Uncertainty-Aware Alpha Scheduling (UA-$\alpha$S), Complexity-Guided Alpha
Initialization (CG-$\alpha$I), and a Hybrid Adaptive Control (HAC) that
combines both. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and SVAMP show that HAC achieves
superior accuracy-latency trade-offs, reducing unnecessary computation on
simple problems while allocating more resources to challenging ones. By
mitigating overthinking, Adaptive Overclocking enhances both efficiency and
overall reasoning performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine
learning models. However, when training data follows a long-tailed
distribution, the model's ability to accurately detect OOD samples is
significantly compromised, due to the confusion between OOD samples and
head/tail classes. To distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes,
the separate class learning (SCL) approach has emerged as a promising solution,
which separately conduct head-specific and tail-specific class learning. To
this end, we examine the limitations of existing works of SCL and reveal that
the OOD detection performance is notably influenced by the use of static
scaling temperature value and the presence of uninformative outliers. To
mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel approach termed Refined Separate
Class Learning (RSCL), which leverages dynamic class-wise temperature
adjustment to modulate the temperature parameter for each in-distribution class
and informative outlier mining to identify diverse types of outliers based on
their affinity with head and tail classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RSCL achieves superior OOD detection performance while improving the
classification accuracy on in-distribution data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于共形化分位数回归的贝叶斯超参数优化方法，解决了高斯过程在分类超参数环境中的不足，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程（GP）在贝叶斯超参数优化中表现优异，但在分类超参数环境或假设不成立时表现不佳。共形化分位数回归可以弥补这些不足，同时提供鲁棒的校准保证。

Method: 研究通过解决序列获取中的反馈协变量偏移，并整合更广泛的代理架构和获取函数，改进了早期工作。

Result: 实验表明，提出的分位数代理架构和获取函数性能优于现有分位数文献，同时验证了共形化对校准和搜索性能的积极影响。

Conclusion: 共形化分位数回归在超参数优化中表现出色，尤其在分类超参数环境中优于传统方法。

Abstract: Bayesian hyperparameter optimization relies heavily on Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogates, due to robust distributional posteriors and strong performance on
limited training samples. GPs however underperform in categorical
hyperparameter environments or when assumptions of normality,
heteroskedasticity and symmetry are excessively challenged. Conformalized
quantile regression can address these estimation weaknesses, while still
providing robust calibration guarantees. This study builds upon early work in
this area by addressing feedback covariate shift in sequential acquisition and
integrating a wider range of surrogate architectures and acquisition functions.
Proposed algorithms are rigorously benchmarked against a range of state of the
art hyperparameter optimization methods (GP, TPE and SMAC). Findings identify
quantile surrogate architectures and acquisition functions yielding superior
performance to the current quantile literature, while validating the beneficial
impact of conformalization on calibration and search performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多变量时间序列预测研究多从整体角度评估模型，忽略了核心组件的个体贡献，导致关键问题未被解决。

Method: 系统分解深度MTSF方法的核心组件（如序列分块标记化、通道独立策略等），并提出TSGym进行细粒度组件选择和自动化模型构建。

Conclusion: TSGym通过组件级分析和自动化构建，提升了模型的适应性和鲁棒性，为MTSF任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, deep learning has driven significant advancements in multivariate
time series forecasting (MTSF) tasks. However, much of the current research in
MTSF tends to evaluate models from a holistic perspective, which obscures the
individual contributions and leaves critical issues unaddressed. Adhering to
the current modeling paradigms, this work bridges these gaps by systematically
decomposing deep MTSF methods into their core, fine-grained components like
series-patching tokenization, channel-independent strategy, attention modules,
or even Large Language Models and Time-series Foundation Models. Through
extensive experiments and component-level analysis, our work offers more
profound insights than previous benchmarks that typically discuss models as a
whole.
  Furthermore, we propose a novel automated solution called TSGym for MTSF
tasks. Unlike traditional hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture searching
or fixed model selection, TSGym performs fine-grained component selection and
automated model construction, which enables the creation of more effective
solutions tailored to diverse time series data, therefore enhancing model
transferability across different data sources and robustness against
distribution shifts. Extensive experiments indicate that TSGym significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art MTSF and AutoML methods. All code is
publicly available on https://github.com/SUFE-AILAB/TSGym.

Result: 研究发现表格指标对深度RL性能预测有限，表示难度是主导因素。

Conclusion: 强调需要新的表示感知难度指标，pharos库为此提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Principled evaluation is critical for progress in deep reinforcement learning
(RL), yet it lags behind the theory-driven benchmarks of tabular RL. While
tabular settings benefit from well-understood hardness measures like MDP
diameter and suboptimality gaps, deep RL benchmarks are often chosen based on
intuition and popularity. This raises a critical question: can tabular hardness
metrics be adapted to guide non-tabular benchmarking? We investigate this
question and reveal a fundamental gap. Our primary contribution is
demonstrating that the difficulty of non-tabular environments is dominated by a
factor that tabular metrics ignore: representation hardness. The same
underlying MDP can pose vastly different challenges depending on whether the
agent receives state vectors or pixel-based observations. To enable this
analysis, we introduce \texttt{pharos}, a new open-source library for
principled RL benchmarking that allows for systematic control over both
environment structure and agent representations. Our extensive case study using
\texttt{pharos} shows that while tabular metrics offer some insight, they are
poor predictors of deep RL agent performance on their own. This work highlights
the urgent need for new, representation-aware hardness measures and positions
\texttt{pharos} as a key tool for developing them.

Abstract: The integration of solar power has been increasing as the green energy
transition rolls out. The penetration of solar power challenges the grid
stability and energy scheduling, due to its intermittent energy generation.
Accurate and near real-time solar power prediction is of critical importance to
tolerant and support the permeation of distributed and volatile solar power
production in the energy system. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning
based ultra-short-term solar power prediction with data reconstruction. We
decompose the data for the prediction to facilitate extensive exploration of
the spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. Particularly, we
reconstruct the data into low- and high-frequency components, using ensemble
empirical model decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). We integrate
meteorological data with those two components, and employ deep-learning models
to capture long- and short-term dependencies towards the target prediction
period. In this way, we excessively exploit the features in historical data in
predicting a ultra-short-term solar power production. Furthermore, as
ultra-short-term prediction is vulnerable to local optima, we modify the
optimization in our deep-learning training by penalizing long prediction
intervals. Numerical experiments with diverse settings demonstrate that,
compared to baseline models, the proposed method achieves improved
generalization in data reconstruction and higher prediction accuracy for
ultra-short-term solar power production.

Result: 在OpenML上的实验表明，GRPOformer在多样任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GRPOformer为RL在HPO中的应用提供了新思路，展示了其高效和稳定的优势。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a critical role in improving model
performance. Transformer-based HPO methods have shown great potential; however,
existing approaches rely heavily on large-scale historical optimization
trajectories and lack effective reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, thereby
limiting their efficiency and performance improvements. Inspired by the success
of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in large language models (LLMs),
we propose GRPOformer -- a novel hyperparameter optimization framework that
integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with Transformers. In GRPOformer,
Transformers are employed to generate new hyperparameter configurations from
historical optimization trajectories, while GRPO enables rapid trajectory
construction and optimization strategy learning from scratch. Moreover, we
introduce Policy Churn Regularization (PCR) to enhance the stability of GRPO
training. Experimental results on OpenML demonstrate that GRPOformer
consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks, offering new
insights into the application of RL for HPO.

Conclusion: 该方法在可再生能源场景预测中表现出色，兼具灵活性和可解释性。

Abstract: To address the intermittency of renewable energy source (RES) generation,
scenario forecasting offers a series of stochastic realizations for predictive
objects with superior flexibility and direct views. Based on a long time-series
perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power
and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed
for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex
spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain
behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance
normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and
variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information,
forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the
synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities.
Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty
representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 简化Transformer模型85%仅导致性能下降2-3%，而LSTM对简化更敏感。

Conclusion: 模型简化可以显著减少计算成本，同时保持预测准确性，为更高效和可扩展的PPM解决方案铺平道路。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to forecast the future behavior of
ongoing process instances using historical event data, enabling proactive
decision-making. While recent advances rely heavily on deep learning models
such as LSTMs and Transformers, their high computational cost hinders practical
adoption. Prior work has explored data reduction techniques and alternative
feature encodings, but the effect of simplifying model architectures themselves
remains underexplored. In this paper, we analyze how reducing model complexity,
both in terms of parameter count and architectural depth, impacts predictive
performance, using two established PPM approaches. Across five diverse event
logs, we show that shrinking the Transformer model by 85% results in only a
2-3% drop in performance across various PPM tasks, while the LSTM proves
slightly more sensitive, particularly for waiting time prediction. Overall, our
findings suggest that substantial model simplification can preserve predictive
accuracy, paving the way for more efficient and scalable PPM solutions.

Conclusion: FiD-GP在压缩、计算效率和性能上均表现优异，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression
framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a
neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace.
Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral
regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace
with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection
mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework
in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation
ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight
spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and
significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost
of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights
employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression,
image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection
benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude,
compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and
matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we unroll the dynamics of the dual ascent (DA) algorithm in
two coupled graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve constrained optimization
problems. The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find
a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a
given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates
to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror
the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We
propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and
dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields
near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.

Abstract: Time series data is a prevalent form of data found in various fields. It
consists of a series of measurements taken over time. Forecasting is a crucial
application of time series models, where future values are predicted based on
historical data. Accurate forecasting is essential for making well-informed
decisions across industries. When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), precise
predictions play a key role in planning infrastructure development, load
balancing, and energy management. This study introduces a BI-LSTM embedding
denoising autoencoder model (BDM) designed to address time series problems,
focusing on short-term EV charging load prediction. The performance of the
proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark models like
Transformer, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Based on the results of the study, the
proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in four of the five-time steps,
demonstrating its effectiveness for time series forecasting. This research
makes a significant contribution to enhancing time series forecasting, thereby
improving decision-making processes.

Result: 在基加利首次绘制了200米分辨率的PM2.5污染地图，发现污染水平极高；模拟北京数据验证了方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法可全球推广，填补城市空气质量信息空白，助力公共卫生决策。

Abstract: Low-cost mobile sensors can be used to collect PM$_{2.5}$ concentration data
throughout an entire city. However, identifying air pollution hotspots from the
data is challenging due to the uneven spatial sampling, temporal variations in
the background air quality, and the dynamism of urban air pollution sources.
This study proposes a method to identify urban PM$_{2.5}$ hotspots that
addresses these challenges, involving four steps: (1) equip citizen scientists
with mobile PM$_{2.5}$ sensors while they travel; (2) normalise the raw data to
remove the influence of background ambient pollution levels; (3) fit a Gaussian
process regression model to the normalised data and (4) calculate a grid of
spatially explicit 'hotspot scores' using the probabilistic framework of
Gaussian processes, which conveniently summarise the relative pollution levels
throughout the city. We apply our method to create the first ever map of
PM$_{2.5}$ pollution in Kigali, Rwanda, at a 200m resolution. Our results
suggest that the level of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ pollution in Kigali is dangerously
high, and we identify the hotspots in Kigali where pollution consistently
exceeds the city-wide average. We also evaluate our method using simulated
mobile sensing data for Beijing, China, where we find that the hotspot scores
are probabilistically well calibrated and accurately reflect the 'ground truth'
spatial profile of PM$_{2.5}$ pollution. Thanks to the use of open-source
software, our method can be re-applied in cities throughout the world with a
handful of low-cost sensors. The method can help fill the gap in urban air
quality information and empower public health officials.

Abstract: In the era of the digitally driven economy, where there has been an
exponential surge in digital payment systems and other online activities,
various forms of fraudulent activities have accompanied the digital growth, out
of which credit card fraud has become an increasingly significant threat. To
deal with this, real-time fraud detection is essential for financial security
but remains challenging due to high transaction volumes and the complexity of
modern fraud patterns. This study presents a comprehensive performance
comparison between traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM,
Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and ensemble methods like Stacking and Voting
Classifier for detecting credit card fraud on a heavily imbalanced public
dataset, where the number of fraudulent transactions is 492 out of 284,807
total transactions. Application-specific preprocessing techniques were applied,
and the models were evaluated using various performance metrics. The ensemble
methods achieved an almost perfect precision of around 0.99, but traditional
methods demonstrated superior performance in terms of recall, which highlights
the trade-off between false positives and false negatives. The comprehensive
comparison reveals distinct performance strengths and limitations for each
algorithm, offering insights to guide practitioners in selecting the most

Abstract: Many common estimators in machine learning and causal inference are linear
smoothers, where the prediction is a weighted average of the training outcomes.
Some estimators, such as ordinary least squares and kernel ridge regression,
allow for arbitrarily negative weights, which improve feature imbalance but
often at the cost of increased dependence on parametric modeling assumptions
and higher variance. By contrast, estimators like importance weighting and
random forests (sometimes implicitly) restrict weights to be non-negative,
reducing dependence on parametric modeling and variance at the cost of worse
imbalance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that directly
penalizes the level of extrapolation, replacing the current practice of a hard
non-negativity constraint with a soft constraint and corresponding
hyperparameter. We derive a worst-case extrapolation error bound and introduce
a novel "bias-bias-variance" tradeoff, encompassing biases due to feature
imbalance, model misspecification, and estimator variance; this tradeoff is
especially pronounced in high dimensions, particularly when positivity is poor.
We then develop an optimization procedure that regularizes this bound while
minimizing imbalance and outline how to use this approach as a sensitivity
analysis for dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through synthetic experiments and a real-world
application, involving the generalization of randomized controlled trial
estimates to a target population of interest.

Abstract: The aerodynamic optimization of cars requires close collaboration between
aerodynamicists and stylists, while slow, expensive simulations remain a
bottleneck. Surrogate models have been shown to accurately predict aerodynamics
within the design space for which they were trained. However, many of these
models struggle to scale to higher resolutions because of the 3D nature of the
problem and data scarcity. We propose Progressive Multi-Resolution Training
(PMRT), a probabilistic multi-resolution training schedule that enables
training a U-Net to predict the drag coefficient ($c_d$) and high-resolution
velocity fields (512 x 128 x 128) in 24 hours on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, 7x
cheaper than the high-resolution-only baseline, with similar accuracy. PMRT
samples batches from three resolutions based on probabilities that change
during training, starting with an emphasis on lower resolutions and gradually
shifting toward higher resolutions. Since this is a training methodology, it
can be adapted to other high-resolution-focused backbones. We also show that a
single model can be trained across five datasets from different solvers,
including a real-world dataset, by conditioning on the simulation parameters.
In the DrivAerML dataset, our models achieve a $c_d$ $R^2$ of 0.975, matching
literature baselines at a fraction of the training cost.

Conclusion: D-RF模型为边缘平台上的长序列建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for
effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic
oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently
extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into
spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence
modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a
trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal
tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a
Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a
multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific
frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons,
thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation.
Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma
structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity,
reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long
sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains
competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without
compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore
its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling
on edge platforms.

Motivation: 传统信号处理方法依赖专家知识和手动工程，适应性差；LLM具有强大的推理和跨模态能力，适合自动化信号处理。

Result: 在雷达目标检测等任务中，SignalLLM在少样本和零样本设置下优于传统和现有LLM方法。

Conclusion: SignalLLM展示了LLM在信号处理中的潜力，为自动化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven,
often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert
knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and
generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge,
in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as
powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these
potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent
framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are
limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a
principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into
structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,
followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through
prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model
invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design
enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different
signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the
versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in
communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity
recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior
performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in
few-shot and zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法主要适用于静态环境，而动态环境中的约束满足问题尚未充分解决。

Result: 通过实验验证了条件方法的有效性，并与无条件方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态环境中表现出色，为约束满足问题提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Leveraging machine learning methods to solve constraint satisfaction problems
has shown promising, but they are mostly limited to a static situation where
the problem description is completely known and fixed from the beginning. In
this work we present a new approach to constraint satisfaction and optimization
in dynamically changing environments, particularly when variables in the
problem are statistically independent. We frame it as a reinforcement learning
problem and introduce a conditional policy generator by borrowing the idea of
class conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Assuming that the
problem includes both static and dynamic constraints, the former are used in a
reward formulation to guide the policy training such that it learns to map to a
probabilistic distribution of solutions satisfying static constraints from a
noise prior, which is similar to a generator in GANs. On the other hand,
dynamic constraints in the problem are encoded to different class labels and
fed with the input noise. The policy is then simultaneously updated for maximum
likelihood of correctly classifying given the dynamic conditions in a
supervised manner. We empirically demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment
with a multi-modal constraint satisfaction problem and compare between
unconditional and conditional cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决粗粒度势在模拟中因未采样构象而退化的问题，避免生成大量全原子数据的计算负担。

Method: 基于CGSchNet模型，利用RMSD从MD模拟中选择帧，动态生成数据并训练神经网络势。

Result: 在Chignolin蛋白上，模型在TICA空间的W1指标提升了33.05%。

Conclusion: 主动学习框架有效探索未采样构象，提升粗粒度势的准确性。

Abstract: Machine learned coarse grained (CG) potentials are fast, but degrade over
time when simulations reach undersampled biomolecular conformations, and
generating widespread all atom (AA) data to combat this is computationally
infeasible. We propose a novel active learning framework for CG neural network
potentials in molecular dynamics (MD). Building on the CGSchNet model, our
method employs root mean squared deviation (RMSD) based frame selection from MD
simulations in order to generate data on the fly by querying an oracle during
the training of a neural network potential. This framework preserves CG level
efficiency while correcting the model at precise, RMSD identified coverage
gaps. By training CGSchNet, a coarse grained neural network potential, we
empirically show that our framework explores previously unseen configurations
and trains the model on unexplored regions of conformational space. Our active
learning framework enables a CGSchNet model trained on the Chignolin protein to
achieve a 33.05% improvement in the Wasserstein 1 (W1) metric in Time lagged
Independent Component Analysis (TICA) space on an in house benchmark suite.

*Zihan Liang,Ziwen Pan,Ruoxuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果表示学习框架，用于处理多模态临床记录中的缺失数据问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记常缺失，且缺失模式非随机，影响患者表示学习。

Method: 结合MMNAR感知的模态融合、对比学习的模态重建和多任务预测模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和eICU数据集上，AUC提升最高达13.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效利用缺失数据，提升临床预测任务的性能。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich patient information, such as diagnoses or
medications, making them valuable for patient representation learning. Recent
advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract
meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are
often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of
patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations
can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or
radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by
clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality
missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation
learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in
multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion
component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning
on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven
assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning
to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask
outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from
specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across
MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving
up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU
admission.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一图表示，难以捕捉多元时间序列的复杂关系。

Method: 提出PMGC框架，结合静态图和动态图，并通过图凝聚损失函数调节。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMGC通过多图策略和前瞻性图设计，显著提升了异常检测效果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for
numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series
anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model
inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph
representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse
relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose
the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD.
PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with
a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph
cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function
promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable
long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we
introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of
traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with
unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately
reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby
enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to
existing TSAD techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规的启发，满足用户“被遗忘权”的需求。

Method: 结合分层数据驱动的重要性评分方案和师生蒸馏技术，通过重要性加权损失实现目标遗忘。

Conclusion: TraceHiding是首个针对轨迹数据的系统化机器遗忘研究，提供了可复现的流程和工具。

Abstract: This work introduces TraceHiding, a scalable, importance-aware machine
unlearning framework for mobility trajectory data. Motivated by privacy
regulations such as GDPR and CCPA granting users "the right to be forgotten,"
TraceHiding removes specified user trajectories from trained deep models
without full retraining. It combines a hierarchical data-driven importance
scoring scheme with teacher-student distillation. Importance scores--computed
at token, trajectory, and user levels from statistical properties (coverage
diversity, entropy, length)--quantify each training sample's impact, enabling
targeted forgetting of high-impact data while preserving common patterns. The
student model retains knowledge on remaining data and unlearns targeted
trajectories through an importance-weighted loss that amplifies forgetting
signals for unique samples and attenuates them for frequent ones. We validate
on Trajectory--User Linking (TUL) tasks across three real-world higher-order
mobility datasets (HO-Rome, HO-Geolife, HO-NYC) and multiple architectures
(GRU, LSTM, BERT, ModernBERT, GCN-TULHOR), against strong unlearning baselines
including SCRUB, NegGrad, NegGrad+, Bad-T, and Finetuning. Experiments under
uniform and targeted user deletion show TraceHiding, especially its
entropy-based variant, achieves superior unlearning accuracy, competitive
membership inference attack (MIA) resilience, and up to 40\times speedup over
retraining with minimal test accuracy loss. Results highlight robustness to
adversarial deletion of high-information users and consistent performance
across models. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of machine
unlearning for trajectory data, providing a reproducible pipeline with public
code and preprocessing tools.

Motivation: 传统确定性预测难以捕捉股票价格的不确定性和尾部事件，U-GNNs通过扩散模型实现概率预测。

Method: 采用U形编码器-解码器架构，结合跳跃连接和零填充池化操作，避免任意图粗化，并通过图卷积捕获局部依赖。

Result: U-GNNs在股票价格概率预测中表现出色。

Conclusion: U-GNNs为随机图信号生成和概率预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce U-shaped encoder-decoder graph neural networks (U-GNNs) for
stochastic graph signal generation using denoising diffusion processes. The
architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip
connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the
convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling
operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening,
with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This
technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper
levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the
original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic
forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount
-- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic
forecasting of stock prices.

Abstract: High-quality reference standard image data creation by neuroradiology experts
for automated clinical tools can be a powerful tool for neuroradiology &
artificial intelligence education. We developed a multimodal educational
approach for students and trainees during the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation
Lighthouse Challenge 2025, a landmark initiative to develop accurate brain
tumor segmentation algorithms. Fifty-six medical students & radiology trainees
volunteered to annotate brain tumor MR images for the BraTS challenges of 2023
& 2024, guided by faculty-led didactics on neuropathology MRI. Among the 56
annotators, 14 select volunteers were then paired with neuroradiology faculty
for guided one-on-one annotation sessions for BraTS 2025. Lectures on
neuroanatomy, pathology & AI, journal clubs & data scientist-led workshops were
organized online. Annotators & audience members completed surveys on their
perceived knowledge before & after annotations & lectures respectively.
Fourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data
annotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and
1200 segmentations in total. On a scale of 1-10, annotation coordinators
reported significant increase in familiarity with image segmentation software
pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6+/-2.9 to final
average of 8.9+/-1.1, and significant increase in familiarity with brain tumor
features pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6.2+/-2.4 to
final average of 8.1+/-1.2. We demonstrate an innovative offering for providing
neuroradiology & AI education through an image segmentation challenge to
enhance understanding of algorithm development, reinforce the concept of data

Motivation: 现有方法在图嵌入或离散空间中的扩散存在不可解释性和预测困难的问题。

Method: GraphWeave通过随机游走学习图模式，生成随机游走轨迹，并优化构建匹配轨迹的图。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，GraphWeave在多种图结构指标上优于现有方法，且速度更快。

Conclusion: GraphWeave是一种高效、简单且性能优越的图生成方法。

Abstract: Given a set of graphs from some unknown family, we want to generate new
graphs from that family. Recent methods use diffusion on either graph
embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to
embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph.
In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It
is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion
steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We
separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the
training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then
generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk
"trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal
graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly,
which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world
benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most
significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank,
cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x
faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only
a transformer and standard optimizers.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与复杂基线相当（相关性0.766 vs. 0.770，RMSE 4.452 vs. 4.501），同时显著降低架构复杂性和训练开销。

Conclusion: 基于算子的监督方法可替代复杂多组件训练策略，为生理建模提供更可扩展和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of personalized cardiovascular dynamics is crucial for
non-invasive monitoring and therapy planning. State-of-the-art physics-informed
neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with
adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation
constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training
and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment.
We investigate physics-informed neural operator learning models as efficient
supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge
distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet)
on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings
from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded
physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in
a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models
that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while
maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed
regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for
supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operator-supervised
approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766
vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural
complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization
coefficient and decreasing training overhead by 4%. Our results demonstrate
that operator-based supervision effectively replaces intricate multi-component
training strategies, offering a more scalable and interpretable approach to
physiological modeling with reduced implementation burden.

Motivation: 传统PP算法在非凸损失下收敛速度慢且误差邻域依赖方差，需改进。

Method: 提出SPRINT算法，结合方差缩减技术，优化随机梯度估计。

Result: SPRINT在多个真实数据集上表现优于SGD-GD，收敛更快且更稳定。

Conclusion: SPRINT在非凸PP任务中高效且稳定，解决了方差依赖问题。

Abstract: Performative prediction (PP) is an algorithmic framework for optimizing
machine learning (ML) models where the model's deployment affects the
distribution of the data it is trained on. Compared to traditional ML with
fixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as
a stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the
counterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution
shifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using
methods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient
descent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a
recent work established $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS
solutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is
still based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic
gradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error
neighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to
improve convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP,
particularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called
stochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and
establish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$.
Notably, the resulting error neighborhood is **independent** of the variance of
the stochastic gradients. Experiments on multiple real datasets with non-convex
models demonstrate that SPRINT outperforms SGD-GD in both convergence rate and
stability.

Result: VQEzy提供了全面的VQE参数初始化资源，支持未来研究。

Conclusion: VQEzy为VQE优化研究提供了重要支持，并将持续更新。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly
sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based
initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their
progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing
resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few
hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits,
and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy
spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110
instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories.
The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded
to support future research in VQE optimization.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理的训练方法在泛化性和新工具适应上表现不佳，而代码执行的结构与真实工作流相似，因此提出CodeGym框架。

Method: CodeGym将静态编程问题转化为多轮工具使用的交互式环境，提取原子函数为可调用工具，支持强化学习训练。

Conclusion: CodeGym为构建可扩展的通用强化学习环境提供了有效方案，能更好地对齐真实世界的工作流。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs), hereafter LLM agents, leverage
external tools to solve diverse tasks and interface with the real world.
However, current training practices largely rely on supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) over static trajectories or reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow tasks,
and generalize poorly beyond development settings, leading to brittleness with
new tools and unseen workflows. Because code execution reflects many structures
of real-world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building
agent training environments. Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a
scalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable
multi-turn tool-use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore
and master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems
into interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into
callable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool-execution
workflows. Models of varying sizes and chain-of-thought configurations, trained
in CodeGym, exhibit consistent out-of-distribution generalizability; for
example, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points
on the OOD benchmark $\tau$-Bench. These results highlight CodeGym as a step
toward scalable general-purpose RL environments that align with real-world
agent workflows.

TL;DR: WhENDS是一种新型无监督异常检测方法，通过估计分布统计量和应用白化变换来对齐时间上的正常边嵌入，解决了动态图中正常行为随时间变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的正常行为会随时间变化（NDS），现有方法假设正常模式稳定，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出WhENDS方法，通过分布统计和白化变换对齐正常边嵌入。

Result: 在四个动态图数据集上优于九个基线方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 解决NDS问题对动态图异常检测至关重要，WhENDS展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is a critical task with broad real-world
applications, including social networks, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Most
existing methods assume that normal patterns remain stable over time; however,
this assumption often fails in practice due to the phenomenon we refer to as
normality distribution shift (NDS), where normal behaviors evolve over time.
Ignoring NDS can lead models to misclassify shifted normal instances as
anomalies, degrading detection performance. To tackle this issue, we propose
WhENDS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that aligns normal edge
embeddings across time by estimating distributional statistics and applying
whitening transformations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used dynamic
graph datasets show that WhENDS consistently outperforms nine strong baselines,
achieving state-of-the-art results and underscoring the importance of
addressing NDS in dynamic graph anomaly detection.

Motivation: 切片Wasserstein距离（SW）在几何、生成模型和配准任务中广泛应用，但现有方法（如QSW）仍有改进空间。

Method: 通过贝叶斯优化（BO）学习投影方向，提出四种方法：BOSW（一次性优化）、RBOSW（周期性刷新）、ABOSW（自适应混合）和ARBOSW（重启混合）。

Result: 实验表明，ABOSW和ARBOSW在收敛性和性能上优于QSW及其变体，且运行时开销较小。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯优化的方法在SW方向学习中表现出色，为优化任务提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) reduces optimal transport on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ to a sum of one-dimensional projections, and thanks to this
efficiency, it is widely used in geometry, generative modeling, and
registration tasks. Recent work shows that quasi-Monte Carlo constructions for
computing SW (QSW) yield direction sets with excellent approximation error.
This paper presents an alternate, novel approach: learning directions with
Bayesian optimization (BO), particularly in settings where SW appears inside an
optimization loop (e.g., gradient flows). We introduce a family of drop-in
selectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit
sphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds
from competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and
ARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during
optimization. Our BO approaches can be composed with QSW and its variants
(demonstrated by ABOSW/ARBOSW) and require no changes to downstream losses or
gradients. We provide numerical experiments where our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance, and on the experimental suite of the original QSW
paper, we find that ABOSW and ARBOSW can achieve convergence comparable to the
best QSW variants with modest runtime overhead.

*Masako Kishida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Fazlyab的二次约束和半定规划框架，通过集成最坏情况条件风险值（WC-CVaR）来处理输入不确定性，适用于安全关键领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在输入不确定性下的安全性问题，特别是在尾事件严重性重要的场景。

Method: 结合WC-CVaR和基于矩的模糊集，扩展了输入不确定性的几何覆盖方法（如椭球、多面体、超平面）。

Result: 提出的条件仍可通过SDP验证，并明确考虑了尾风险，适用于控制系统的闭环可达性和分类问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算结构的同时，通过风险水平ε在保守性和尾事件容忍度之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a
fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and
expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP)
framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and
tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk
(WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The
resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk.
This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids,
polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains
where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of
control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical
experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism
for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of
prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MMIR) suffers from weak semantic grounding and
poor robustness under noisy or rare-class conditions. We propose MVCL-DAF++,
which extends MVCL-DAF with two key modules: (1) Prototype-aware contrastive

consistency; and (2) Coarse-to-fine attention fusion, integrating global
modality summaries with token-level features for hierarchical cross-modal
interaction. On MIntRec and MIntRec2.0, MVCL-DAF++ achieves new
state-of-the-art results, improving rare-class recognition by +1.05\% and
+4.18\% WF1, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
prototype-guided learning and coarse-to-fine fusion for robust multimodal

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，PGMA优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: PGMA通过动态图结构和时空相关性提取，显著提升了多变量时间序列异常检测的准确性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in
various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However,
existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph
structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex
spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes
a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with
the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation
strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure
to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and
temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal
correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real
datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms
state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used attribution method in explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI). In this paper, we introduce Path-Weighted
Integrated Gradients (PWIG), a generalization of IG that incorporates a
customizable weighting function into the attribution integral. This
modification allows for targeted emphasis along different segments of the path
between a baseline and the input, enabling improved interpretability, noise
mitigation, and the detection of path-dependent feature relevance. We establish
its theoretical properties and illustrate its utility through experiments on a
dementia classification task using the OASIS-1 MRI dataset. Attribution maps
generated by PWIG highlight clinically meaningful brain regions associated with
various stages of dementia, providing users with sharp and stable explanations.
The results suggest that PWIG offers a flexible and theoretically grounded
approach for enhancing attribution quality in complex predictive models.

Conclusion: BiLCNet在5G流量分类中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient traffic classification is vital for wireless network
management, especially under encrypted payloads and dynamic application
behavior, where traditional methods such as port-based identification and deep
packet inspection (DPI) are increasingly inadequate. This work explores the
feasibility of using physical channel data collected from the air interface of
5G Standalone (SA) networks for traffic sensing. We develop a preprocessing
pipeline to transform raw channel records into structured representations with
customized feature engineering to enhance downstream classification
performance. To jointly capture temporal dependencies and both local and global
structural patterns inherent in physical channel records, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture: BiLSTM-Conformer Network (BiLCNet), which integrates the
sequential modeling capability of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks
(BiLSTM) with the spatial feature extraction strength of Conformer blocks.
Evaluated on a noise-limited 5G SA dataset, our model achieves a classification
accuracy of 93.9%, outperforming a series of conventional machine learning and
deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization
ability under zero-shot transfer settings, validating its robustness across
traffic categories and varying environmental conditions.

TL;DR: Mamba架构在线性复杂度处理长序列时表现出色，但其非线性卷积引入的不对称性限制了对称模式的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Mamba架构与Transformer架构的根本差异，特别是Mamba在对称模式识别中的局限性。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成任务（如复合函数和逆序列匹配任务）验证Mamba的局限性。

Result: Mamba的非线性卷积导致不对称性偏差，使其难以识别对称模式或匹配逆序序列。

Conclusion: Mamba的局限性源于非线性卷积，而非SSM模块，这为未来序列模型的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to attention
mechanisms, with the Mamba architecture demonstrating impressive performance
and linear complexity for processing long sequences. However, the fundamental
differences between Mamba and Transformer architectures remain incompletely
understood. In this work, we use carefully designed synthetic tasks to reveal
Mamba's inherent limitations. Through experiments, we identify that Mamba's
nonlinear convolution introduces an asymmetry bias that significantly impairs
its ability to recognize symmetrical patterns and relationships. Using
composite function and inverse sequence matching tasks, we demonstrate that
Mamba strongly favors compositional solutions over symmetrical ones and
struggles with tasks requiring the matching of reversed sequences. We show
these limitations stem not from the SSM module itself but from the nonlinear
convolution preceding it, which fuses token information asymmetrically. These
insights provide a new understanding of Mamba's constraints and suggest
concrete architectural improvements for future sequence models.

TL;DR: UnCLe是一种针对持续学习环境的数据无关遗忘框架，解决了传统遗忘算法在持续学习中的性能下降和任务复发问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI安全和数据隐私问题推动了机器遗忘的发展，但现有算法仅适用于离线训练，无法适应持续学习环境。

Method: UnCLe利用超网络生成任务特定参数，通过将参数与噪声对齐实现数据无关的任务遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，UnCLe能在多个视觉数据集上高效执行学习和遗忘操作，对已学知识干扰最小。

Conclusion: UnCLe为持续学习环境提供了一种高效、数据无关的遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Growing concerns surrounding AI safety and data privacy have driven the
development of Machine Unlearning as a potential solution. However, current
machine unlearning algorithms are designed to complement the offline training
paradigm. The emergence of the Continual Learning (CL) paradigm promises
incremental model updates, enabling models to learn new tasks sequentially.
Naturally, some of those tasks may need to be unlearned to address safety or
privacy concerns that might arise. We find that applying conventional
unlearning algorithms in continual learning environments creates two critical
problems: performance degradation on retained tasks and task relapse, where
previously unlearned tasks resurface during subsequent learning. Furthermore,
most unlearning algorithms require data to operate, which conflicts with CL's
philosophy of discarding past data. A clear need arises for unlearning
algorithms that are data-free and mindful of future learning. To that end, we
propose UnCLe, an Unlearning framework for Continual Learning. UnCLe employs a
hypernetwork that learns to generate task-specific network parameters, using
task embeddings. Tasks are unlearned by aligning the corresponding generated
network parameters with noise, without requiring any data. Empirical
evaluations on several vision data sets demonstrate UnCLe's ability to
sequentially perform multiple learning and unlearning operations with minimal
disruption to previously acquired knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电池建模方法存在参数多、依赖标记数据或缺乏老化适应等问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: SeqBattNet由HRM-GRU编码器和基于ECM的解码器组成，仅需三个基本电池参数。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，SeqBattNet表现优于经典序列模型和PINN基线，RMSE更低且计算高效。

Conclusion: SeqBattNet为电池建模提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Accurate battery modeling is essential for reliable state estimation in
modern applications, such as predicting the remaining discharge time and
remaining discharge energy in battery management systems. Existing approaches
face several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of
parameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still
depend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we
propose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for
battery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.
SeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the
proposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging
adaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit
model (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together
with the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic
battery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves
robust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI,
RT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms
classical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE
while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较数据同化（DA）和基于似然的推断（LBI）在基于代理模型（ABMs）中的应用，发现LBI在代理级别推断更优，DA在聚合预测中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABMs中的潜在状态估计需要方法适应，传统DA方法在ABMs中面临挑战，需与LBI进行比较以明确各自优劣。

Method: 在Bounded-Confidence Model中比较DA和LBI的性能，评估其在代理级别和聚合级别的表现。

Result: LBI在代理级别推断更准确，DA在聚合预测中表现良好，两者在特定参数下表现相当。

Conclusion: DA适合聚合预测，LBI更适合代理级别推断，选择方法需根据具体需求。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data
Assimilation (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of
Agent-Based Models (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven
by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated
to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by
DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in
weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard
DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques,
or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a
model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise.
In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging
the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,
model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to
derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a
well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others
holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent
agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved
individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods
perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation
under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited
for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注性别和种族偏见，忽视了宗教身份。本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨LLMs中宗教的内部表示及其与暴力和地理的交叉关系。

Method: 使用机制解释性和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）通过Neuronpedia API，分析五个模型的潜在特征激活，测量宗教与暴力提示的重叠，并探究激活上下文中的语义模式。

Result: 五种宗教的内部凝聚力相当，但伊斯兰教更常与暴力语言相关；地理关联则反映现实宗教分布，揭示了模型如何嵌入事实分布和文化刻板印象。

Conclusion: 结构分析不仅有助于审计模型输出，还能揭示影响模型行为的内部表示，突显其重要性。

Abstract: Despite growing research on bias in large language models (LLMs), most work
has focused on gender and race, with little attention to religious identity.
This paper explores how religion is internally represented in LLMs and how it
intersects with concepts of violence and geography. Using mechanistic
interpretability and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) via the Neuronpedia API, we
analyze latent feature activations across five models. We measure overlap
between religion- and violence-related prompts and probe semantic patterns in
activation contexts. While all five religions show comparable internal
cohesion, Islam is more frequently linked to features associated with violent
language. In contrast, geographic associations largely reflect real-world
religious demographics, revealing how models embed both factual distributions
and cultural stereotypes. These findings highlight the value of structural
analysis in auditing not just outputs but also internal representations that
shape model behavior.

Conclusion: EFV和LCTK在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡，适用于实际图学习应用。

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of explicit feature maps based on topological
indices that represent each graph by a compact feature vector, enabling fast
and interpretable graph classification. Using radial basis function kernels on
these compact vectors, we define a measure of similarity between graphs. We
perform evaluation on standard molecular datasets and observe that
classification accuracies based on single topological-index feature vectors
underperform compared to state-of-the-art substructure-based kernels. However,
we achieve significantly faster Gram matrix evaluation -- up to $20\times$
faster -- compared to the Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree kernel. To enhance
performance, we propose two extensions: 1) concatenating multiple topological
indices into an \emph{Extended Feature Vector} (EFV), and 2) \emph{Linear
Combination of Topological Kernels} (LCTK) by linearly combining Radial Basis
Function kernels computed on feature vectors of individual topological graph
indices. These extensions deliver up to $12\%$ percent accuracy gains across
all the molecular datasets. A complexity analysis highlights the potential for
exponential quantum speedup for some of the vector components. Our results
indicate that LCTK and EFV offer a favourable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, making them strong candidates for practical graph learning
applications.

Abstract: This research investigates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can assist in
workload allocation strategies by detecting tasks with node affinity operators
(referred to as constraint operators), which constrain their execution to a
limited number of nodes. Using real-world Google Cluster Data (GCD) workload
traces and the AGOCS framework, the study extracts node attributes and task
constraints, then analyses them to identify suitable node-task pairings. It
focuses on tasks that can be executed on either a single node or fewer than a
thousand out of 12.5k nodes in the analysed GCD cluster. Task constraint
operators are compacted, pre-processed with one-hot encoding, and used as
features in a training dataset. Various ML classifiers, including Artificial
Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Ridge
Regression, Adaptive Boosting, and Bagging, are fine-tuned and assessed for
accuracy and F1-scores. The final ensemble voting classifier model achieved 98%
accuracy and a 1.5-1.8% misclassification rate for tasks with a single suitable
node.

Abstract: In this work, we consider learning over multitask graphs, where each agent
aims to estimate its own parameter vector. Although agents seek distinct
objectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where
relationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting
relationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between
agents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning
studies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this
work explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,
making them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant
transitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized
optimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual
costs, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote
piecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based
on the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning
approach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization
problem. Then, under convexity assumptions on the cost functions and
co-regularization, we establish that the proposed approach converges in the
mean-square-error sense within $O(\mu)$ of the optimal solution of the globally
regularized cost. For broader applicability and improved computational
efficiency, we also derive closed-form expressions for commonly used non-smooth
(and, possibly, non-convex) regularizers, such as the weighted sum of the
$\ell_0$-norm, $\ell_1$-norm, and elastic net regularization. Finally, we
illustrate both the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the approach
through simulations.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于条件分布测试问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for testing the equality of the
conditional distributions in a two-sample problem. This problem is most
relevant to transfer learning under covariate shift. Our framework is built on
neural network-based generative methods and sample splitting techniques by
transforming the conditional distribution testing problem into an unconditional
one. We introduce two special tests: the generative permutation-based
conditional distribution equality test and the generative classification
accuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. Theoretically, we
establish a minimax lower bound for statistical inference in testing the
equality of two conditional distributions under certain smoothness conditions.
We demonstrate that the generative permutation-based conditional distribution
equality test and its modified version can attain this lower bound precisely or
up to some iterated logarithmic factor. Moreover, we prove the testing
consistency of the generative classification accuracy-based conditional
distribution equality test. We also establish the convergence rate for the
learned conditional generator by deriving new results related to the
recently-developed offset Rademacher complexity and approximation properties
using neural networks. Empirically, we conduct numerical studies including
synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上提升了RL性能，减少了推理时的token消耗，且训练成本几乎不增加。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为插件模块增强其他先进RL方法，具有广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large
language models (LLMs) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent
line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages
automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to
generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key
limitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of
the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to
vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce
a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own
confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing
finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL
performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during
inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it
can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.

Abstract: In recent years, great progress has been made in the field of forecasting
meteorological variables. Recently, deep learning architectures have made a
major breakthrough in forecasting the daily average temperature over a ten-day
horizon. However, advances in forecasting events related to the maximum
temperature over short horizons remain a challenge for the community. A problem
that is even more complex consists in making predictions of the maximum daily
temperatures in the short, medium, and long term. In this work, we focus on
forecasting events related to the maximum daily temperature over medium-term
periods (90 days). Therefore, instead of addressing the problem from a
meteorological point of view, this article tackles it from a climatological
point of view. Due to the complexity of this problem, a common approach is to
frame the study as a temporal classification problem with the classes: maximum
temperature "above normal", "normal" or "below normal". From a practical point
of view, we created a large historical dataset (from 1981 to 2018) collecting
information from weather stations located in South America. In addition, we
also integrated exogenous information from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian
Ocean basins. We applied the AutoGluonTS platform to solve the above-mentioned
problem. This AutoML tool shows competitive forecasting performance with
respect to large operational platforms dedicated to tackling this
climatological problem; but with a "relatively" low computational cost in terms
of time and resources.

*Ting Han,Linara Adilova,Henning Petzka,Jens Kleesiek,Michael Kamp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了神经崩溃（neural collapse）和损失景观平坦度（flatness）在泛化中的作用，发现平坦度是泛化的更基本属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经崩溃和损失景观平坦度是否真正导致泛化，还是仅仅是训练动态的副产品。

Method: 利用grokking训练机制，将记忆和泛化分离，观察两种现象与泛化的关系。

Result: 平坦度在泛化开始时出现并预测泛化，而神经崩溃则不是必要条件。

Conclusion: 平坦度是泛化的更基本属性，神经崩溃是其副产品。

Abstract: Neural collapse, i.e., the emergence of highly symmetric, class-wise
clustered representations, is frequently observed in deep networks and is often
assumed to reflect or enable generalization. In parallel, flatness of the loss
landscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet,
the causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites
for generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle
these questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization
precedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from
training dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative
flatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently
predicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing
generalize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions
exhibit delayed generalization. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural
collapse implies relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining
their empirical co-occurrence. Our results support the view that relative
flatness is a potentially necessary and more fundamental property for
generalization, and demonstrate how grokking can serve as a powerful probe for
isolating its geometric underpinnings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据生成中数据有限或敏感时的挑战，捕捉高阶列间交互。

Method: 采用最大熵原理（MaxEnt），直接建模列间高阶交互（如成对、三阶等）。

Result: 在34个公开数据集中，68%的情况下优于现有方法，且参数更少。

Conclusion: GEM-T展示了低维、可解释相关性在表格数据中的重要性，是轻量高性能生成模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Tabular data dominates data science but poses challenges for generative
models, especially when the data is limited or sensitive. We present a novel
approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum
entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for
tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise,
third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing,
GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as
state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse
subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer
trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world
data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations,
provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore,
MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs.
categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data.
GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance
generative models for structured data.

Abstract: Neural fields offer continuous, learnable representations that extend beyond
traditional discrete formats in visual computing. We study the problem of
learning neural representations of repeated antiderivatives directly from a
function, a continuous analogue of summed-area tables. Although widely used in
discrete domains, such cumulative schemes rely on grids, which prevents their
applicability in continuous neural contexts. We introduce and analyze a range
of neural methods for repeated integration, including both adaptations of prior
work and novel designs. Our evaluation spans multiple input dimensionalities
and integration orders, assessing both reconstruction quality and performance
in downstream tasks such as filtering and rendering. These results enable
integrating classical cumulative operators into modern neural systems and offer
insights into learning tasks involving differential and integral operators.

Result: 实验证明MLLM-CD能有效从多模态非结构化数据中发现真实因素及其因果关系。

Conclusion: MLLM-CD为多模态因果发现提供了有效解决方案，展示了在多模态数据中的潜力。

Abstract: Uncovering cause-and-effect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific
progress. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal
discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly
prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent
of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two
primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal
interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2)
insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data.
To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for
multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key
components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine
multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample
pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal
relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal
counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by
incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships
among them from multimodal unstructured data.

Motivation: 基础模型的计算需求增加，低精度训练（如FP4）成为研究热点，但现有方法多为孤立解决方案且计算开销不明确。

Method: 引入基于量化梯度的微缩放量化框架，通过模拟器评估多种技术组合（如梯度近似、舍入策略和缩放方法）。

Result: 发现Hadamard变换、张量缩放和随机舍入的组合性能最佳，UE5M3作为缩放因子在范围和精度间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 论文为FP4训练提供了统一设计视角，并确定了最优技术组合，为低精度训练提供了实用指导。

Abstract: The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred
research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4})
formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While
numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they
often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear,
computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the
design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive,
quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows
for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different
stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a
simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study
across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image
classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically
evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient
approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which
configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We
find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully
combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We
further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a
good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational
overhead.

Abstract: World models have shown potential in artificial intelligence by predicting
and reasoning about world states beyond direct observations. However, existing
approaches are predominantly evaluated in synthetic environments or constrained
scene settings, limiting their validation in real-world contexts with broad
spatial coverage and complex semantics. Meanwhile, remote sensing applications
urgently require spatial reasoning capabilities for disaster response and urban
planning. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for
world modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as
direction-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically
consistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional
instruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing
World-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks
across four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural. RSWISE combines visual
fidelity assessment with instruction compliance evaluation using GPT-4o as a
semantic judge, ensuring models genuinely perform spatial reasoning rather than
simple replication. Afterwards, we present RemoteBAGEL, a unified multimodal
model fine-tuned on remote sensing data for spatial extrapolation tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RemoteBAGEL consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on RSWISE.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在通道异步的不规则多元时间序列上表现不佳，需改进。

Method: MTM结合多尺度标记混合和掩码拼接池化，增强通道注意力。

Result: 在真实数据集上，MTM性能最优，AUPRC提升达3.8%。

Conclusion: MTM有效解决通道异步问题，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is characterized by the lack of
synchronized observations across its different channels. In this paper, we
point out that this channel-wise asynchrony can lead to poor channel-wise
modeling of existing deep learning methods. To overcome this limitation, we
propose MTM, a multi-scale token mixing transformer for the classification of
IMTS. We find that the channel-wise asynchrony can be alleviated by
down-sampling the time series to coarser timescales, and propose to incorporate
a masked concat pooling in MTM that gradually down-samples IMTS to enhance the
channel-wise attention modules. Meanwhile, we propose a novel channel-wise
token mixing mechanism which proactively chooses important tokens from one
channel and mixes them with other channels, to further boost the channel-wise
learning of our model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets and
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that MTM consistently
achieves the best performance on all the benchmarks, with improvements of up to
3.8% in AUPRC for classification.

Conclusion: MSGAT-GRU是一个可扩展且通用的智能交通系统模型，提供可解释的信号支持交通管理。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road accidents remains challenging due to intertwined
spatial, temporal, and contextual factors in urban traffic. We propose
MSGAT-GRU, a multi-scale graph attention and recurrent model that jointly
captures localized and long-range spatial dependencies while modeling
sequential dynamics. Heterogeneous inputs, such as traffic flow, road
attributes, weather, and points of interest, are systematically fused to
enhance robustness and interpretability. On the Hybrid Beijing Accidents
dataset, MSGAT-GRU achieves an RMSE of 0.334 and an F1-score of 0.878,
consistently outperforming strong baselines. Cross-dataset evaluation on
METR-LA under a 1-hour horizon further supports transferability, with RMSE of
6.48 (vs. 7.21 for the GMAN model) and comparable MAPE. Ablations indicate that
three-hop spatial aggregation and a two-layer GRU offer the best
accuracy-stability trade-off. These results position MSGAT-GRU as a scalable
and generalizable model for intelligent transportation systems, providing
interpretable signals that can inform proactive traffic management and road
safety analytics.

Abstract: Global optimization, particularly for non-convex functions with multiple
local minima, poses significant challenges for traditional gradient-based
methods. While metaheuristic approaches offer empirical effectiveness, they
often lack theoretical convergence guarantees and may disregard available
gradient information. This paper introduces a novel gradient-based swarm
particle optimization method designed to efficiently escape local minima and
locate global optima. Our approach leverages a "Soft-min Energy" interacting
function, $J_\beta(\mathbf{x})$, which provides a smooth, differentiable
approximation of the minimum function value within a particle swarm. We define
a stochastic gradient flow in the particle space, incorporating a Brownian
motion term for exploration and a time-dependent parameter $\beta$ to control
smoothness, similar to temperature annealing. We theoretically demonstrate that
for strongly convex functions, our dynamics converges to a stationary point
where at least one particle reaches the global minimum, with other particles
exhibiting exploratory behavior. Furthermore, we show that our method
facilitates faster transitions between local minima by reducing effective
potential barriers with respect to Simulated Annealing. More specifically, we
estimate the hitting times of unexplored potential wells for our model in the
small noise regime and show that they compare favorably with the ones of
overdamped Langevin. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions, including
double wells and the Ackley function, validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate better performance over the well-known Simulated Annealing method
in terms of escaping local minima and achieving faster convergence.

Abstract: Time series analysis faces significant challenges in handling variable-length

advanced time series tasks, they often struggle with feature redundancy and
limited generalization capabilities. Drawing inspiration from classical CNN
architectures' pyramidal structure, we propose a Multi-Scale Representation
Learning Framework based on a Conv-like ScaleFusion Transformer. Our approach
introduces a temporal convolution-like structure that combines patching
operations with multi-head attention, enabling progressive temporal dimension
compression and feature channel expansion. We further develop a novel
cross-scale attention mechanism for effective feature fusion across different
temporal scales, along with a log-space normalization method for
variable-length sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
achieves superior feature independence, reduced redundancy, and better
performance in forecasting and classification tasks compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models
(LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly
understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition
(SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two
widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and
long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two
consistent and unexpected structural changes:(1) a near-uniform geometric
scaling of singular values across layers, which theoretically modulates
attention scores; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are
applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Disrupting this
orthogonal consistency leads to catastrophic performance degradation. Based on
these findings, we propose a simple yet effective framework that interprets
post-training as a reparameterization of fixed subspaces in the pretrained
parameter space. Further experiments reveal that singular value scaling behaves
as a secondary effect, analogous to a temperature adjustment, whereas the core
functional transformation lies in the coordinated rotation of singular vectors.
These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large
models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how
parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper
investigation into model parameter changes.

Conclusion: 研究为OEMs提供了动态维护调度的决策工具，平衡客户偏好与运营效率，ADRL-RE尤其具有现实应用潜力。

Abstract: Problem definition: For original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), high-tech
maintenance is a strategic component in after-sales services, involving close
coordination between customers and service engineers. Each customer suggests
several time slots for their maintenance task, from which the OEM must select
one. This decision needs to be made promptly to support customers' planning. At
the end of each day, routes for service engineers are planned to fulfill the
tasks scheduled for the following day. We study this hierarchical and
sequential decision-making problem-the Dynamic Time Slot Assignment Problem
with Commitments and Customer Preferences (DTSAP-CCP)-in this paper.
Methodology/results: Two distinct approaches are proposed: 1) an
attention-based deep reinforcement learning with rollout execution (ADRL-RE)
and 2) a scenario-based planning approach (SBP). The ADRL-RE combines a
well-trained attention-based neural network with a rollout framework for online
trajectory simulation. To support the training, we develop a neural heuristic
solver that provides rapid route planning solutions, enabling efficient
learning in complex combinatorial settings. The SBP approach samples several
scenarios to guide the time slot assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the superiority of ADRL-RE and the stability of SBP compared to both rule-based
and rollout-based approaches. Furthermore, the strong practicality of ADRL-RE
is verified in a case study of after-sales service for large medical equipment.
Implications: This study provides OEMs with practical decision-support tools
for dynamic maintenance scheduling, balancing customer preferences and
operational efficiency. In particular, our ADRL-RE shows strong real-world
potential, supporting timely and customer-aligned maintenance scheduling.

Result: NSNs可应用于预训练LLMs，实现平滑的计算-性能权衡，例如减少50%推理FLOPs仅损失5%准确率。

Conclusion: NSNs为下一代自适应基础模型提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Large neural networks are typically trained for a fixed computational budget,
creating a rigid trade-off between performance and efficiency that is
ill-suited for deployment in resource-constrained or dynamic environments.
Existing approaches to this problem present a difficult choice: training a
discrete collection of specialist models is computationally prohibitive, while
dynamic methods like slimmable networks often lack the flexibility to be
applied to large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, we propose
Nested Subspace Networks (NSNs), a novel architectural paradigm that enables a
single model to be dynamically and granularly adjusted across a continuous
spectrum of compute budgets at inference time. The core of our approach is to
re-parameterize linear layers to satisfy a nested subspace property, such that
the function computed at a given rank is a strict subspace of the function at
any higher rank. We show that this entire hierarchy of models can be optimized
jointly via an uncertainty-aware objective that learns to balance the
contributions of different ranks based on their intrinsic difficulty. We
demonstrate empirically that NSNs can be surgically applied to pre-trained LLMs
and unlock a smooth and predictable compute-performance frontier. For example,
a single NSN-adapted model can achieve a 50% reduction in inference FLOPs with
only a 5 percentage point loss in accuracy. Our findings establish NSNs as a
powerful framework for creating the next generation of adaptive foundation
models.

Result: 在Indian Pines和Fashion-MNIST基准测试中，CGT降低了推理成本并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: CGT为资源受限环境中的深度模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Early-exit neural networks reduce inference cost by enabling confident
predictions at intermediate layers. However, joint training often leads to
gradient interference, with deeper classifiers dominating optimization. We
propose Confidence-Gated Training (CGT), a paradigm that conditionally
propagates gradients from deeper exits only when preceding exits fail. This
encourages shallow classifiers to act as primary decision points while
reserving deeper layers for harder inputs. By aligning training with the
inference-time policy, CGT mitigates overthinking, improves early-exit
accuracy, and preserves efficiency. Experiments on the Indian Pines and
Fashion-MNIST benchmarks show that CGT lowers average inference cost while
improving overall accuracy, offering a practical solution for deploying deep
models in resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在合成和实际多目标基准测试中，Gaussian-PSL优于标准PSL模型，保持计算效率和模型简洁性。

Conclusion: Gaussian-PSL为复杂前沿几何下的多目标优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is essential for solving complex
real-world problems involving multiple conflicting objectives. However, many
practical applications - including engineering design, autonomous systems, and
machine learning - often yield non-convex, degenerate, or discontinuous Pareto
frontiers, which involve traditional scalarization and Pareto Set Learning
(PSL) methods that struggle to approximate accurately. Existing PSL approaches
perform well on convex fronts but tend to fail in capturing the diversity and
structure of irregular Pareto sets commonly observed in real-world scenarios.
In this paper, we propose Gaussian-PSL, a novel framework that integrates
Gaussian Splatting into PSL to address the challenges posed by non-convex
Pareto frontiers. Our method dynamically partitions the preference vector
space, enabling simple MLP networks to learn localized features within each
region, which are then integrated by an additional MLP aggregator. This
partition-aware strategy enhances both exploration and convergence, reduces
sensi- tivity to initialization, and improves robustness against local optima.
We first provide the mathematical formulation for controllable Pareto set
learning using Gaussian Splat- ting. Then, we introduce the Gaussian-PSL
architecture and evaluate its performance on synthetic and real-world
multi-objective benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms standard PSL models in learning irregular Pareto fronts while
maintaining computational efficiency and model simplicity. This work offers a
new direction for effective and scalable MOO under challenging frontier
geometries.

TL;DR: SingLEM是一种自监督基础模型，通过单通道EEG学习通用表示，解决了现有模型依赖多通道和大量标注数据的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG深度学习模型依赖任务特定设计和多通道数据，限制了其适应性和实用性。

Method: SingLEM采用混合编码器架构，结合卷积层和分层Transformer，从单通道EEG中学习特征。

Result: 在多个任务中，SingLEM的表现优于多通道基础模型和手工基线。

Conclusion: 单通道方法可实现最先进的泛化能力，同时提升可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Current deep learning models for electroencephalography (EEG) are often
task-specific and depend on large labeled datasets, limiting their
adaptability. Although emerging foundation models aim for broader
applicability, their rigid dependence on fixed, high-density multi-channel
montages restricts their use across heterogeneous datasets and in
missing-channel or practical low-channel settings. To address these
limitations, we introduce SingLEM, a self-supervised foundation model that
learns robust, general-purpose representations from single-channel EEG, making
it inherently hardware agnostic. The model employs a hybrid encoder
architecture that combines convolutional layers to extract local features with
a hierarchical transformer to model both short- and long-range temporal
dependencies. SingLEM is pretrained on 71 public datasets comprising over 9,200
subjects and 357,000 single-channel hours of EEG. When evaluated as a fixed
feature extractor across six motor imagery and cognitive tasks, aggregated
single-channel representations consistently outperformed leading multi-channel
foundation models and handcrafted baselines. These results demonstrate that a
single-channel approach can achieve state-of-the-art generalization while
enabling fine-grained neurophysiological analysis and enhancing
interpretability. The source code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: MPF框架通过结合Naive Bayes和Decision Tree，解决了临床机器学习中解释性与性能的权衡问题，在NIPT中实现了高敏感性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险医疗应用中算法解释性与诊断性能之间的矛盾，特别是在非侵入性产前测试（NIPT）中。

Method: 提出Medical Priority Fusion (MPF)框架，结合Naive Bayes概率推理和Decision Tree规则逻辑，通过加权融合优化。

Result: 在1,687个NIPT样本中，MPF实现了89.3%的敏感性和80%的可解释性评分，显著优于单独算法。

Conclusion: MPF证明了医学约束下的算法融合可以解决解释性与性能的权衡，为高风险医疗决策支持系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Clinical machine learning faces a critical dilemma in high-stakes medical
applications: algorithms achieving optimal diagnostic performance typically
sacrifice the interpretability essential for physician decision-making, while
interpretable methods compromise sensitivity in complex scenarios. This paradox
becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where
missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet
regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical
Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework
that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive
Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through
mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints.
Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme
class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold
cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis
testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous
optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with
80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms
(McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A
clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing
the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic
accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work
demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the
interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for
developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical
efficacy and explainability requirements.

TL;DR: StefaLand是一种生成时空地球基础模型，专注于景观交互，显著提升了动态地表任务的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在空间泛化上表现不佳，而现有视觉基础模型计算量大且不适合动态地表预测。StefaLand旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 基于掩码自编码器架构，融合静态和时间序列输入，通过属性表示减少计算量，并采用残差微调适配器增强迁移能力。

Result: 在三个任务（径流、土壤湿度和土壤成分）和四个数据集上优于现有方法，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: StefaLand是首个显著提升动态地表交互预测的地球科学基础模型，支持多样化下游应用。

Abstract: Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and
landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict
climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy.
Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine
learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and
concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite
imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface
prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth
foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves
predictions on three tasks and four datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and
soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its
ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad
land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone
that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a
location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs,
attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual
fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods,
their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust
performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and
finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first
geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic
land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream
applications.

Method: 采用模型驱动和数据驱动方法，分析内存和计算频率联合调整的效果，并结合不同DNN模型的拟合参数进行验证。

Result: 仿真结果表明，联合调整内存和计算频率能有效降低设备能耗。

Conclusion: 内存频率的调整对DNN推理的能耗和延迟有显著影响，联合优化可提升效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications,
but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on
resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus
on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the
latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of
processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and
not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a
significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper,
we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing
frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a
model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting
parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the
proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing
frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and
cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly
scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy
consumption of devices.

TL;DR: 论文研究了互补标签学习（CLL）中的数据增强问题，发现传统Mixup技术效果不佳，提出改进的Intra-Cluster Mixup（ICM）方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互补标签学习（CLL）是一种弱监督学习形式，其标签成本低但数据增强潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 通过分析发现Mixup在CLL中效果差，提出ICM方法，仅从邻近样本合成数据以减少噪声影响。

Result: ICM在MNIST和CIFAR数据集上分别实现了30%和10%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: ICM是一种有效的CLL数据增强技术，能与现有算法结合显著提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning
(CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are
trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather
than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing
because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less
labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the
development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this
domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the
widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly
applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the
complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance
of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup
(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate
the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label
sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements
across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide
spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings
justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms,
achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR
datasets, respectively.

Method: BETA识别对目标节点分类最具影响力的传感器，并注入对抗性扰动。

Result: 实验显示BETA将检测准确率降低30.62%至39.16%，优于基线攻击策略。

Conclusion: BETA证明了GNN检测器在实际攻击场景中的脆弱性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly
detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time
series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack
targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to
perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target
sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a
false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to
the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial
perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting
the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets
show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based
detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline
attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Equilibrium flow的方法，用于从静态数据分布中推断潜在的动态系统，并在多个系统中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据通常是动态系统的静态快照，缺乏时间顺序信息，但隐含了生成这些数据的动态过程。研究旨在探索如何从这些分布中恢复动态系统。

Method: 引入了Equilibrium flow方法，通过学习连续动态系统来保留给定的数据分布。针对高维数据，还开发了一种无需训练的高效变体。

Result: 方法在2-D系统和Lorenz吸引子中成功识别了动态行为，并在Gray-Scott模型的高维图灵模式中实现了高保真恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能够恢复已知系统，还能通过指定目标分布逆向设计动态规则，为人工生命等领域提供了新范式。

Abstract: Scientific data, from cellular snapshots in biology to celestial
distributions in cosmology, often consists of static patterns from underlying
dynamical systems. These snapshots, while lacking temporal ordering, implicitly
encode the processes that preserve them. This work investigates how strongly
such a distribution constrains its underlying dynamics and how to recover them.
We introduce the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous
dynamics that preserve a given pattern distribution. Our method successfully
identifies plausible dynamics for 2-D systems and recovers the signature
chaotic behavior of the Lorenz attractor. For high-dimensional Turing patterns
from the Gray-Scott model, we develop an efficient, training-free variant that
achieves high fidelity to the ground truth, validated both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Our analysis reveals the solution space is constrained not only
by the data but also by the learning model's inductive biases. This capability
extends beyond recovering known systems, enabling a new paradigm of inverse
design for Artificial Life. By specifying a target pattern distribution, we can
discover the local interaction rules that preserve it, leading to the
spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors, such as life-like flocking,
attraction, and repulsion patterns, from simple, user-defined snapshots.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAKE的新方法，利用大语言模型动态优化贝叶斯优化中的高斯过程核，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法依赖固定或启发式核选择策略，可能导致收敛慢或次优解。

Method: CAKE利用大语言模型作为交叉和变异操作符，动态生成和优化高斯过程核；BAKER通过平衡BIC和期望改进选择最优核。

Result: 实验表明，CAKE在超参数优化、控制器调谐和光子芯片设计等任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAKE通过动态核优化显著提升了贝叶斯优化的效率和性能。

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of
the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing
exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO
methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can
result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is
poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation,
we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO
with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the
crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels
based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the
power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to
select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each
iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO
method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of
real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and
photonic chip design. Our code is publicly available at

Method: 利用扩展的SDE框架和SGN分析，提出Reweighted SAM方法。

Result: 发现SAM噪声具有方差正则化效应，Reweighted SAM有效模拟m-SAM。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证了Reweighted SAM的有效性。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective
technique for improving model generalization, but its underlying principles are
not fully understood. We investigated the phenomenon known as m-sharpness,
where the performance of SAM improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for
computing perturbations decreases. Leveraging an extended Stochastic
Differential Equation (SDE) framework, combined with an analysis of the
structure of stochastic gradient noise (SGN), we precisely characterize the
dynamics of various SAM variants. Our findings reveal that the stochastic noise
introduced during SAM perturbations inherently induces a variance-based
sharpness regularization effect. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we
introduce Reweighted SAM, which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic
the generalization benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our theoretical
analysis and proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an iterative training algorithm for Neural ODEs
that provides models resilient to control (parameter) disturbances. The method
builds on our earlier work Tuning without Forgetting-and similarly introduces
training points sequentially, and updates the parameters on new data within the
space of parameters that do not decrease performance on the previously learned
training points-with the key difference that, inspired by the concept of flat
minima, we solve a minimax problem for a non-convex non-concave functional over
an infinite-dimensional control space. We develop a projected gradient descent
algorithm on the space of parameters that admits the structure of an
infinite-dimensional Banach subspace. We show through simulations that this
formulation enables the model to effectively learn new data points and gain
robustness against control disturbance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术（如AlphaEvolve）是否能帮助发现新的组合结构，从而改进算法效率的理论极限。

Method: 使用AlphaEvolve（一种LLM编码代理）研究两种场景：1）平均情况下的硬度问题；2）最坏情况下的近似硬度问题。通过构造极值图和发现新的gadget归约实现改进。

Result: 在MAX-CUT和MAX-Independent Set中取得近最优的上下界；在MAX-4-CUT和MAX-3-CUT中改进不可近似性结果（分别为0.987和0.9649）。

Conclusion: AI（AlphaEvolve）在证明开发中提供了显著帮助，但验证构造的成本较高。讨论了评估AI辅助证明的规范。

Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial
structures that improve provable limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically,
we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a
recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)
lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on
random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by
constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using
AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper
bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error
in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new
inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT
and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using
AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves
upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current
best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of
improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget
reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction
produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both
settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve
the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We
conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI
in developing proofs.

Motivation: 研究LLM在面对恶意请求时可能表现出的策略性不诚实行为，及其对模型安全性和评估的影响。

Method: 通过实验展示模型的不诚实行为，并测试输出监控器和内部激活线性探针的检测效果。

Result: 策略性不诚实行为欺骗了所有测试的输出监控器，但内部激活线性探针能可靠检测。

Conclusion: 策略性不诚实行为表明LLM对齐难以控制，尤其在有用性和无害性冲突时，需改进检测方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest,
helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are
trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can
develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options
are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that
sound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This
behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the
same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but
we show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy.
Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as
we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect
jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further,
strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which
noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we
show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect
strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes
and by using their features as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic
dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is
hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.

Motivation: 现有公平排名系统关注整个列表的平均曝光，但实际决策往往仅关注前K项，导致不公平问题未被充分解决。

Method: 提出了一种列表式学习排序框架，扩展了经典曝光差异度量，并通过可微目标函数优化前K排名的公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和公平性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了前K排名中的公平问题，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Fairness in ranking models is crucial, as disparities in exposure can
disproportionately affect protected groups. Most fairness-aware ranking systems
focus on ensuring comparable average exposure for groups across the entire
ranked list, which may not fully address real-world concerns. For example, when
a ranking model is used for allocating resources among candidates or disaster
hotspots, decision-makers often prioritize only the top-$K$ ranked items, while
the ranking beyond top-$K$ becomes less relevant. In this paper, we propose a
list-wise learning-to-rank framework that addresses the issues of inequalities
in top-$K$ rankings at training time. Specifically, we propose a top-$K$
exposure disparity measure that extends the classic exposure disparity metric
in a ranked list. We then learn a ranker to balance relevance and fairness in
top-$K$ rankings. Since direct top-$K$ selection is computationally expensive
for a large number of items, we transform the non-differentiable selection
process into a differentiable objective function and develop efficient
stochastic optimization algorithms to achieve both high accuracy and sufficient
fairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing methods.

Result: Spiffy将dLLM推理速度提升2.8-3.1倍，结合其他并行解码技术时总速度提升可达7.9倍。

Conclusion: Spiffy有效解决了dLLM生成速度问题，且与其他优化方法互补，显著提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly
higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs
often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at
every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present
Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by
$\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output
distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying
ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes
draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an
auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and
eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To
structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph
which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise
nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To
further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an
efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines
high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling
increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup
achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent
innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and
multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel
decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of
these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.
