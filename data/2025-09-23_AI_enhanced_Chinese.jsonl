Unlike state-based RL,\nvision-based RL is much more memory inefficient, resulting in relatively low\nbatch sizes, which is not amenable for algorithms like PPO. Nevertheless, it is\nstill an attractive method as unlike the more commonly used techniques which\ndistill state-based policies into vision networks, end-to-end RL can allow for\nemergent active vision behaviors. We identify a key bottleneck in training\nthese policies is the way most existing simulators scale to multiple GPUs using\ntraditional data parallelism techniques. We propose a new method where we\ndisaggregate the simulator and RL (both training and experience buffers) onto\nseparate GPUs. On a node with four GPUs, we have the simulator running on three\nof them, and PPO running on the fourth. We are able to show that with the same\nnumber of GPUs, we can double the number of existing environments compared to\nthe previous baseline of standard data parallelism. This allows us to train\nvision-based environments, end-to-end with depth, which were previously\nperforming far worse with the baseline. We train and distill both depth and\nstate-based policies into stereo RGB networks and show that depth distillation\nleads to better results, both in simulation and reality.

Anticipating the effects of wildfire,\ndrought, disease, or atmospheric deposition depends on accurate\ncharacterization of 3D vegetation structure, yet widespread measurement remains\nprohibitively expensive and often infeasible. We introduce ForestGen3D, a novel\ngenerative modeling framework that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D forest\nstructure using only aerial LiDAR (ALS) inputs. ForestGen3D is based on\nconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) trained on\nco-registered ALS/TLS (terrestrial LiDAR) data. The model learns to generate\nTLS-like 3D point clouds conditioned on sparse ALS observations, effectively\nreconstructing occluded sub-canopy detail at scale.

Prior studies have shown\nthat thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images\ninto different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer\nclassification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)\nis the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound\nimages are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple\ncomplex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence,\nwe second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local\nDCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context.\nAnother disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering\nof ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third\nconjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the\ntextural features and propose the integration of another popular texture\ncapturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is\nknown to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary\nPattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification\nis carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on\nthe only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD.\nThe evaluation is conducted in two stages. In Stage I, thyroid nodules are\ncategorized as benign or malignant. In Stage II, the malignant cases are\nfurther sub-classified into TI-RADS (4) and TI-RADS (5). For Stage I\nclassification, our proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance of\nnearly 100% on TDID and 97% on AUITD.

Specially, the generated pseudo-point clouds\nretain geometric and topological structures so we design a pseudo-point cloud\nencoder to preserve these properties, making it well-suited for our framework.\nWe also investigate the effectiveness of different feature fusion\nstrategies.Our framework enhances the robot's understanding of 3D spatial\nstructures while completely eliminating the substantial costs associated with\n3D point cloud acquisition.Extensive experiments across various tasks validate\nthat our framework can achieve performance comparable to 3D point cloud-based\nmethods, without the actual point cloud data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNoReal3D\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73DStructureFormer\u5c06\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4f2a\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283DStructureFormer\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e2D\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4f2a\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd13D\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "NoReal3D\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, traditional approaches often rely on\nprogramming tailored to each product by experts for fixed settings, which are\ninherently inflexible to product changes and lack the robustness to handle\nvariations. As Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robotics for their\nmodularity and reactivity, we propose a novel hierarchical framework,\nVideo-to-BT, that seamlessly integrates high-level cognitive planning with\nlow-level reactive control, with BTs serving both as the structured output of\nplanning and as the governing structure for execution. Our approach leverages a\nVision-Language Model (VLM) to decompose human demonstration videos into\nsubtasks, from which Behavior Trees are generated. During the execution, the\nplanned BTs combined with real-time scene interpretation enable the system to\noperate reactively in the dynamic environment, while VLM-driven replanning is\ntriggered upon execution failure. This closed-loop architecture ensures\nstability and adaptivity. We validate our framework on real-world assembly\ntasks through a series of experiments, demonstrating high planning reliability,\nrobust performance in long-horizon assembly tasks, and strong generalization\nacross diverse and perturbed conditions.

However, redundancy in vision tokens\nresults in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs, which hinders\nreal-time use on edge consumer devices such as AR/VR devices. Existing\nefficiency methods commonly prune visual tokens using learned saliency, sparse\nattention schedules, or controller policies, but they often require\narchitectural modification or access to intermediate activations. These\npipelines add inference-time modules that increase compute and memory and often\nlead to an accuracy trade-off. Moreover, they also suffer from misalignment\nbetween the prompts and the region of interest in the images. Without human\nguidance, the model may focus on the wrong regions and miss small,\nhigh-frequency details when prompts or scenes change. In this paper, we propose\nGazeVLM, a training-free framework that uses the human eye gaze as a natural\nsupervisory signal to allocate computation where it matters. By extracting\ngaze-driven regions of interest (ROIs) and optionally combining them with a\nlow-resolution global view, GazeVLM mimics fovea-periphery perception to cut\nredundant visual tokens while preserving task-relevant details.

These policies are conditioned on several observational\nmodalities such as proprioception, vision and tactile.

To\nmake this concrete, we study length generalization, the ability to generate\nimages with more objects than seen during training. In a controlled CLEVR\nsetting (Johnson et al., 2017), we find that length generalization is\nachievable in some cases but not others, suggesting that models only sometimes\nlearn the underlying compositional structure. We then investigate locality as a\nstructural mechanism for compositional generalization. Prior works proposed\nscore locality as a mechanism for creativity in unconditional diffusion models\n(Kamb & Ganguli, 2024; Niedoba et al., 2024), but did not address flexible\nconditioning or compositional generalization. In this paper, we prove an exact\nequivalence between a specific compositional structure (\"conditional projective\ncomposition\") (Bradley et al., 2025) and scores with sparse dependencies on\nboth pixels and conditioners (\"local conditional scores\"). This theory also\nextends to feature-space compositionality.

To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we\ndevelop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and\ngeneration in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent\nSemantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree\ngraph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient\noccupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i)\nstructure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse\noccupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic\nembeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform\nsemantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time\nlatent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods\nuse partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for\nretraining or finetuning.

It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection:\ngiven an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice\nButton, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering\nCommon Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million\ndocuments, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of\nroughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the\ndataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the\npages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up\nmore than 25% of the dataset.\n  In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors,\nFFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on\nthe CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation\nresults show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form\nfield detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over\nusing all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative\nanalysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF\nreader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available\nsolutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature\nfields.

With high\noperating speeds, dynamic environments, and head-to-head interactions,\nautonomous racing requires algorithms that diverge from those in classical\nautonomous driving. Training such algorithms is particularly challenging: the\nneed for rapid decision-making at high speeds severely limits model capacity.\nTo address this, we propose End2Race, a novel end-to-end imitation learning\nalgorithm designed for head-to-head autonomous racing. End2Race leverages a\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture to capture continuous temporal\ndependencies, enabling both short-term responsiveness and long-term strategic\nplanning.

The algorithm is extremely efficient, achieving an\ninference time of less than 0.5 milliseconds on a consumer-class GPU.\nExperiments in the F1Tenth simulator demonstrate that End2Race achieves a 94.2%\nsafety rate across 2,400 overtaking scenarios, each with an 8-second time\nlimit, and successfully completes overtakes in 59.2% of cases.

Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance\nshrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical\nmanifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from\ngeneralization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where\nmodels increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content\nduring iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly\ndriven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each\ntraining cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation.\nMotivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy\nto mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate\nmodel collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances\nvisual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing\ncollapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cfAI\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u7f29\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5d29\u6e83\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u71b5\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u71b5\u4e0b\u964d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u71b5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002"}}

However, these datasets frequently fall short of\nproviding cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this\npaper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural\nreasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich\nimages in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with\nmultiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the\nrelevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the\nfirst stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating\nfrom the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group.\nNotably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type.\nProgression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is\nchosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural\nartifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose\ndiverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which\n1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation\nof various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural\nreasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial\ngrounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial\nbenchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future\ndevelopments in the field of cultural reasoning.\nhttps://github.com/buraksatar/SeeingCulture", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u4e30\u5bcc\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cSCB\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u6587\u5316\u3002", "method": "SCB\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a1) \u591a\u9009\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u89c6\u89c9\u9009\u9879\uff1b2) \u5206\u5272\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u5316\u6587\u7269\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u9009\u9879\u5206\u4e3a\u540c\u56fd\u3001\u5f02\u56fd\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "SCB\u5305\u542b1,065\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u30013,178\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff081,093\u4e2a\u552f\u4e00\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d67\u4e2a\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684138\u79cd\u6587\u5316\u6587\u7269\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCB\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6587\u5316\u7ec6\u5fae\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting\nsparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works\ntypically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only\nwhen all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and\nM keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of\nattention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and\nleaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse\nattention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages\nsparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips\nentire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1\nslices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products\nbetween a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed\nsparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation\ncalled asynchronous-gather load.

Traditional approaches to DfRA rely on manual planning, which is\ntime-consuming, expensive and potentially impractical for complex objects.\nLarge language models (LLM) have exhibited proficiency in semantic\ninterpretation and robotic task planning, stimulating interest in their\napplication to the automation of DfRA. But existing methodologies typically\nrely on heuristic strategies and rigid, hard-coded physics simulators that may\nnot translate into real-world assembly contexts. In this work, we present\nIterative Design for Robotic Assembly (IDfRA), a framework using iterative\ncycles of planning, execution, verification, and re-planning, each informed by\nself-assessment, to progressively enhance design quality within a fixed yet\ninitially under-specified environment, thereby eliminating the physics\nsimulation with the real world itself. The framework accepts as input a target\nstructure together with a partial environmental representation. Through\nsuccessive refinement, it converges toward solutions that reconcile semantic\nfidelity with physical feasibility. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nIDfRA attains 73.3\\% top-1 accuracy in semantic recognisability, surpassing the\nbaseline on this metric. Moreover, the resulting assembly plans exhibit robust\nphysical feasibility, achieving an overall 86.9\\% construction success rate,\nwith design quality improving across iterations, albeit not always\nmonotonically.

The robots need to optimize a common task-specific\nobjective, which, under the restricted setting, must be done using a\ncommunication policy that exhibits the desired collaborative behavior. The\nproposed MAST is a decentralized transformer architecture that learns\ncommunication policies to compute abstract information to be shared with other\nagents and processes the received information with the robot's own\nobservations. The MAST extends the standard transformer with new positional\nencoding strategies and attention operations that employ windowing to limit the\nreceptive field for MRS.

SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian\nrepresentations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging\nself-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the\nreconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the\npre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks\nvia query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries\nwith task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements\nof occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on\nautonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable\nperformance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in\noccupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior\nstate-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3\nmIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).", "AI": {"tldr": "SQS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08SPMs\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08SPMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6BEV\u6216\u4f53\u79ef\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "SQS\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSQS\u5728\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u548c3D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u53471.3 mIoU\uff0c3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u53471.0 NDS\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "SQS\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Series elastic actuators (SEAs) fundamentally advance\nsafety by introducing compliant actuation. On the one hand, adding a spring\nmitigates the impact of accidental collisions between human and robot; but on\nthe other hand, this spring introduces oscillations and fundamentally decreases\nthe robot's ability to perform precise, accurate motions. So how should we\ntrade off between physical safety and performance? In this paper, we enumerate\nthe different linear control and mechanical configurations for series elastic\nactuators, and explore how each choice affects the rendered compliance,\npassivity, and tracking performance. While prior works focus on load side\ncontrol, we find that actuator side control has significant benefits. Indeed,\nsimple PD controllers on the actuator side allow for a much wider range of\ncontrol gains that maintain safety, and combining these with a damper in the\nelastic transmission yields high performance.

Inference scales\nlinearly in planes and features, making GMC CPU-friendly, with single-digit\nmicrosecond latency per example, often faster than RBF-SVM and compact MLPs.\nPost-hoc temperature scaling reduces ECE from about 0.06 to 0.02.

The main\nchallenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait,\naccurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal\nconsistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity\npreservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion\nwith two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion\nsignals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and\nreduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both\nexpression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully\npreserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports\ncontrollable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including\nreal faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based\nframeworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable\nanimation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address\nthis, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term\nanimation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless\nacceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality\nresults efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible.

Through\nextensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g.,\nGPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some\ntemporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in\nvector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source\nVLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that\nspatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also\nfind that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size,\nlength of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction\nfor future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u9053\u8def\u62d3\u6251\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9053\u8def\u62d3\u6251\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5730\u9762\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff08BEV\uff09\u8f66\u9053\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bca\u65adVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4o\uff09\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff08\u5982\u4ec567.8%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90VLMs\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

We\nargue that there are two essential properties of any multicalibration error\nmetric: 1) the metric should capture how much $f$ would need to be modified in\norder to be perfectly multicalibrated; and 2) the metric should be auditable in\nan information theoretic sense. We show that wdMC and dMC each fail to satisfy\none of these two properties, and that similar barriers arise when considering\nthe auditability of general distance to multigroup fairness notions. We then\npropose two (equivalent) multicalibration metrics which do satisfy these\nrequirements: 1) a continuized variant of dMC; and 2) a distance to\nintersection multicalibration, which leans on intersectional fairness\ndesiderata. Along the way, we shed light on the loss-landscape of distance to\nmulticalibration and the geometry of the set of perfectly multicalibrated\npredictors. Our findings may have implications for the development of stronger\nmulticalibration algorithms as well as multigroup auditing more generally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u5316dMC\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Achieving such manipulation is\nchallenging because the high degrees of freedom tightly couple hand and arm\nmotions, making learning and control difficult. Successful dexterous\nmanipulation relies not only on precise hand motions, but also on accurate\nspatial positioning of the arm and coordinated arm-hand dynamics. However, most\nexisting visuomotor policies represent arm and hand actions in a single\ncombined space, which often causes high-dimensional hand actions to dominate\nthe coupled action space and compromise arm control. To address this, we\npropose DQ-RISE, which quantizes hand states to simplify hand motion prediction\nwhile preserving essential patterns, and applies a continuous relaxation that\nallows arm actions to diffuse jointly with these compact hand states.

In many robotic systems where\ndynamics are best modeled as stochastic systems due to factors such as sensing\nnoise and environmental disturbances, it is challenging for conventional\nmethods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to\nprovide a holistic measure of safety. We derive a linear operator governing the\ndynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its\ndominant eigenpair provides information about safety for both individual states\nand the overall closed-loop system.

The penetration of solar power challenges the grid\nstability and energy scheduling, due to its intermittent energy generation.\nAccurate and near real-time solar power prediction is of critical importance to\ntolerant and support the permeation of distributed and volatile solar power\nproduction in the energy system. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning\nbased ultra-short-term solar power prediction with data reconstruction. We\ndecompose the data for the prediction to facilitate extensive exploration of\nthe spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. Particularly, we\nreconstruct the data into low- and high-frequency components, using ensemble\nempirical model decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). We integrate\nmeteorological data with those two components, and employ deep-learning models\nto capture long- and short-term dependencies towards the target prediction\nperiod.

However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and\ncomplex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key\nimpediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture\nthe multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories\nthat deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose\nSocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social\npsychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing\nBayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we\nobtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To\nensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are\nembedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated\ntrajectories with historical driving styles.

Traditionally,\ninspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is\nto reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this\nformulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world\nenvironments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact\ncoordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and\ninefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the\ntarget's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the\ntarget becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a\nperception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning\nframework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary\nobjective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees\nvisual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy\nleverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in\nsimulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an\nalgorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a\nreference for evaluation.

A\nrecent work, SphereHead, attempted to address this issue by introducing\nspherical tri-planes based on a spherical coordinate system. While it\nsuccessfully mitigates feature entanglement, SphereHead suffers from uneven\nmapping between the square feature maps and the spherical planes, leading to\ninefficient feature map utilization during rendering and difficulties in\ngenerating fine image details. Moreover, both tri-plane and spherical tri-plane\nrepresentations share a subtle yet persistent issue: feature penetration across\nconvolutional channels can cause interference between planes, particularly when\none plane dominates the others.

Rehg"], "title": "DiffEye: Diffusion-Based Continuous Eye-Tracking Data Generation Conditioned on Natural Images", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction,\nwhich are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a\nsequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich\ninformation contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover,\nmost existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human\nsubjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of\nfixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and\nstochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model\ncontinuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural\nimages. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli\nand introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding\n(CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic\nfeatures of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories\nrather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in\nhuman gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement\npatterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated\ntrajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting\nin outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual\nattention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images\nusing a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking\ndata. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the\nfirst time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

The challenge lies in the\ncombinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can\ninclude multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification\ncombinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example,\n\"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists\nof two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of\nthe road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the\nintuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its\nconstituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive.\nUsing diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then\ncomposes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of\nspecifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for\ndemonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training\nprocedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for\ndynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the\nbase model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world\nexperiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions\nby generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of\nspecifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based\npolicies and costmap composing baselines.

In this paper,\nwe investigate both the presence and nature of selection bias in LVLMs through\nfine-grained MCQA benchmarks spanning easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels,\ndefined by the semantic similarity of the options. We further propose an\ninference-time logit-level debiasing method that estimates an ensemble bias\nvector from general and contextual prompts and applies confidence-adaptive\ncorrections to the model's output. Our method mitigates bias without retraining\nand is compatible with frozen LVLMs. Extensive experiments across several\nstate-of-the-art models reveal consistent selection biases that intensify with\ntask difficulty, and show that our mitigation approach significantly reduces\nbias while improving accuracy in challenging settings. This work offers new\ninsights into the limitations of LVLMs in MCQA and presents a practical\napproach to improve their robustness in fine-grained visual reasoning.

However, IL policies often struggle when faced with\nout-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a\npreviously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases,\nextensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and\ngeneralizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical\ninitial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task\nexecution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier\nto grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp\ntheir target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same\ncapability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their\ngiven policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which\nare outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses\nso that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we\nshow that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out\nthe given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET\nalgorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic\nteleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what\nsimplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into\nrobot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other\nbaselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust\ntask execution with equal amounts of total training data.

The key innovations include: (1) a nested\nthree-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume while enabling\nindependent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force\ntransmission and expand motion range, and (3) a central supporting ball\nfunctioning as a spherical joint that enhances structural stiffness without\ncompromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present comprehensive kinematic\nmodeling including forward / inverse kinematics and a numerical Jacobian\nsolution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates\nstrong performance in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative\nmanipulation tasks, outperforming Kinova-based systems. Results indicate\nsignificant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and stiffness compared to\ntraditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as a promising solution for\nnext-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ByteWrist\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7684\u5e76\u8054\u624b\u8155\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4e09\u7ea7\u5e76\u8054\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f27\u5f62\u672b\u7aef\u8fde\u6746\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u8155\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4e32\u8054\u548c\u5e76\u8054\u624b\u8155\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bb6\u5ead\u670d\u52a1\u3001\u533b\u7597\u8f85\u52a9\u548c\u7cbe\u5bc6\u7ec4\u88c5\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u4e09\u7ea7\u7535\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u8fde\u6746\u3001\u5f27\u5f62\u672b\u7aef\u8fde\u6746\u548c\u4e2d\u592e\u652f\u6491\u7403\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u521a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "ByteWrist\u662f\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent\nadvances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract\nmeaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are\noften missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of\npatients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations\ncan be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or\nradiology reports.

To achieve better performance on downstream\ntasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required\nto obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and\ntranscriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing\ncross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either\ngene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of\nessential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its\nquantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text\nalignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for\nlearning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked\nText-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names,\nand expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial\ntranscriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct\noccluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings.

Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only\nprovide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative\nrepresentations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of\nhigh-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis\nintegrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising\napproach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures\ndiscriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient\nintegration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary\ninformation fusion without losing critical information from individual\nmodalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to\nprocess unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba\narchitectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based\nscanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long\ninstance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information.\nSecond, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It\nexplicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities\nvia Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through\na global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy.

Recent methods use diffusion on either graph\nembeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges.

It\nis hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion\nsteps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We\nseparate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the\ntraining graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then\ngenerate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk\n\"trajectories\" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal\ngraph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly,\nwhich improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world\nbenchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods.

While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using\nmethods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a\nrecent work established $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS\nsolutions under smooth, non-convex losses.

While recent methods\nleverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they\ntypically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on\nlarge-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the\nmodel's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate,\nrequiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow\nauto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient,\nannotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves\nthis trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy\nattention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI\nlabels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these\nlabels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more\nprecise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in\na single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling\nRoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly\nmulti-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into\nthe LLaVA-1.5 architecture. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K)\nquestion-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and\ngeneralization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen\nbenchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star.

To overcome this, RPEP introduces a\nnovel generation strategy that decomposes hand movements into smaller,\nstep-by-step motions. This decomposition allows our method to capture temporal\nchanges in articulation, constructing more realistic event data for a moving\nhand. Additionally, RPEP imposes a motion reversal constraint, regularizing\nevent generation using reversed motion.

Models\nsuch as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic\nrenowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also\npotentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant\nconcerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these\nconcerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain\nunderexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for\ndiffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly\napplicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To\naddress this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a\nnovel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair\nconstruction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their\nassociated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training\napproach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual\ncontrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our\ncomprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure,\nexplicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method\neffectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing\nunsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts.

Existing approaches\nface several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of\nparameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still\ndepend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we\npropose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for\nbattery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.\nSeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the\nproposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging\nadaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit\nmodel (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together\nwith the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic\nbattery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves\nrobust performance.

However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard\nDA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques,\nor ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a\nmodel-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise.\nIn contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging\nthe model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,\nmodel-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to\nderive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a\nwell-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others\nholding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent\nagent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved\nindividual-level forecasts.

Volume electron microscopy (EM) offers the resolution required to\ncapture synaptic architecture, but automated detection remains difficult due to\nsparse annotations, morphological variability, and cross-dataset domain shifts.\nTo address this, we make three key contributions. First, we curate a diverse EM\nbenchmark spanning four datasets across two invertebrate species: adult and\nlarval Drosophila melanogaster, and Megaphragma viggianii (micro-WASP). Second,\nwe propose SimpSyn, a single-stage Residual U-Net trained to predict\ndual-channel spherical masks around pre- and post-synaptic sites, designed to\nprioritize training and inference speeds and annotation efficiency over\narchitectural complexity. Third, we benchmark SimpSyn against Buhmann et al.'s\nSynful [1], a state-of-the-art multi-task model that jointly infers synaptic\npairs. Despite its simplicity, SimpSyn consistently outperforms Synful in\nF1-score across all volumes for synaptic site detection. While generalization\nacross datasets remains limited, SimpSyn achieves competitive performance when\ntrained on the combined cohort. Finally, ablations reveal that simple\npost-processing strategies - such as local peak detection and distance-based\nfiltering - yield strong performance without complex test-time heuristics.\nTaken together, our results suggest that lightweight models, when aligned with\ntask structure, offer a practical and scalable solution for synapse detection\nin large-scale connectomic pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578bSimpSyn\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a81\u89e6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a81\u89e6\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSimpSyn\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6b8b\u5deeU-Net\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7403\u5f62\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a81\u89e6\u3002", "result": "SimpSyn\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSynful\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents.

In parallel, flatness of the loss\nlandscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet,\nthe causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites\nfor generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle\nthese questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization\nprecedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from\ntraining dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative\nflatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently\npredicts it.

However, 3DGS suffers from\nsignificant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to\nmodel view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose\ncompressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture\nhigh-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded\nreconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a\nnovel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians\nand neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit\nGaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based\nneural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational\ncapacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately\nmodeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color.\nAdditionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian\nsplatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in\ndistant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times\ncompared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets\nshow that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based\ndetectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline\nattack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "BETA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7070\u76d2\u89c4\u907f\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u9650\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u653b\u51fbGNN\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "BETA\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aBETA\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e30.62%\u81f339.16%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "BETA\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GNN\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

However, currently available open-source dLLMs\noften generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at\nevery denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present\nSpiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by\n$\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output\ndistribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking.

Previous UniDA methods primarily\nfocused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities\ndue to content differences, which limited their robustness and\ngeneralizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that\nleverages the strong \\textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language\nfoundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space\nalignment to enhance adaptation stability.

However, methods for generating these models suffer\nfrom critical limitations: excessive training costs introduced by direct\ntraining methods, or unavoidably hardware-unfriendly operations in existing\nconversion methods. In this paper, we propose CSDformer, a novel conversion\nmethod for fully spike-driven transformers. We tailor a conversion-oriented\ntransformer-based architecture and propose a new function NReLU to replace\nsoftmax in self-attention. Subsequently, this model is quantized and trained,\nand converted into a fully spike-driven model with temporal decomposition\ntechnique. Also, we propose delayed Integrate-andFire neurons to reduce\nconversion errors and improve the performance of spiking models. We evaluate\nCSDformer on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and achieve 76.36% top-1\naccuracy under 7 time-steps on ImageNet, demonstrating superiority over\nstate-of-the-art models. Furthermore, CSDformer eliminates the need for\ntraining SNNs, thereby reducing training costs (reducing computational resource\nby 75% and accelerating training speed by 2-3$\\times$).

Methods: Gait data from 18 subjects were recorded\nsimultaneously using frontal, lateral and 3D motion capture systems. Pose\nestimation used YOLOv8. Four metrics were assessed to evaluate agreement:\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal alignment, Maximum Cross-Correlation\n(MCC) for signal similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for distribution\ndifferences, and Information Entropy (IE) for complexity.

We present a latent diffusion model that\ngenerates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel\ndual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with\ntissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts\nor abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological\ndetails by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic\nregions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches\nensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity.

When evaluated on annotated datasets, models\ntrained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on\nreal data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue\ngeneration.

Most existing methods rely on\nsegmentation-based models that assume clear semantic boundaries of roofs, but\nthese approaches struggle in off- nadir images, where the roof and footprint\nare significantly displaced, and facade pixels are fused with the roof\nboundary. With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations,\ne.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation\nhas become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once\ncaptured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant\npositional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or\nfootprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building. To\naddress these discrepancies, we first introduce a concept of an alignment\ntoken, which encodes the correction vector to guide the label correction.

While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in\nthose settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos\ninvolving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches,\nwhich sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur\nsignificant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model\noften misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key\ntemporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these\nlimitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling,\nhierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However,\nthese methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal\nrepresentations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a\nresult, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually\nencodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address\nthese foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play\nneuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language\nquestion into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton\nfrom frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to\nrigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical\nrequirements.

We reveal that existing\nreinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with\nlarge temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and\nlimited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate\nsolutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth\nannotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,\neffectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy\nsolutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based\nupdates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method\nthat dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.\nBy employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1\noptimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference\nmodes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning\ncomplexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms\nGRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions\n(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%).

Conversely, less\nattention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding\ncapabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment\nbetween visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have\napplied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring\nexpression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either\nreferring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these\nfine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly\ncomprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our\nmodel distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception\nwith general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel\nprocesses visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs\nsubsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during\ninference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The\neffectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a\ndiverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and\nobject-centric understanding in images/videos.
