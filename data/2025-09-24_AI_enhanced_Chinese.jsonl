In this paper we show that it is possible to use an\nimage-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of\nprime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted\nfrom regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on\nblocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This\nimplies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in\nthe latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem\nto imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in\ndifferent regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at\nlower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns\nwith number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we\nshould see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages\n(density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness\nregularises after scaling by log x.

These policies provide\na strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should\nmanipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's\nneeds, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing\nthe robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the\nprocess of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences,\nhabits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can\nsimply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained\nbehaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots\nthat personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents?\nWe here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop\nPRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies.\nOur core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to\nmathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct\nkey, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with\nincorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the\ngeneral applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation\nlearning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks.

To avoid leakage, we perform\ngrouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation.\nAcross five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing;\nN=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest\nwith SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall\n92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches\none-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897.

Much of the\nexisting work in nonprehensile manipulation relies on parallel-jaw grippers or\ntools such as rods and spatulas. In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands\noffer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to\nprovide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty\nof modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose\nGeometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile\nmanipulation with dexterous robotic hands. We study pushing and pulling by\nframing the problem as synthesizing and learning pre-contact dexterous hand\nposes that lead to effective manipulation. We generate diverse hand poses via\ncontact-guided sampling, filter them using physics simulation, and train a\ndiffusion model conditioned on object geometry to predict viable poses.

Hence,\naccurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.\nFaults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied\nto the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage\npipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and\nactive FDI methods.

To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the\nshared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The\ndiscriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned\ninformation during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the\nshared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the\ndiscriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing\nknowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting\nself-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an\nindustrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for\ncontinual instruction tuning.

Preprint submitted to a CVF conference", "summary": "Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from\ncollections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many\nreal-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only\nthe test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by\nproposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the\ninductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior\n(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual\nloss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel\nfidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,\nand remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves\n0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the\nfabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic\nstrategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1\nmodulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment\nanalyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering\ninterpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted\nintervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are:\n(1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a\ngene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and\n(3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk\npopulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u901a\u8def\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bT2DM\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u9776\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u8c22\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982T2DM\uff09\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\uff08\u5982Pima\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u4eba\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548ct\u68c0\u9a8c\u5206\u6790Pima\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u8def\u6620\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\u5173\u8054\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a78.43%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001AMPK\u548cPPAR\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8c22\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a\nneural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,\ncontinuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing\nthe conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion\nmodeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the\nSpatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical\nrepresentation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by\nTransformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent\ndeformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers\ndemonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both\nregular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and\nbronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity.

Several approaches deploy\nan image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods\ncompress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform\nanalysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform\npoorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or\nlearn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a\nCodebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic\nEnhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete\nindices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and\nselectively transmits them to the cloud.

However, research on how\nto achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is\ninaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.\nSelf-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.\nMost existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more\nsupervisory information.

We identify\nthat these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an\nobject's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal\ninto (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we\nremove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly\nmask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong\ngeometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB\nimage conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are\nconsidered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide\nlearning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven\nobjective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to\nremove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new\nstructural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their\nassociated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

As a result, they\nfrequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive\nexpertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing\nknowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To\nfundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce\na novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among\nprofessional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large\nscale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from\nPhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a\nlanguageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image\naesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,\nPhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual\nunderstanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates\nclear advantages over existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PhotoCritique\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001PhotoEye\u6a21\u578b\u548cPhotoBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f8e\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f8e\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u5e08\u8ba8\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f8e\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a\nlarge-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises\nworldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural\nlanguage instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap\nbetween geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new\nevaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs\nexhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the\nstarting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face\nchallenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for\ntheir incorrect answers.

This challenge is particularly\ncritical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and\ndetailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has\nadvanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal\nspatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational\nOrientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese\nconversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing\negocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed\nscenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which\nintegrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a\nstructured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)\nmapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.\nA curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on\nTaiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of\nresource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%\norientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,\nsubstantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines.

Nevertheless, its\npoint clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone\napplication in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have\nprovided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt\nexplicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera\nfusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks.

To address these problems, we propose\nMLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via\nmulti-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the\npoint-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling\ncomprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:\nthe Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion\nPooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.\nOperating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image\ninstances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel\nFeature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D\nimage features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts\npooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image\nfeatures, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.\nExperimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets\ndemonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\nNotably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD\ndataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLF-4DRCNet\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u54084D\u96f7\u8fbe\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "4D\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u70b9\u4e91\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u57283D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMLF-4DRCNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u70b9\u7ea7\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u548c\u63d0\u6848\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u5305\u62ecERPE\uff08\u589e\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3001HSFP\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u878d\u5408\u6c60\u5316\uff09\u548cPLFE\uff08\u63d0\u6848\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728VoD\u548cTJ4DRadSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMLF-4DRCNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728VoD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1LiDAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MLF-4DRCNet\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u96f7\u8fbe\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u57283D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions.

To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and\nAdaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel\ncomponents: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture\nmulti-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive\nfusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable\ncross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nLEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in\nboth efficacy and efficiency.

Existing methods\nthat encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are\nunsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their\neffectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness.

Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency.

However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human\ndemonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the\ndiminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the\nenvironment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still,\ntraining RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to\nsample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from\nsparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL\nthrough a residual learning framework.

However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of\nthousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much\nless in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical\ncountries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have\nsystematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,\nespecially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity\ninformatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised\nrecords online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or \"PlantCLEF\n2021\") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of\nflora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It\nis based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana\nShield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant\ndiversities in the world.

While recent advances have achieved remarkable\nprogress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or\ncross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability.

Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a\nprominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic\napproach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection\nbetween PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its\nextensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in\na Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data\nmay be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than\nlying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal\nComponent Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction\nalgorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear\nmanifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition\nto the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be\nderived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold\nand noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA\nmodel parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data\ndistributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations\nand brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data\ndistribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.\nMoreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric\ncoordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one.

However, reconstructing 3D scenes\nfrom sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual\ninformation, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D\nrepresentation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to\ngenerative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in\nunder-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle\nto ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and\nimplausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method\nthat fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for\nsparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement.

Successive generations, including GPT-o\nseries, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale\nRL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model\nand rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits\nscalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are\ndiscarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that\nAPRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL\nalgorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%\nhigher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and\nhardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and\ndeployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike.

To circumvent\nthe prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs\nupcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its\nfeed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert\ndiversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This\npaper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using\nexperts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained\nmodels (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact\nthat these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter\nspace, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation.

We conducted a benchmarking study\nusing three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and\nWikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes.

Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph\nConstruction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack\nthe ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction\nmethod. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized\nGraph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies\nkey-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold\nreparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable\nmathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the\nneighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding\nmethods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows\ntuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds\nare learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the\nmodel.

Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts\nor one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning\nerror diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise\nreflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and\nthen proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,\nreflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.\nExperiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn\ntool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls.

While BSM has been\nsuccessfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state\nrepresentation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP\nscenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging.

However,\nits implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image\ndatasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive\nself-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective\ndue to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle\ndefect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we\nintroduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm\nthat explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP\nemploys a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by\ndistilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture\ndefect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect\nboxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable\nthis, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly\nmaps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.\nAdditionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface\ndefect datasets for validation.

However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers\nfrom a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either\nentirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these\nhomogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously\nincorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,\nleading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals.

These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters.

However, such energy advantage is often\nunrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and\nsubsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this\ncostly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural\nsignal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We\nfabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its\nnatural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By\ntreating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight\nand temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates\nthese expensive digital operations.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or\niterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal\ncoherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions\nwithout requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level\nclassification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically\nstudy synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing\nhow they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic\nand real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong\noffline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the\neffectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic\ndata as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking.

The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally\nhandle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture.\nExtensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation\nbenchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches\nstate-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying\nhomophily-heterophily characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "AxelGNN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bGNN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\u6982\u7387\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u590d\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfGNN\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGNN\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AxelGNN\u57fa\u4e8eAxelrod\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u590d\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAxelGNN\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AxelGNN\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GNN\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this\nknowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of\ntwo key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse\nweather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from\nclean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under\nadverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

However, these models often exhibit shallow language\nunderstanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are\nreinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.\nAdditionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training\nmakes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy\nconcerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the\nnecessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,\nsingle-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image\nretrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance\nof VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this\nparadigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of\nthe modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short\nand long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration\non two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions\nintroduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess\ngeneralisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality\nbenchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,\ncontaining diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin\nsubFlickr and subCOCO.

FedFiTS\nimplements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural\nselection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client\nscoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance\nconvergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis\nestablishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard\nassumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions\nrelative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical\nimaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular\nagricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently\noutperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and\nresilience to poisoning attacks.

However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily\nfocus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training\nprocess and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel\nregression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nLeveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),\nwhich characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training\nprocess for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical\nrelevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing\nthe loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model\nsizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters.

We overcome this challenge by\ndecoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level\ncontrol that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model\non a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning\nto map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion\nprior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give\nrise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars.

Recent advancements in video diffusion models have\nshown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the\napplications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with\nthe environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that\naims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an\nexplicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for\nmulti-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with\na 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this\napproach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated\nby video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D\nscenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our\nframework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input\nvideo.

Existing methods predominantly rely on a\npixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a\n3D Gaussian.

To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new\nmulti-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with\nvoxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D\nvoxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature\nmatching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables\nadaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding\nmore faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and\nenhanced novel-view rendering quality.

On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),\nequipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while\nintroducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAR-Flow\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u8d28\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAR-Flow\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u79fb\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f29\u77ed\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86CAR\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff08ImageNet-256\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cCAR-Flow\u5c06SiT-XL/2\u7684FID\u4ece2.07\u964d\u4f4e\u52301.68\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e0d\u52300.6%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "CAR-Flow\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}
