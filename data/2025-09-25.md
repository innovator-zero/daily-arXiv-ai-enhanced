### [1] [Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378)
*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非铺装道路和越野环境的感知系统，通过CMSNet框架实现实时语义分割，并发布了Kamino数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶在非均匀地形（如露天矿场和发展中国家道路）中的低延迟智能系统需求。

Method: 提出CMSNet框架，支持不同架构配置，并通过TensorRT、C++和CUDA优化实现实时推理。

Result: 在两种数据集上验证了系统的有效性，Kamino数据集包含近12,000张图像。

Conclusion: CMSNet在恶劣条件下能有效检测可行驶区域，适用于实时自动驾驶应用。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用植物标本馆数字化数据改进热带地区植物自动识别的潜力，通过LifeCLEF 2020挑战赛评估了跨域分类任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带地区植物多样性丰富但数据缺乏，而标本馆数字化数据可能弥补这一不足。

Method: 基于南美洲圭亚那地盾的1000种植物数据集，结合标本馆数字化数据和少量野外照片进行跨域分类训练。

Result: 挑战赛测试集仅使用野外照片，评估了跨域分类的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究表明标本馆数据可提升热带地区植物自动识别的准确性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder是一个结构化语义框架，通过将行车记录仪视频转换为层次化数据结构，提升LLM在驾驶视频分析中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理和因果推断方面表现不佳，缺乏领域特定结构。

Method: iFinder采用模块化、无需训练的方法，利用预训练视觉模型提取关键线索，并通过三块提示策略进行推理。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，iFinder显著优于端到端V-VLM，事故推理准确率提升高达39%。

Conclusion: iFinder为零样本、可解释的驾驶视频理解提供了可靠替代方案。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURE是一种无监督的机器学习框架，用于面部识别系统中的数据遗忘，无需身份标签即可移除特定样本，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别系统的广泛使用引发隐私问题，现有遗忘技术依赖身份标签，但在隐私受限或大规模噪声数据集中难以获取。

Method: 提出CURE框架和Unlearning Efficiency Score (UES)指标，通过无监督方式移除目标样本，并平衡遗忘与保留稳定性。

Result: CURE在无监督遗忘方法中表现优异，并通过低质量图像遗忘实验验证其实用性。

Conclusion: CURE填补了无监督遗忘技术的空白，为隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动注入伪影的方法，用于训练伪影检测器，避免了昂贵的人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注伪影区域成本高且数据有限，限制了检测器性能。

Method: 通过自动在高质量合成图像中注入伪影，生成像素级标注数据。

Result: 在ConvNeXt和Swin-T上分别实现了13.2%和3.7%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可扩展的像素级伪影标注数据集提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式任务特定的多任务适配方法，通过共享初始层适配器并逐步增加任务特异性，减少任务干扰和负迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在多任务学习中任务干扰和负迁移的问题。

Method: 引入渐进式任务特定适配器模块，并结合基于梯度的任务相似性分配方法。

Result: 在PASCAL和NYUD-v2数据集上表现优于全微调模型，仅需五分之一的参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在参数高效多任务学习中优于现有方法，同时减少参数数量。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RawJPEG Adapter是一种轻量级、可学习且可逆的预处理管道，将原始图像适配为标准JPEG压缩，实现高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始数据（如DNG）存储占用大，而JPEG虽高效但不适合存储原始数据。需要一种兼顾压缩效率和重建准确性的解决方案。

Method: 通过空间和可选频域变换预处理原始图像，参数存储在JPEG注释字段中，支持高精度重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比直接JPEG存储保真度更高，支持其他编解码器，压缩比与重建准确性平衡。

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter为原始图像存储提供了一种高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

### [8] [The Impact of 2D Segmentation Backbones on Point Cloud Predictions Using 4D Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19644)
*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了更高容量的分割主干网络对雷达生成LiDAR点云质量的影响，发现最优分割主干可提升23.7%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR成本高限制了自动驾驶系统的广泛应用，研究旨在通过雷达生成LiDAR点云降低成本。

Method: 使用更高容量的分割主干网络优化雷达生成点云的质量。

Result: 最优分割主干网络比现有技术提升23.7%性能。

Conclusion: 适当容量的分割主干网络能显著提升雷达生成点云的质量，但过高容量可能适得其反。

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [9] [Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659)
*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在新闻图像中吸收和复制有害社会刻板印象的风险，并提出了一个包含1,343对图像-问题的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs在处理视觉线索（如年龄、性别、种族等）时可能产生的社会偏见问题。

Method: 构建了一个新闻图像基准数据集，评估了多种VLMs，并使用LLM作为评判工具，辅以人工验证。

Result: 研究发现视觉上下文会系统性影响模型输出，不同属性和模型的偏见程度不同，性别和职业风险较高，且高保真度不一定对应低偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多模态评估中公平性的重要性，并公开了基准数据集和评估工具以支持可重复研究。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MoTiC的方法，通过贝叶斯分析和对比学习解决Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning中的估计偏差和特征紧密度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL)面临从稀缺样本学习新类同时保留旧类知识的双重挑战，现有方法存在新类原型估计偏差问题。

Method: 提出MoTiC框架，结合贝叶斯分析、大规模对比学习、动量自监督和虚拟类别，以优化特征空间。

Result: 在三个FSCIL基准测试中取得最优性能，尤其在细粒度任务CUB-200上表现突出。

Conclusion: MoTiC能有效减少估计偏差，提升增量学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用机器学习方法检测高分辨率遥感数据中的云和云影，以提升甲烷排放量化的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云和云影会影响遥感图像中甲烷浓度的准确反演，因此需要有效检测和剔除这些干扰因素。

Method: 比较了传统方法（如ILR和MLP）与深度学习模型（如UNet和SCAN），评估其在云和云影检测中的表现。

Result: 深度学习模型显著优于传统方法，UNet在保持空间结构上表现最佳，而SCAN在捕捉边界细节上更优。

Conclusion: 深度学习架构为云和云影检测提供了更鲁棒、可扩展的解决方案，有助于提升甲烷排放量化能力。

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT特征图中的结构化噪声影响了分割和深度估计等下游任务。

Method: STA通过空间扰动增强token多样性，ANF在transformer层间进行可学习的去噪。

Result: 在ImageNet等基准测试中，视觉质量和任务性能均得到提升。

Conclusion: STA和ANF是架构无关的有效方法，能显著改善ViT的实用性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理复杂时间变化（尤其是属性渐变）时表现不佳，常见的提示插值方法无法保证一致性。

Method: 在去噪过程中引入帧级引导，为每个潜在噪声构建数据特定的过渡方向，逐步调整属性并保持运动动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度、文本对齐和属性过渡平滑性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了属性渐变问题，并通过CAT-Bench和评估指标为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于解剖学约束的Transformer模型，用于心脏淀粉样变性（CA）的分类，通过限制模型关注心肌区域，提高了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络方法处理整个视频片段，无法保证分类基于临床相关特征。因此，作者希望通过约束模型关注心肌区域，确保分类与临床相关特征关联。

Method: 使用Transformer模型，并将其输入限制为心肌区域的变形点和采样图像块。此外，在自监督学习中，仅对解剖学块进行掩码和重建。

Result: 相比全视频Transformer，该方法在CA分类任务中表现更优，并能可视化注意力分数。

Conclusion: 解剖学约束的Transformer模型提高了CA分类性能，并提供了明确的临床相关性保证。

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，用于选择最优的心电图视频片段子集，以提高疾病分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么使用单一视频片段忽略其他片段的互补信息，要么使用所有片段导致计算成本高，临床应用中不可行。

Method: 通过强化学习训练代理，动态决定是否继续处理片段以减少分类不确定性，或停止处理以节省计算资源；并提出基于注意力的聚合方法融合多片段信息。

Result: 在检测心脏淀粉样变性的任务中，仅使用30%的片段即达到0.91的AUC，优于使用所有片段和其他基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少计算负担的同时提高了分类性能，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中数据稀缺问题严重，现有合成方法难以同时实现高多样性和适合医学数据的领域分布。

Method: 提出SynthICL框架，利用真实数据中的解剖先验生成多样化数据，并显式建模主体间差异。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，模型性能提升高达63%（平均Dice），泛化能力显著增强。

Conclusion: SynthICL有效缓解了数据瓶颈，为鲁棒模型的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种单目视觉-惯性运动与深度（VIMD）学习框架，通过多视角信息迭代优化像素尺度，显著提升了密集度量深度估计的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人和XR领域，精确高效的密集度量深度估计对3D视觉感知至关重要。现有方法通常采用全局不变的仿射模型，而VIMD通过多视角信息迭代优化像素尺度，以提升精度。

Method: VIMD框架利用MSCKF单目视觉-惯性运动跟踪，通过多视角信息迭代优化像素尺度，而非全局拟合仿射模型。框架高度模块化，兼容多种深度估计骨干网络。

Result: 在TartanAir和VOID数据集上验证了VIMD的零样本泛化能力，即使每张图像仅10-20个稀疏深度点，仍表现出卓越的精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VIMD在资源受限环境中具有实际部署潜力，其鲁棒性和泛化能力使其适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

TL;DR: FMISeg模型通过频域多模态交互提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病变形态复杂和视觉-语言模态语义鸿沟导致的医学图像分割性能不佳问题。

Method: 提出FMISeg模型，包含频域特征双向交互模块（FFBI）和语言引导频域特征交互模块（LFFI）。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMISeg有效提升了语言引导的医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 解决3DGS方法在复杂反射表面重建质量不足的问题。

Method: 提出PolGS模型，结合偏振约束分离镜面和漫反射成分。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PolGS在10分钟内实现高质量反射表面重建。

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: CAMILA是一种上下文感知的图像编辑方法，通过验证指令与图像的上下文一致性，避免执行不可行或矛盾的指令，从而提高编辑质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型盲目遵循所有用户指令，导致不可行或矛盾指令产生无意义输出。

Method: 提出CAMILA方法，通过上下文验证和语言对齐，确保仅对相关区域执行可行指令。

Result: CAMILA在单指令和多指令编辑任务中表现优于现有模型，语义对齐和图像完整性更优。

Conclusion: CAMILA能有效处理复杂指令，提升编辑的可行性和图像质量。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

TL;DR: VFPTrack提出了一种基于视觉傅里叶提示的RGB-T跟踪方法，结合空间和频域信息提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-T跟踪方法仅依赖空间域信息，忽略了频域信息的重要性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用共享参数的特征提取编码器，结合空间和频域提示，通过多模态特征融合生成双向交互提示。

Result: 在三个RGB-T跟踪基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: VFPTrack通过结合空间和频域信息，显著提升了RGB-T跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有解耦数据集蒸馏方法因评估协议不一致而阻碍了领域进展，RD$^3$旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$)，系统研究不同后评估设置对测试准确率的影响。

Result: 分析表明性能差异主要源于评估不一致而非合成数据质量，RD$^3$建立了标准化基准。

Conclusion: RD$^3$为未来研究提供了公平、可复现的比较基础。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

Motivation: 传统SSL_AL混合方法需要多次重训练，计算开销大且难以扩展。

Method: 在nnU-Net框架中集成熵基伪标签过滤（FilterMatch），选择性排除高置信度伪标签。

Result: 仅需5%-20%标注数据即可达到或超越全监督模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像分割提供了一种高效、可扩展的端到端学习策略。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，通过面部动作单元（AUs）实现音频驱动的精细表情控制，生成逼真的说话头部视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖情感标签或隐式AU条件，缺乏对表情的精确控制。

Method: 第一阶段使用变分运动生成器从音频和AU强度预测时间连贯的面部标志点序列；第二阶段基于扩散的合成器生成视频。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了显式AU到标志点建模的有效性。

Conclusion: 分离运动和外观提升了表情准确性、时间稳定性和视觉逼真度。

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于边距的softmax损失（如SphereFace、CosFace、ArcFace）忽略了噪声样本的影响，而干净样本和噪声样本在角度空间中的分布不同。

Method: 提出Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace)，通过在角度空间中引入指数边距，对中心区域施加更大惩罚，对边缘区域施加较小惩罚。

Result: ExpFace在训练稳定性、相似性曲线和梯度曲线方面优于现有方法，并在实验中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ExpFace通过合理设计边距损失函数，有效提升了人脸识别的性能，同时避免了现有方法的缺陷。

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Conclusion: Logics-Parsing通过强化学习和多样化数据支持，显著提升了复杂文档解析能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

TL;DR: 研究发现Dice相似系数（DSC）在评估医学图像分割时，由于器官大小的性别差异，会引入性别偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DSC作为评估指标时可能存在的性别偏差，尤其是在器官大小不同的情况下。

Method: 在50名参与者的MRI标注上应用相同大小的合成误差，独立于具体模型，量化DSC的性别差异。

Result: 小器官中DSC性别差异约为0.03，中等器官约为0.01，大器官（如肺和肝）几乎无差异。

Conclusion: DSC本身会引入性别偏差，公平性研究需注意这一点，以避免误导性结论。

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

Motivation: 解决现有多曝光融合方法在计算成本和鬼影问题上的瓶颈，提升边缘设备上的HDR成像质量。

Method: 基于Context-Aware Vision Transformer，采用YCbCr色彩空间分离信息，结合IAAF模块抑制鬼影，并通过IRE、DyT和E-MSDC实现轻量化设计。

Result: 主版本减少67% FLOPS，推理速度提升5倍（CPU）和2.5倍（边缘设备），同时保持高质量成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备提供了高效、无鬼影的HDR成像解决方案，适用于多种动态场景。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

Motivation: 现有2D/3D攻击方法多为任务独立，缺乏深度偏置控制和跨任务评估标准，BiTAA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双模型攻击框架，支持全图和局部攻击，结合复合损失函数实现检测抑制和可控深度偏置。

Result: 实验显示BiTAA能稳定实现跨任务性能下降，并揭示了检测与深度任务间的不对称转移性。

Conclusion: BiTAA揭示了多任务相机感知的实际风险，推动自动驾驶场景中跨任务防御的研究。

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CycleGAN模型在2D映射中容易扭曲恒星和星系的形态，且无法处理多光谱数据，因此需要改进以生成高保真天体图像。

Method: StrCGAN扩展了CycleGAN框架，引入3D卷积层捕获空间相关性、多光谱融合对齐光学和近红外数据，以及天体物理正则化模块保护恒星形态。

Result: StrCGAN生成的图像在视觉上更清晰且物理一致，优于标准GAN模型。

Conclusion: StrCGAN通过多光谱和3D空间处理，显著提升了天体图像增强的质量和物理一致性。

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

Motivation: 现有模型集成方法在任务和层级上存在知识冲突，导致新旧任务学习性能下降。

Method: 使用元学习训练混合系数生成器，为每层生成特定混合系数，自适应融合不同任务知识。

Result: 在多个持续学习数据集上，meta-weight-ensembler有效缓解灾难性遗忘并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: meta-weight-ensembler能灵活结合现有方法，提升持续学习效果。

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: ThinkFake是一个基于推理的AI生成图像检测框架，通过多模态大语言模型和强化学习实现高泛化性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的逼真性引发了对错误信息和隐私侵犯的担忧，现有方法泛化能力有限且缺乏解释性。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和GRPO强化学习，结合伪造推理提示和结构化检测流程。

Result: 在GenImage和LOKI基准测试中优于现有方法，表现出强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ThinkFake框架在检测AI生成图像方面具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns
about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for
accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have
made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or
depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.
In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable
framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is
trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning
with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to
perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results
validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: PersONAL是一个用于研究个性化Embodied AI的基准测试，要求代理根据自然语言查询识别、检索和导航到特定用户的物品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，代理需要适应个体人类偏好和行为，但目前缺乏相关研究。

Method: PersONAL包含2000多个高质量场景，支持主动导航和对象定位两种评估模式。

Result: 实验显示现有方法与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: PersONAL为开发能够感知和推理个性化信息的代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

Method: 提出FreezeVLA攻击框架，通过min-max双层优化生成和评估冻结攻击。

Result: 在三个VLA模型和四个机器人基准测试中，攻击成功率达76.2%，且攻击图像具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: VLA模型存在严重安全风险，亟需鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MLLM的自适应语义增强边缘云协作目标检测方法，在复杂场景中平衡了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法在复杂场景（如低光照和严重遮挡）中因缺乏高级语义理解而性能下降。

Method: 通过指令微调MLLM生成结构化场景描述，设计自适应映射机制将语义信息动态转换为边缘检测器参数调整信号，实现实时语义增强。

Result: 在低光照和高遮挡场景中，延迟降低79%，计算成本减少70%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了复杂场景下的检测准确性和效率。

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的超像素方法SphSPS，专门用于360度球形或全向图像，显著提升了分割精度和形状规则性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超像素方法主要针对标准2D平面图像，无法有效处理360度球形图像的几何特性。

Method: SphSPS方法基于3D球形采集空间的几何特性，通过最短路径提取聚类特征，并推广了全局规则性度量。

Result: 在参考数据集和合成图像上验证，SphSPS在分割精度、噪声鲁棒性和规则性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SphSPS为360度图像的超像素应用提供了高效工具，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

Motivation: 现有自监督和对比学习方法在细胞图像表示学习中面临批次效应、数据量大和模型规模大的挑战，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出CWA-MSN框架，通过跨孔对齐和掩码孪生架构，学习具有语义一致性的细胞图像表示。

Result: 在基因-基因关系检索任务中，CWA-MSN性能优于OpenPhenom和CellCLIP，分别提升29%和9%，且数据量和模型规模更小。

Conclusion: CWA-MSN是一种简单高效的方法，适用于有限数据和参数预算下的细胞表型建模。

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

Motivation: 航空与地面图像的视角差异大，导致可靠特征匹配困难，限制了复杂场景的3D建模效果。

Method: 1. 使用增量式SfM重建稀疏模型；2. 采用3D高斯泼溅进行场景渲染；3. 设计渲染视角确定算法生成中间图像；4. 通过中间图像实现可靠特征匹配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了初始和优化匹配数量，支持精确的ISfM重建和完整的3DGS渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了航空与地面图像的特征匹配问题，提升了3D建模的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching在驾驶场景和通用场景中均表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

Conclusion: 通过分解计算路径可以揭示可解释的单元，并用于下游任务。

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

Motivation: 用户难以通过文字清晰表达投诉，但视频可以直观展示问题，因此需要一种新的方法来帮助用户生成详细的投诉描述。

Method: 提出了多模态的Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)嵌入VideoLLaMA2-7b模型，结合用户情感状态生成投诉描述。

Result: 通过多种评估指标验证了模型的性能，包括METEOR、困惑度和Coleman-Liau可读性分数等。

Conclusion: 该研究为通过视频表达投诉的新研究方向奠定了基础，并提供了数据集和资源支持。

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa是一种新型音频驱动说话人脸生成框架，通过多模态情感嵌入和动态场景描述，显著提升了情感表达和动作真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖单一模态情感嵌入或静态参考图像，难以捕捉细腻情感和动态变化。

Method: 结合文本情感分析和音频情感识别，引入A2M模块和LLM生成的场景描述，实现多模态情感嵌入和动态动作生成。

Result: 在图像质量、表情保持和动作真实性上优于现有方法，用户研究显示其自然性和多样性更优。

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa通过多模态和动态条件生成，显著提升了说话人脸视频的真实性和情感表现力。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统缺乏真正的场景理解能力，主要依赖基于深度的3D重建。本文旨在填补这一差距，提出类人的场景理解框架。

Method: 提出OmniVLM框架，结合多视角和时间感知；通过知识蒸馏嵌入文本表示；采用HFS策略动态校准多模态特征的重要性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上超越十余种先进模型，在感知、预测、规划和视觉问答任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: OmniScene通过类人设计和多模态融合，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的场景理解能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

Result: 实验表明，CamPVG能生成高质量且与相机轨迹一致的全景视频，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CamPVG通过创新的姿态编码和特征聚合方法，成功解决了全景视频生成中的几何一致性问题。

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

Motivation: 沙田柚检测在复杂果园环境中面临多尺度、遮挡和小目标等挑战，需要高效准确的检测方法。

Method: 提出SDE-DET模型，结合Star Block、Deformable Attention和Efficient Multi-Scale Attention机制，提升检测能力。

Conclusion: SDE-DET为沙田柚检测提供了可靠方法，为自动化收获机器人开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的代理目标攻击方法（PTA），解决了多模态预训练模型在目标对抗攻击中的泛化性和不可检测性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对多模态预训练模型的目标对抗攻击在泛化性和不可检测性方面存在局限，需要更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 通过利用多源模态和目标模态代理优化目标对抗样本，确保其既能逃避防御又能与多个潜在目标对齐。

Result: PTA在多种相关目标上实现了高成功率，并能抵抗多种异常检测方法。

Conclusion: PTA方法显著提升了目标对抗攻击的泛化性和不可检测性，为多模态模型的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型医学数据集中基于记忆库的异常检测方法计算负担过重的问题。

Method: 使用DINOv2嵌入和Dirichlet Process Mixture模型（DPMM）建模正常特征分布，通过相似性评分生成异常分割掩码。

Result: 在医学图像基准测试中表现优异，计算时间减半，且归一化嵌入更符合解剖结构。

Conclusion: DINOv2嵌入结合DPMM是一种高效且性能优越的医学图像异常检测方法。

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/NicoSchulthess/anomalydino-dpmm.

Conclusion: 提出的主动学习方法在减少标注成本的同时，有效提升了目标检测任务的性能。

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

TL;DR: 论文提出RITA框架，将图像篡改定位任务重新定义为条件序列预测任务，通过分层预测解决现有方法的维度崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像篡改定位方法忽略篡改过程的时序性和层次性，直接生成单次预测掩码，导致维度崩溃与任务本质不匹配。

Method: 提出RITA框架，以分层方式逐步预测篡改区域，利用前一步预测作为下一步条件，显式建模编辑操作的时序依赖和层次结构。

Result: 在传统基准测试中达到SOTA，并在新构建的HSIM基准上验证了其作为通用范式的潜力。

Conclusion: RITA为图像篡改定位任务提供了更符合其本质的序列化预测范式，实验证明其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 病理报告作为临床工作流的重要组成部分，提供了补充信息，但现有方法未充分利用。融合这些异构模态存在挑战。

Method: 采用原型方法生成平衡表示，并通过Transformer融合模型处理多模态数据。

Result: 在TCGA的六个数据集上，PS3优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PS3通过有效融合多模态数据，提升了生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

Result: 实验表明该方法抗攻击性强且实用性高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护隐私，同时保持认证功能。

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

Conclusion: 冻结的通用骨干网络在物理制造领域的域转移中比完全微调更具鲁棒性，避免了对源域伪影的过拟合。

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Motivation: 当前方法在特征提取和变形场预测上缺乏专门化处理，且在所有方向上均匀预测变形。SHMoAReg旨在通过MoE机制解决这些问题。

Method: 在编码器中引入混合注意力头（MoA），动态选择最优注意力组合；在解码器中引入空间异质混合专家（SHMoE），使用不同核大小的专家预测变形场。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实验显示性能显著提升，腹部CT数据集的Dice分数从60.58%提高到65.58%。

Conclusion: SHMoAReg首次将MoE机制引入DIR任务，提升了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: DiffLI$^2$D为扩散模型在图像去雾中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的高光谱适配器有效提升了高光谱数据的语义分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

Conclusion: 合成数据的方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，提升了模型在科学视觉问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

Motivation: 现有医疗LVLMs基准过于关注准确性，忽视了可靠性和安全性，特别是在高风险的临床环境中盲目附和用户信息的风险。

Method: 通过EchoBench（包含2,122张图像和90个模拟偏见的提示）系统评估医疗LVLMs的附和现象，分析不同类型偏见、科室和模态的影响。

Result: 所有模型均表现出显著附和问题，最佳专有模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet附和率为45.98%，GPT-4.1达59.15%，部分医疗专用模型超过95%。数据质量和领域知识可减少附和。

Conclusion: 研究强调需超越准确性进行鲁棒评估，并提供了改进医疗LVLMs安全性和可信度的具体方法。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

Result: 实验表明C$^2$MIL在泛化性和可解释性上优于现有方法，并能增强多种MIL基线。

Conclusion: C$^2$MIL通过联合优化策略有效提升生存分析的因果性和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为U-Mamba2-SSL的半监督学习框架，用于CBCT图像中牙齿和牙髓的自动分割，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT图像中牙齿和牙髓的准确分割对临床至关重要，但现有方法依赖专家且耗时，需要自动化算法。

Method: 基于U-Mamba2模型，采用多阶段训练策略：自监督预训练、一致性正则化利用未标记数据、伪标签策略减少错误影响。

Result: 在验证集上平均得分为0.872，DSC为0.969，表现优异。

Conclusion: U-Mamba2-SSL框架在CBCT图像分割中表现出色，为临床提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“光学海洋配方”的框架，用于在受控水下环境中生成真实数据集，以解决水下机器视觉评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境的机器视觉开发和评估面临光学挑战（如颜色失真、对比度降低等），且缺乏通用的测试环境，导致现有方法缺乏泛化性。

Method: 通过使用校准的颜色和散射添加剂，创建可控的水下条件数据集，支持多种视觉任务的测试。

Result: 提供了一个演示数据集，并展示了该框架在两项水下视觉任务中的应用。

Conclusion: “光学海洋配方”为水下机器视觉提供了可重复且可控的测试环境，有助于提升任务的泛化性和准确性。

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对视觉语言建模自动驾驶（VLM-AD）的通用伪装攻击框架（UCA），通过特征空间优化生成物理可实现的伪装纹理，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在VLM-AD系统中存在局限性，物理攻击难以直接迁移，数字攻击集中于低层次感知。UCA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: UCA在特征空间中操作，引入特征差异损失（FDL）和多尺度学习策略，优化伪装纹理的生成。

Result: 实验表明，UCA在多种VLM-AD模型和驾驶场景中显著优于现有攻击方法（提升30%的3-P指标），且具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UCA是一种高效且实用的对抗攻击框架，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

Motivation: 解决稀疏和噪声点云在密集高保真3D表示任务中的挑战，同时保持几何可解释性和对输入稀疏性的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用各向异性3D高斯分布建模局部邻域，通过直接点采样进行上采样，再通过细化网络优化输出。

Result: 在PU1K和PUGAN数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PU-Gaussian在点云上采样任务中表现出色，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

Motivation: 质疑Geirhos等人的线索冲突实验局限性，探索CNN是否真的固有纹理偏好。

Method: 提出系统抑制形状、纹理和颜色线索的领域无关框架，避免强制选择冲突的混淆。

Result: 发现CNN主要依赖局部形状特征，非固有纹理偏好；现代训练策略可缓解依赖模式。不同领域模型特征依赖差异显著。

Conclusion: CNN特征依赖可通过训练调整，不同领域模型依赖模式系统化差异，为模型设计提供新视角。

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

Result: 在公共CT数据集上表现显著优于现有方法，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在CT切片插值中表现出色，为医学图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型难以在不进行逐场景优化的情况下，同时支持时间外推和空间新视角合成。PhiGenesis旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PhiGenesis采用两阶段方法：1）利用预训练视频VAE和范围视图适配器进行前馈4D重建；2）引入几何引导的视频扩散模型，结合Stereo Forcing策略增强几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明，PhiGenesis在外观和几何重建、时间生成及新视角合成任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PhiGenesis通过统一框架解决了4D场景生成的挑战，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and
clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and
scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

Motivation: 现有方法在融合局部细节和全局上下文时存在特征不一致和信息冲突的问题，导致分割精度受限。

Method: 提出HiPerformer，采用模块化分层架构动态融合多源特征，并设计LGFF模块和PPA模块优化特征整合。

Result: 在11个公开数据集上验证，HiPerformer优于现有方法，表现出更高的分割精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HiPerformer通过创新的特征融合和模块设计，有效解决了医学图像分割中的特征不一致问题。

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

TL;DR: PhysCtrl是一个基于物理的图像到视频生成框架，通过物理参数和力控制实现高保真和可控的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在物理合理性和3D可控性方面表现不足，PhysCtrl旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用生成物理网络学习四种材料的物理动态分布，通过扩散模型结合物理参数和力控制，并引入时空注意力块模拟粒子交互。

Result: PhysCtrl生成的视频在视觉质量和物理合理性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PhysCtrl通过物理约束和力控制，显著提升了视频生成的物理合理性和可控性。

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward
unification and scaling, showing emergent capabilities across diverse domains.
While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing
within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and
video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video
editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting
emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合频域特征的扩散模型WFDiffuser，解决了现有方法因忽略频域特征导致的频率偏移问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散概率模型在离线强化学习中主要关注时域特征，忽略了频域特征，导致频率偏移和性能下降。

Method: 提出WFDiffuser框架，结合离散小波变换将轨迹分解为低频和高频成分，并利用短时傅里叶变换和交叉注意力机制增强频域特征建模。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，WFDiffuser有效缓解了频率偏移，生成更平滑稳定的轨迹，决策性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频域特征的引入显著提升了扩散模型在离线强化学习中的表现，WFDiffuser为相关研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

Conclusion: 深度学习和中心性算法的结合为反洗钱系统提供了更高效的技术路径，未来可进一步整合新兴技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepACTIF是一种轻量级、架构感知的特征归因方法，适用于实时应用，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征归因方法（如SHAP、IG）计算量大，不适合实时应用。

Method: 利用序列模型的内部激活，通过逆加权聚合方案估计特征重要性。

Result: 在三个生物识别数据集上，DeepACTIF在计算效率和统计鲁棒性上显著优于SHAP、IG等方法。

Conclusion: DeepACTIF是边缘设备实时解释性的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增强ANFIS的混合分析方法，用于检测信用卡欺诈，通过多分辨率小波分解和时间注意力机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用卡欺诈对美国家庭财务状况构成严重威胁，导致不可预测的经济行为变化，需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 结合多分辨率小波分解和时间注意力机制的增强ANFIS模型，利用小波变换生成局部经济冲击信号，并通过自适应高斯隶属函数的模糊规则库进行推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，与局部神经模糊模型和传统LSTM模型相比，RMSE降低了17.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化训练整合小波基选择和时间相关性权重，显著提升了欺诈检测的准确性和长期依赖性捕捉能力。

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection
methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and
compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based
Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum
Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify
anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need
for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental
datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology
involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation
using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid
approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and
accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study
contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the
comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating
the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality
and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and
researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial
oversight and risk management.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在不确定性表达方面表现不佳，导致在高风险领域（如临床诊断）中可靠性不足。现有方法（如模型logits和概率估计）通常过于自信且校准性差。

Method: 采用近似贝叶斯计算（ABC），将LLM视为随机模拟器，推断预测概率的后验分布。

Result: 在两个临床相关基准测试中，ABC方法比标准基线方法提高了46.9%的准确性，降低了74.4%的Brier分数，并改善了校准性（通过ECE和预测熵衡量）。

Conclusion: ABC方法显著提升了LLM在不确定性表达和校准方面的性能，适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often
struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in
high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing
standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Result: 通过框架分析了LfO方法，并与其他相关领域（如离线RL、基于模型的RL和分层RL）建立了联系。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LfO领域的现状，指出了开放问题，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法将低秩矩阵视为独立的，缺乏系统化的张量框架。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，张量构建直接影响性能，有时优于标准LoRA。

Conclusion: TensLoRA提供了一种灵活且高效的张量低秩适应框架，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA
under similar parameter counts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing

Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well
as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined
extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration,
learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the
integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to
measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration,
mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed

TL;DR: TimeMosaic是一种多变量时间序列预测框架，通过自适应分块嵌入和分段解码解决时间异质性问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分块的方法采用固定长度分割，忽略了局部时间动态和解码异质性，导致信息丢失和冗余。

Method: TimeMosaic使用自适应分块嵌入动态调整粒度，并引入分段解码以适应不同预测范围的需求。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，大规模训练下性能接近最先进模型。

Conclusion: TimeMosaic通过处理时间异质性，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了德国电力市场价格预测中不确定性量化的方法，比较了多种统计和深度学习模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的概率预测对能源风险管理至关重要，但现有模型未能充分捕捉数据和模型选择带来的不确定性。

Method: 研究比较了深度分布神经网络（DDNNs）与LASSO估计的自回归（LEAR）方法，结合了集成方法、MC dropout和共形预测等技术。

Result: LEAR模型在概率预测中表现良好，而DDNNs通过结合数据和模型不确定性提升了预测性能。共形预测在不确定性捕捉上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 所有模型表现均具竞争力，但相对性能取决于点预测和概率预测的指标选择。

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过建模分布偏移概率和网络正确性条件概率，结合二叉树结构，更准确地评估深度学习系统在实际部署中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际部署中因对输入数据的微小变化敏感而表现不佳，导致性能指标虚高。

Method: 通过估计分布偏移概率和网络正确性条件概率，构建二叉树结构，计算网络准确性的可信和精确估计。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证，准确性估计误差通常在0.01到0.1之间，优于传统评估方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习系统提供了更准确的性能评估和风险分析框架，特别适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate
performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

TL;DR: 论文分析了跨频迁移学习（CFTL）在时间序列预测中的表现，发现现有评估方法存在不足，并提出改进方案。实证表明统计模型优于现有基础预测模型（FFMs），但合成数据预训练对FFMs有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CFTL的评估方法存在多个问题，如数据集规模小、样本量处理不当、统计模型报告不准确等，导致其性能评估不准确。

Method: 重新实现广泛采用的神经预测网络，适应CFTL设置；仅使用专有和合成数据进行预训练，避免测试泄漏；在15个大型公共数据集上评估。

Result: 统计模型及其集成在多个指标上优于现有FFMs（sCRPS提升8.2%，MASE提升20%），但合成数据预训练仍能提升FFMs 7%的准确性。

Conclusion: 统计模型在当前评估中表现更优，但合成数据预训练对FFMs有显著改进潜力，需进一步优化评估方法。

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Result: THINNs在理论和实验上均优于传统PINNs，惩罚项选择更具物理意义。

Conclusion: THINNs为PINNs提供了一种热力学一致的扩展，适用于非平衡波动系统，惩罚项选择更合理。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

TL;DR: DELTAformer通过限制变量间建模的表示能力，同时提升多变量时间序列（MTS）中Transformer的可扩展性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列（MTS）中，变量数量和变量间无差别混合是Transformer建模的主要瓶颈和性能下降的潜在原因。

Method: 提出DELTAformer，通过委托令牌（delegate tokens）限制变量间建模，同时进行无约束的时间间建模。

Result: DELTAformer在变量数量上线性扩展，性能优于标准Transformer，并在噪声环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过利用MTS的领域特定挑战，DELTAformer实现了线性扩展和性能提升的双重目标。

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Motivation: 现有CE方法因考虑数据分布特征而引入大量约束，导致计算成本高。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持解释质量的同时显著缩短求解时间。

Conclusion: 改进的LOF建模在CE和数据科学应用中具有高效潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

Result: 在QM9数据集上，GFD结合EdgeDiT实现了最佳性能，测试NLL为-137.97（标准尺度）和-141.85（双尺度），原子稳定性98.98%，分子稳定性90.51%。

Conclusion: 基于框架的扩散是一种可扩展、灵活且物理基础扎实的分子生成范式，强调了全局结构保存的重要性。

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

Motivation: 传统神经代理方法在长时滚动中可能注入能量导致不稳定，MCFM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MCFM通过条件流匹配训练短时过渡，推理时采用Strang-prox方案交替进行辛更新和近端度量步骤。

Result: MCFM在机械基准测试中表现出更接近真实相图和更少的能量增加事件，同时保持终端分布拟合。

Conclusion: MCFM通过结合保守和耗散特性，实现了稳定且能量衰减的动力学模拟。

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics
without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and
destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the
conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure
preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short
transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme
alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete
energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted
energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking
this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and
stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase
portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and
positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural
flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Result: 实验表明，DAWM显著提升了TD3BC和IQL等保守离线RL算法的性能。

Conclusion: DAWM通过模块化设计，实现了高效且兼容性强的离线强化学习训练。

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

Conclusion: 该框架减少实验数据需求，有助于合成生物电路和多模块系统设计。

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

Result: 多模态模型在‘新抗体、无数据’场景下表现优异，预测准确率高。

Conclusion: 多模态模型能有效指导抗体设计，提高实验效率。

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的vMF哈希损失有效减少了信息损失，提升了语义检索性能。

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at

Motivation: Transformer模型的注意力机制复杂度高，Mamba作为替代架构表现出色，但在长上下文任务中性能下降，需探究原因并改进。

Method: 分析Mamba的状态空间动态，发现状态转移矩阵谱特性影响长度扩展性能，提出谱缩放方法调整矩阵谱。

Result: 谱缩放方法显著提升了Mamba在长上下文任务中的性能，验证了状态转移矩阵谱特性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过谱缩放方法，Mamba的长上下文性能得到改善，为状态空间模型的长度泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein
and KS distances.

Result: 模型在低预测试概率病例表现更好；在平衡测试集上性能显著下降，表明部分性能可能依赖临床背景。

Conclusion: 结合临床背景的分析方法为临床视觉模型提供了更严谨和细粒度的评估方向。

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

Result: 在多个FCL基准测试中表现最优。

Conclusion: C²Prompt通过增强类间知识一致性，有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的时空遗忘问题。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究持续学习中梯度步长不再带来改进的现象，即训练能力丧失（LoT），并探索其根本原因。

Method: 通过优化视角分析LoT，引入梯度噪声和曲率波动控制的预测标准，构建层调度器以限制有效步长。

Result: 提出的层调度器能够稳定训练，并在多种正则化方法中提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过预测标准和层调度器，可以有效解决持续学习中的训练能力丧失问题。

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Result: 模型隐含发现了统一的参数无关更新规则，适用于不同计算场景，并证明其高效性。

Conclusion: Transformer通过上下文学习能自动发现资源自适应的迭代求解器，展示了强大的学习能力。

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

Motivation: 传统统计方法在处理复杂、异质性数据时受限，无法准确估计个性化治疗效果。

Method: 开发了X-MultiTask框架，结合逆概率加权（IPW）增强因果有效性，并在两个数据集上评估。

Result: 模型在脊柱融合和脊柱侧弯数据集中表现最佳，AUC和误差指标均优于基线。

Conclusion: X-MultiTask为个性化手术决策提供了强大工具，有望改善患者预后。

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

the models robustness in accurately predicting blood pressure levels
Furthermore the training and validation loss analysis demonstrates effective

Result: 算法鲁棒性强，在标准连续控制基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: Frictional Q-learning通过物理启发的约束有效解决了外推误差问题。

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss

compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of
this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present
the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training

student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we
derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the
improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep
learning tasks.

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world

Result: Tanbr在延迟和内存使用上分别减少至少45%和25%，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: Tanbr是一种高效且可靠的在线MoE推理方法，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在大规模驾驶数据集上评估，RDAR在保持驾驶性能的同时显著减少了处理的代理数量。

Conclusion: RDAR能够准确学习代理相关性，降低计算成本，同时保持驾驶性能。

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

Result: 在五个数学基准和两个模型上验证了VCRL的优势。

Conclusion: VCRL通过模拟人类认知过程提升了LLM在数学推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Result: 实验表明CSF在多种非线性滤波场景中具有高精度、鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: CSF为高维非线性滤波提供了一种无需重复训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear
filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based
diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Motivation: 为KANs提供理论支持，验证其在非参数回归中的潜力。

Method: 使用B-spline表示单变量分量，分析加性和混合加乘KANs的收敛性。

Result: 证明KANs在Sobolev空间中达到最优收敛速率$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$。

Conclusion: KANs是一种有结构且可解释的非参数回归方法，理论结果支持其应用。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

TL;DR: BoreaRL是一个多目标强化学习环境，用于优化北方森林管理中的碳封存和永久冻土保护，揭示了碳目标比冻土目标更容易优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北方森林储存大量碳，但管理碳封存和保护永久冻土之间存在复杂权衡，现有工具无法解决。

Method: 引入BoreaRL，一个基于物理模拟器的多目标强化学习环境，支持两种训练模式：站点特定模式和通用模式。

Result: 碳目标比冻土目标更容易优化，通用模式下标准方法失败，而课程学习方法表现更好。

Conclusion: BoreaRL为气候适应性森林管理提供了有价值的基准，展示了当前多目标强化学习方法的挑战。

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

Method: 通过系统实证研究，测试多种先进方法在分布内和分布外数据上的性能。

Result: 预训练模型在分布内表现良好，但在分布外场景中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 泛化差距是预训练方法在实际应用中的关键障碍。

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在不平衡分类任务中因未能区分关键实例和冗余样本而导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 通过边界数据过采样和核心感知数据缩减方法，优化数据集。

Result: 边界数据过采样方法在96%的数据集上F1分数提升10%，核心感知缩减方法压缩数据集90%且保持准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于不平衡分类，还可扩展到高效模型训练领域，为数据高效学习提供新思路。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force
expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is

<details>

Motivation: 传统DFT方法计算效率低，而现有深度学习方法在多样性和高维复杂性上表现不佳，因此需要一种更通用的深度学习范式。

Method: 提出NextHAM，结合初始电荷密度构建的哈密顿量描述符、E(3)-对称Transformer架构和双空间训练目标。

Result: 在Materials-HAM-SOC数据集上，NextHAM在哈密顿量和能带结构预测中表现出色。

Conclusion: NextHAM为电子结构预测提供了一种高效且通用的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has
offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT
methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the
high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the
generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology
and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian
prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and
expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials
electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Motivation: 现有多校准方法需要手动指定子组、不可扩展或可能损害其他模型性能指标，限制了工业应用。

Method: MCGrad无需显式指定保护组，具有可扩展性，并能改善其他ML评估指标。

Result: MCGrad已在Meta的生产环境中部署，成为数百个生产模型的一部分，并在公开数据集上验证了其效果。

Conclusion: MCGrad是一种高效且实用的多校准算法，适用于工业场景。

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in

relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on

learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series

Method: 使用EM循环迭代优化提示合成，生成更难、更多样的问题。

Result: 在自学习和监督微调中均显著提升模型性能，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: PromptCoT 2.0为开源模型提供了可扩展的推理基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

Motivation: 研究结构化随机多臂老虎机中的纯探索问题，旨在高效地从有限假设集中识别正确假设。

Method: 提出Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP)算法，通过零和博弈视角和连续时间分析，解决非唯一最优解、边界非光滑性等挑战。

Result: 证明了FWSP在最佳臂识别问题中的收敛性，并通过数值实验验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: FWSP是一种无需投影、正则化和调参的方法，适用于结构化随机多臂老虎机问题，具有全局收敛性。

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits,
aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of
alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a
maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation
between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements
to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We
reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy,
yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to
Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free,
tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit
sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies
that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study
exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm,
bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these
challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the
game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds
through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov
function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and
convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires
differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we
show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from
pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the
optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed
flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we
further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

Result: LIRF在AFHQ-Cat数据集上生成高质量图像，并通过收敛定理证明了生成数据与真实数据流形距离的减小。

Conclusion: LIRF为数据稀缺的生成建模提供了理论支持且实际有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from
limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling.
Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and
mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting
the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these
limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel
approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of
geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using
an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss}
$L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the
geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we
propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle,
candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a
provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while
preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem}
demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated
and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by
generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies
confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive
correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF
provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only
theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

Conclusion: 需要设计更稳健的贡献评估方案以应对架构敏感性和恶意攻击。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Conclusion: 基础模型更适合用于引导探索而非端到端控制，混合框架展示了其潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly
in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic
priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL
benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed
bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our
investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level
objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level
control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,
we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case
scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can
significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis
of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide
exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting
Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we
revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced
protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20
examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art
prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a
probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic
mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii)
Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a
multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript,
and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains
transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this
is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as
models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have
recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level
while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite
evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this
work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic
tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we
propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to
reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is
non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed
feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data
distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,
achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as
higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly
efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,
TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across
various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized
datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,
making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

Conclusion: RaNNDy在减少计算成本的同时保持准确性，适用于复杂动态系统分析，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning
transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of
the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the
output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable
reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time
and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such
as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the
proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output
layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover,
it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral
properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical
operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have
important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the
strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several
stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum
harmonic oscillator.

Motivation: 探讨视频模型是否能够像大型语言模型（LLM）一样，从特定任务模型发展为通用基础模型。

Method: 利用Veo 3模型，测试其在未明确训练的任务上的表现，如对象分割、边缘检测、图像编辑等。

Result: Veo 3能够完成多种视觉任务，表现出早期视觉推理能力，如迷宫和对称性解决。

Conclusion: 视频模型正朝着统一、通用的视觉基础模型方向发展，具备类似LLM的潜力。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LSD的可学习采样器蒸馏方法，用于加速离散扩散模型的采样过程，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDMs）在文本和分子等离散数据生成方面表现出色，但采样效率低，大步长加速会导致生成质量下降。

Method: 通过蒸馏方法，让学生采样器（步数少）学习对齐教师采样器（步数多）的中间得分轨迹，并优化可学习采样系数。LSD+进一步学习非均匀时间调度。

Result: 在文本生成、图像生成和合成任务中，LSD和LSD+在较少采样步数下显著提高了采样质量。

Conclusion: LSD和LSD+有效解决了DDMs采样效率低的问题，同时保持了高质量的生成结果。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for
discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical
application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of
sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically
introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the
impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and
discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant
decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable
sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity
samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler
with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of
a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved
by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling
dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time
schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text
generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed
approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially
higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率时间序列预测范式“概率场景”，通过直接生成有限数量的{场景,概率}对，避免了蒙特卡洛近似的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于采样的概率时间序列预测模型存在缺乏显式概率、覆盖不足和高计算成本等问题。

Method: 提出了“概率场景”范式，并设计了简单模型TimePrism，仅由三个并行线性层组成。

Result: TimePrism在五个基准数据集上取得了9/10的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 概率场景范式通过重新定义学习目标，展示了在预测领域超越采样的潜力。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on
sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from
inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate
coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address
the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of
\{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation.
To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model
composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves
9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two
metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing
of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability
space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and
corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the
Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in
forecasting beyond sampling.

TL;DR: OPLoRA是一种内存高效的优化器，通过交替最小二乘更新改进LoRA微调，显著减少内存使用并接近SVDLoRA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA微调与全训练低秩投影（SVDLoRA）之间存在性能差距，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将LoRA优化转化为可解释的子问题，用交替最小二乘更新高效求解，支持动量和K-FAC度量。

Result: 在线性任务、MNIST、CIFAR-100和RoBERTa-base上，OPLoRA接近SVDLoRA性能，内存使用显著减少。

Conclusion: OPLoRA是一种高效且内存友好的优化器，适用于低秩适应任务。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank
updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters
and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank
projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be
further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient
optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable
sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates,
where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely
match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the
recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA
supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine
(LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of
LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled
variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear
task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches
SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的医学研究主要依赖隐式编码知识，忽视了任务特定知识的需求。

Method: RAD通过检索和精炼疾病中心知识、指南增强对比损失和双变压器解码器三种机制实现。

Result: 在四个数据集上展示了RAD的泛化能力和最先进性能，同时提高了模型的解释性。

Conclusion: RAD不仅提升了诊断性能，还使模型更专注于异常区域和关键指标，确保基于证据的可信诊断。

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列中的异常通常源于时序上下文和跨通道协调，而非孤立离群点，需要一种结合物理先验的方法。

Method: 提出Pi-Transformer，包含数据驱动的序列注意力和编码时序不变性的先验注意力，通过重建目标和分歧项训练。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争力强的F1分数，尤其在时序和相位异常检测上表现突出。

Conclusion: 嵌入物理先验的注意力机制为复杂多变量系统提供了校准且鲁棒的异常检测方法。

Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and
cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present
Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a
data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that
encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase
synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction
error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence
term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them
meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is
lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model
combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch
signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a
single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and
PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with
particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show
complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around
regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a
calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate
systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub
repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

Motivation: 渗透测试模拟网络攻击以识别安全漏洞，但部分可观测性挑战了传统的马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），需要更复杂的基准来反映现实世界的复杂性。

Method: 使用PPO及其变体（如帧堆叠、历史信息增强、循环或基于Transformer的架构）在部分可观测的主机网络中进行实验。

Result: 历史信息聚合显著提升了任务性能，收敛速度比其他方法快三倍，且学习到的策略在定性分析中表现出明显差异。

Conclusion: 历史信息聚合对部分可观测的渗透测试任务至关重要，能够开发出更鲁棒和可迁移的策略，适用于多样化的现实环境。

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security
vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for
reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to
real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it
invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state
estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially
observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size,
aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and
representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more
robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable
performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using
vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a
selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including
frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and
employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We
find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three
times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies
by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go
beyond quantitative results.

Result: 在PhysioNet 2017 ECG数据集上达到AUROC 0.7815。

Conclusion: DACL通过扩散过程驱动对比目标，生成噪声不变的嵌入，为类可分性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal
filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and
engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework,
\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state
estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various
experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state
estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in
pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,
LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,
we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating
task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.
Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,
capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen
environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where
accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These
findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QML依赖多次测量，导致高成本和时间开销，Yomo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Yomo用概率聚合机制替代Pauli期望值输出，并引入鼓励锐利预测的损失函数。

Result: 理论分析和实验（MNIST、CIFAR-10）表明Yomo优于基线，尤其在单次测量下表现突出。

Conclusion: Yomo大幅降低QML的部署成本，推动其实际应用。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated
measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This
dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time
overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is
typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose
You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves
accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the
single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a
probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage
sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the
shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms
baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing
channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially
reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby
lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine
learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently
incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing
data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based
framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To
this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed
context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting
strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing
query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate
imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete
data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating
that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic
convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity
conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks,
including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance
in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and
imputing partially observed dynamics.

Result: 实验表明，改进后的Aerial+在五个真实数据集上比现有方法快1-2个数量级，且规则质量显著提升。

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in
datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge
discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making.
However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational
overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective
search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks.
Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address
the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the
data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced
performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in
high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales
one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and
neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce
the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene
expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50
samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular
foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve
rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs)
under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm
whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art
best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the
stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but
unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby
handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we
provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint
violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early
episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime,
\emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our
algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition,
and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained}
optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation
factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing
the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 揭示了数据分布如何引导嵌入结构形成的新机制。

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative
samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative
adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process,
yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the
private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we
begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic
inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis
reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by
projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out
off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with
the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with
standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations
from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant
directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become
more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the
generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training
objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we
further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold
alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

TL;DR: StrAD是一种新型的结构增强异常检测方法，通过整合时间序列中的结构信息来改进重建模型的优化目标，从而提升对复杂模式异常的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于异常标签稀缺且手动标注成本高，无监督的重建方法受到关注，但现有方法仅依赖逐点距离度量，忽略了时间序列的结构特征，难以检测复杂模式异常。

Method: StrAD在优化目标中整合了趋势、季节性和形状等结构信息，确保原始数据与重建数据在结构特征上对齐，保持全局波动和局部特性的一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，StrAD在五个真实异常检测数据集上提升了现有重建模型的性能。

Conclusion: StrAD通过结构增强的优化目标机制，显著提升了重建模型对点异常和模式异常的检测能力，且具有可插拔性，适用于任何重建方法。

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出FairEquityFL框架，旨在解决联邦学习在动态异构车联网环境中客户端选择公平性问题，通过采样均衡器和异常检测机制提升公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网应用中存在客户端选择不公平的问题，现有框架未充分考虑动态异构环境下的公平性。

Method: 引入采样均衡器模块确保客户端选择公平性，并采用异常检测机制识别恶意客户端。

Result: 在FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，FairEquityFL显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: FairEquityFL有效提升了联邦学习在车联网环境中的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of
applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy
preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead.
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can
be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the
clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent
to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of
researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL
frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed
fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV
environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework
to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL
training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module
within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair
collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.
The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling
the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier
detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the
model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or
loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily
suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further
evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,
FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline
models to a considerable extent.

Motivation: 传统输入扰动方法未考虑数据底层结构，限制了正则化效果。

Method: 通过投影高斯噪声到流形切空间，并沿测地线映射到流形上，同时考虑布朗运动噪声。

Result: 在高度弯曲流形上提升泛化能力和超参数鲁棒性，简单流形上表现不劣于无噪声训练。

Conclusion: 几何感知噪声方法适用于学习的数据流形，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly
regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and
enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the
addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the
underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of
adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional
manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian
noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise
sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also
consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and
robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while
performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our
proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular,
but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP
employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its
practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of
estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any
identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex
graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its
computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible
Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational
performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets,
highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Method: 提出T-HénonNets架构，设计为辛结构，支持自适应时间步长，并扩展至非自治系统。

Result: 提供了可分离哈密顿系统的通用逼近定理，并通过数值实验验证理论能力。

Conclusion: T-HénonNets能有效处理自适应时间步长，但对非可分离哈密顿系统仍有挑战。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and
H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called
TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar
extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture
called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive
time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems
for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it
is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed
methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we
perform different numerical experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 减少大型语言模型（LLM）推理时的内存占用和延迟，特别是在边缘设备等内存受限场景中。

Method: 通过旋转方法将权重转换为近高斯分布，提出信息论最优位分配，并引入Q-Palette量化器集合。

Result: Q-Palette实现了接近最优的量化性能，并在不同比特宽度下高效实现。

Conclusion: Q-Palette和混合方案量化框架为LLM的高效量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the
weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no
calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint
and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference
scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its
importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs
complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that
transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with
fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first
derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized
weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit
quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to
achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical
insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile
collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded
quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar
quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with
optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging
Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme
quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion
decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at

Motivation: 动态环境中输入数据分布的变化（如传感器漂移或光照变化）需要模型持续适应，而单一静态模型无法满足需求。

Method: 先使用反向传播离线训练深度神经网络以获得高性能，再使用预测编码进行在线适应，以恢复因数据分布变化而损失的准确性。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，该方法能以较低计算开销实现有效适应。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了反向传播的鲁棒性和预测编码的计算效率，适用于资源受限的边缘设备或神经形态加速器。

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遗忘方法在损失景观中驱动模型参数至尖锐最小值，导致信息易被恢复。

Method: 提出StableUN，通过邻域感知优化寻找稳定参数区域，结合遗忘和记忆反馈。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准测试中，StableUN显著提升对抗再学习和越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StableUN填补了表面遗忘与实际知识移除之间的鲁棒性差距。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that
undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove
sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains
precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root
cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual
data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss
landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can
drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks
exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate
the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly
recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical
robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To
address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided
optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via
neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses
adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering
feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through
gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that
our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and
jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Conclusion: HGMamba-ncRNA为复杂非编码RNA功能分类提供了新颖可靠的策略。

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is
essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing
limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose
HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which
integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression
features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the
sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM
architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies
of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer
(MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics
of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev
Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and
interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating
virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction,
HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel
heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets
demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies
further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong
transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA
functional classification. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 随着AI推理规模扩大和推理工作流程的复杂性增加，准确估算每查询能耗对容量规划、排放核算和效率优化至关重要。

Method: 采用基于令牌吞吐量的自下而上方法，结合GPU利用率和PUE约束，估算H100节点上运行的模型的能耗。

Result: 前沿规模模型（>2000亿参数）的每查询能耗中位数为0.34 Wh（IQR: 0.18-0.67），非生产估算可能高估4-20倍。效率提升可带来8-20倍的能耗降低。

Conclusion: 通过模型、服务平台和硬件层面的效率优化，可以显著降低能耗，类似于数据中心在互联网和云建设期间通过效率提升控制能耗增长的模式。

Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and
agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy
use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and
efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate
energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to
reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce
a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM
systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under
realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median
energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200
billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using
production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and
assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling
scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x
to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver
the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the
model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median
reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can
plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we
estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion
queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8
GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,
similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how
data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains
during the internet and cloud build-up.

Conclusion: 结合结构化滞后、发票级闭合建模和行为洞察，显著提升了稀疏金融时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly
challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and
user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse
datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional
time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have
shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial
observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature
engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical
statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates
invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom
stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and
irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%
reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial
financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over
quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both
short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and
simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of
combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral
insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series
forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Conclusion: xLRA为微观结构与弹性响应的高效预测提供了可扩展的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of
heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet
this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of
microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the
microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the
development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property
linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven
approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To
address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation
(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It
efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local
elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately
predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a
maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate
predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant
data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results
across representative material systems, including two phase composites and
single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains
essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen
microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods
in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while
requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,
xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from
microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,
underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen
novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates
in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high
bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,
computational models specifically designed to predict associations between
oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a
prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover
potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,
microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic
information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a
prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful
paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global
features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a
benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and
hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies
further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to
uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer
valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug
development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at

Motivation: LLM-judged benchmarks的设计可能导致高置信度但实际噪声较大的排名结果，需要验证其可靠性。

Method: 提出Schematic adherence和Psychometric validity两种机制，用于量化评测中的不一致性和不确定性。

Result: 发现Arena-Hard Auto中评测模式不连贯（如DeepSeek-R1-32B的未解释方差超过90%）和因素崩溃（相关性高于0.93）。

Conclusion: LLM-judged benchmarks的设计缺陷可能削弱其有效性，并提出了改进原则。

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model
behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional
ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and
verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence
rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to
diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's
overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing
unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric
validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to
quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools
to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse
across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent
for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We
also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and
masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that
undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped,
reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at

*Dongming Huang,Zhifan Li,Yicheng Li,Qian Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的复杂性度量——有效跨度维度（ESD），用于分析数据驱动核的谱算法性能，并证明了其在序列模型中的极小化风险与ESD的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定核理论无法完全解释数据驱动核的泛化性能，因此需要一种新的复杂性度量来联合考虑信号、谱和噪声水平。

Method: 引入ESD作为复杂性度量，分析其在序列模型中的极小化风险，并研究梯度流如何降低ESD。

Result: 证明了ESD与极小化风险的关系，并发现梯度流可以降低ESD，从而改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: ESD框架为理解数据驱动核的泛化性能提供了新视角，超越了传统固定核理论。

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

TL;DR: GVNNs是一种结合图信号处理和动态时空信号的神经网络层，用于建模动态演变的时空信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN需要预定义的图结构，而GVSA框架可以从信号本身构建动态功能网络，GVNNs旨在结合GVSA和GNN的优势。

Method: GVNNs通过卷积时空信号与信号依赖的连接张量，结合长期稳定支持和瞬时数据驱动交互。

Result: GVNNs在预测基准测试中优于图基线模型，与LSTM和Transformer竞争，并在EEG分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: GVNNs展示了在脑机接口等应用中的潜力，能够高效建模动态统计依赖关系。

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.

Motivation: 研究稀疏网络权重的结构特性，以解决神经网络稀疏恢复问题，同时减少内存消耗。

Method: 采用迭代硬阈值算法，针对两层标量输出网络，分析稀疏权重的结构特性。

Result: 实验验证了理论结果，在稀疏MLP恢复、MNIST分类和隐式神经表示任务中表现优异，甚至优于内存效率较低的高性能基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏恢复任务中具有竞争力，且内存效率更高，为神经网络稀疏恢复提供了新的理论保证。

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks,
where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered.
Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for
two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard
thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows
linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result
with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST
classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find
performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but
memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨深度网络泛化能力的原因，超越传统理论，关注内部特征的动态变化。

Method: 研究输入输出及内部特征的演化，分析时间一致性现象及其对泛化的影响。

Result: 时间一致性在未见和损坏数据中仍存在，但在语义结构破坏时消失；SGD噪声各向异性，支持结构化变异性。

Conclusion: 特征动态与泛化能力相关，未来可研究测量时间特征演化的实用方法。

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization
theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and
outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a
phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow
features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.
This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of
implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that
temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when
semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests
further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal
directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.
Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature
dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates
for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Result: 发现图推理中的两个核心机制：token合并和结构记忆，并量化了它们受图密度和模型大小的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为理解解码器-only Transformer的结构推理提供了统一的解释框架。

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning
tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these
reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the
basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer
framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two
core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,
which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We
further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph
density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework
for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS框架通过时空有向图重新定义ATO检测，显著提升AUC并减少用户摩擦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在ATO欺诈检测中忽略关系和时序结构的问题。

Method: 使用时空有向图进行节点分类，结合因果消息传递和延迟感知标签传播。

Result: 在Capital One的高风险数字产品中，AUC提升6.38%，用户摩擦减少50%以上。

Conclusion: ATLAS框架有效提升欺诈检测性能，同时降低对合法用户的干扰。

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer
banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction
for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular
gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions
independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online
activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce
ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a
framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node
classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links
entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates
connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,
time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses
only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We
operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor
sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B
edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38
percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer
friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业监控需要高精度时间序列预测，但现有深度学习模型因物理不一致性和鲁棒性问题难以在受监管环境中可靠部署。

Method: 研究了从ARIMA、ETS到KANs等多种模型，并比较了三种整合过程信息的损失函数：固定权重损失、动态不确定性损失和基于残差的注意力机制（RBA）。

Result: PIF模型在准确性、物理合理性和抗噪性上均优于纯数据驱动模型，且在迁移学习中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PIF为制药制造等关键应用提供了可靠且可泛化的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone
of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel
at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to
physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in
regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models
for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range
of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning
architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three
different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed
trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for
accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.
Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a
transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models
outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical
plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing
reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in
the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HUNT框架通过相对导航实现无人机在未知环境中的高速搜索与目标跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在感知受限和无全局定位情况下的高速搜索与目标跟踪问题。

Method: 提出HUNT框架，基于机载实时观测数据（姿态、高度、速度）进行导航和目标跟踪。

Result: 在密集森林、集装箱区域和搜救任务中展示了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HUNT在全局方法失效的场景下实现了高效自主导航与跟踪。

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both
traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once
detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global
localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation
have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible
detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field
of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time
framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single
relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard
instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling
reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same
perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor
experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue
operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where
global methods fail.

Result: 在5个模拟和3个真实任务中，ROPA优于基线方法，展示了其在数据增强中的潜力。

Conclusion: ROPA为第三人称RGB和RGB-D数据增强提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning
requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and
scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world
demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior
works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either
eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel
images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand
(third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this
paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data
Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method
that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D
observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates
corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained
optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate
gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our
method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625
simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms
baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data
augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Motivation: 解决模仿学习中大规模专家演示成本高的问题，提出在有限监督下通过模拟器交互生成高质量演示的方法。

Method: 使用双级增强（模型级EMA和环境级初始位置变化）和轻量级选择器，从模拟器中收集成功轨迹作为新演示进行迭代优化。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SEIL在少样本模仿学习场景下达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SEIL通过模拟器交互和双级增强，显著减少了训练所需的专家演示数量，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent
across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which
are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited
supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework
that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions.
The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful
trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To
enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level
augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model
to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing
slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a
lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories
from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples
enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training
examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves
a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

Result: CU-Multi数据集提供了丰富的语义标注和轨迹重叠变化，适用于多机器人协作感知任务。

Conclusion: CU-Multi为多机器人系统的协作感知任务提供了标准化和可重复的评估基础。

Abstract: A central challenge for multi-robot systems is fusing independently gathered
perception data into a unified representation. Despite progress in
Collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), benchmarking remains hindered by the scarcity of
dedicated multi-robot datasets. Many evaluations instead partition single-robot
trajectories, a practice that may only partially reflect true multi-robot
operations and, more critically, lacks standardization, leading to results that
are difficult to interpret or compare across studies. While several multi-robot
datasets have recently been introduced, they mostly contain short trajectories
with limited inter-robot overlap and sparse intra-robot loop closures. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CU-Multi, a dataset collected over
multiple days at two large outdoor sites on the University of Colorado Boulder
campus. CU-Multi comprises four synchronized runs with aligned start times and
controlled trajectory overlap, replicating the distinct perspectives of a robot
team. It includes RGB-D sensing, RTK GPS, semantic LiDAR, and refined
ground-truth odometry. By combining overlap variation with dense semantic
annotations, CU-Multi provides a strong foundation for reproducible evaluation
in multi-robot collaborative perception tasks.

Conclusion: COBRA为月球资源勘探提供了新的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: NASA aims to establish a sustainable human basecamp on the Moon as a stepping
stone for future missions to Mars and beyond. The discovery of water ice on the
Moon's craters located in permanently shadowed regions, which can provide
drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel, is therefore of critical importance.
However, current methods to access lunar ice deposits are limited. While rovers
have been used to explore the lunar surface for decades, they face significant
challenges in navigating harsh terrains, such as permanently shadowed craters,
due to the high risk of immobilization. This report introduces COBRA (Crater
Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator), a multi-modal snake-style robot
designed to overcome mobility challenges in Shackleton Crater's rugged
environment. COBRA combines slithering and tumbling locomotion to adapt to
various crater terrains. In snake mode, it uses sidewinding to traverse flat or
low inclined surfaces, while in tumbling mode, it forms a circular barrel by
linking its head and tail, enabling rapid movement with minimal energy on steep
slopes. Equipped with an onboard computer, stereo camera, inertial measurement
unit, and joint encoders, COBRA facilitates real-time data collection and
autonomous operation. This paper highlights COBRAs robustness and efficiency in
navigating extreme terrains through both simulations and experimental
validation.

Motivation: 现有机器人导航策略通常仅针对单一模态训练，限制了其在多样化现实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用高容量视觉-语言-动作（VLA）主干网络，通过随机模态融合策略训练多种目标模态及其组合。

Result: OmniVLA在未见环境中表现优异，对稀缺模态具有鲁棒性，并能理解新语言指令。

Conclusion: OmniVLA为构建通用多模态机器人基础模型提供了灵活且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such
as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when
navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation
policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to
real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural
and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic
foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based
navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)
backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric
images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a
randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of
usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,
semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves
strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,
and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate
that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a
flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe
OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation
policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation
models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its
checkpoints and training code on our project page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器人对反应速度的需求增加，但机载处理器受限于体积、功耗和成本，HPC卸载提供了一种潜在解决方案。

Method: 使用并行化多目标A*搜索算法，在本地和远程HPC集群上实现轨迹规划，评估网络延迟和抖动对实时性的影响。

Result: 在躲避高速泡沫弹的测试中，本地和远程HPC的平均规划延迟分别为22.9 ms和30.0 ms，避障成功率分别为84%和88%。

Conclusion: SHARP证明在延迟可控的情况下，HPC卸载是实现高反应速度机器人的可行方案，并提出了混合控制架构的设计思路。

Abstract: This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and
Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance
computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control.
While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human--robot
shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost.
Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its
feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and
jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator
must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a parallelized multi-goal A*
search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system
achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300
km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These
results show that when round-trip latency remains within the
tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck,
enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate
hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety,
while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for
scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study
provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of
HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable
pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Gesture-based control for mobile manipulators faces persistent challenges in
reliability, efficiency, and intuitiveness. This paper presents a dual-hand
gesture interface that integrates TinyML, spectral analysis, and sensor fusion
within a ROS framework to address these limitations. The system uses left-hand
tilt and finger flexion, captured using accelerometer and flex sensors, for
mobile base navigation, while right-hand IMU signals are processed through
spectral analysis and classified by a lightweight neural network. This pipeline
enables TinyML-based gesture recognition to control a 7-DOF Kinova Gen3
manipulator. By supporting simultaneous navigation and manipulation, the
framework improves efficiency and coordination compared to sequential methods.
Key contributions include a bimanual control architecture, real-time low-power
gesture recognition, robust multimodal sensor fusion, and a scalable ROS-based
implementation. The proposed approach advances Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
for industrial automation, assistive robotics, and hazardous environments,
offering a cost-effective, open-source solution with strong potential for
real-world deployment and further optimization.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习（RL）在单次硬件部署中实现软机器人动态平衡控制，克服非线性、滞后和大变形等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决软机器人闭环控制中的非线性响应和动态负载问题，避免传统方法对配置空间的低效利用。

Method: 采用基于扩展邻域的课程学习方法和最大扩散RL，在3D打印软执行器构建的Stewart平台上进行实验。

Conclusion: 单次学习硬件部署为软机器人系统在现实世界中可靠学习提供了可能，将推动更强大和多样化的软机器人发展。

Abstract: Closed-loop control remains an open challenge in soft robotics. The nonlinear
responses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of
analytic models for soft robot control. Traditional methods of controlling soft
robots underutilize their configuration spaces to avoid nonlinearity,
hysteresis, large deformations, and the risk of actuator damage. Furthermore,
episodic data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) are
traditionally limited by sample efficiency and inconsistency across
initializations. In this work, we demonstrate RL for reliably learning control
policies for dynamic balancing tasks in real-time single-shot hardware
deployments. We use a deformable Stewart platform constructed using parallel,
3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic (HSA)
structures. By introducing a curriculum learning approach based on expanding
neighborhoods of a known equilibrium, we achieve reliable single-deployment
balancing at arbitrary coordinates. In addition to benchmarking the performance
of model-based and model-free methods, we demonstrate that in a single
deployment, Maximum Diffusion RL is capable of learning dynamic balancing after
half of the actuators are effectively disabled, by inducing buckling and by
breaking actuators with bolt cutters. Training occurs with no prior data, in as
fast as 15 minutes, with performance nearly identical to the fully-intact
platform. Single-shot learning on hardware facilitates soft robotic systems
reliably learning in the real world and will enable more diverse and capable
soft robots.

Abstract: Despite the rapidly growing applications of robots in industry, the use of
robots to automate tasks in scientific laboratories is less prolific due to
lack of generalized methodologies and high cost of hardware. This paper focuses
on the automation of characterization tasks necessary for reducing cost while
maintaining generalization, and proposes a software architecture for building
robotic systems in scientific laboratory environment. A dual-layer (Socket.IO
and ROS) action server design is the basic building block, which facilitates
the implementation of a web-based front end for user-friendly operations and
the use of ROS Behavior Tree for convenient task planning and execution. A
robotic platform for automating mineral and material sample characterization is
built upon the architecture, with an open source, low-cost three-axis computer
numerical control gantry system serving as the main robot. A handheld laser
induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analyzer is integrated with a 3D printed
adapter, enabling automated 2D chemical mapping. We demonstrate the utility of
automated chemical mapping by scanning of the surface of a spodumene-bearing
pegmatite core sample with a 1071-point dense hyperspectral map acquired at a
rate of 1520 bits per second. Automated LIBS scanning enables controlled
chemical quantification in the laboratory that complements field-based
measurements acquired with the same handheld device, linking resource
exploration and processing steps in the supply chain for lithium-based battery
materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在空间的安全过滤器，能够根据用户指定的安全约束在运行时动态调整。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法假设安全约束固定，限制了适应性。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中展示了运行时适应能力，且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够灵活适应任意安全约束，提升了安全控制的适应性。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space
of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for
hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is
known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety
filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose
constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified
safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by
conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a
latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned
in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely
the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety
filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any
image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling
runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware
experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show
that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of
user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance. Video

Conclusion: ASP通过显式场景表示和功能推理，有效提升了机器人执行开放词汇指令的能力。

Abstract: Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics.
While recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models
(VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when
faced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an
explicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and
the world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this
work, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that
leverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying
capabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable
language-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a
zero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case
of more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs
on tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level
queries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene
representation. (Project page:

TL;DR: CLF-RL方法结合非线性控制理论和强化学习，设计了一种稳定且动态的人形机器人控制器，无需手动调整奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计高动态行为的控制器（如跑步）对非线性混合动力学系统具有挑战性，传统方法难以实现实时控制。

Method: 将控制Lyapunov函数（CLFs）和动态参考轨迹嵌入强化学习训练过程，以引导学习并提供稳定性保证。

Result: 生成的策略在跑步机和户外环境中表现稳健，能抵抗干扰并实现精确的全局跟踪。

Conclusion: CLF-RL为动态运动控制提供了一种有效方法，为全自主系统集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Achieving highly dynamic behaviors on humanoid robots, such as running,
requires controllers that are both robust and precise, and hence difficult to
design. Classical control methods offer valuable insight into how such systems
can stabilize themselves, but synthesizing real-time controllers for nonlinear
and hybrid dynamics remains challenging. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)
has gained popularity for locomotion control due to its ability to handle these
complex dynamics. In this work, we embed ideas from nonlinear control theory,
specifically control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), along with optimized dynamic
reference trajectories into the reinforcement learning training process to
shape the reward. This approach, CLF-RL, eliminates the need to handcraft and
tune heuristic reward terms, while simultaneously encouraging certifiable
stability and providing meaningful intermediate rewards to guide learning. By
grounding policy learning in dynamically feasible trajectories, we expand the
robot's dynamic capabilities and enable running that includes both flight and
single support phases. The resulting policy operates reliably on a treadmill
and in outdoor environments, demonstrating robustness to disturbances applied
to the torso and feet. Moreover, it achieves accurate global reference tracking
utilizing only on-board sensors, making a critical step toward integrating
these dynamic motions into a full autonomy stack.

Result: 在物体检索和区域分类任务中表现优异，且内存高效。

Conclusion: 该方法在仿真和真实环境中均有效，适用于多种机器人任务。

Abstract: Outdoor intelligent autonomous robotic operation relies on a sufficiently
expressive map of the environment. Classical geometric mapping methods retain
essential structural environment information, but lack a semantic understanding
and organization to allow high-level robotic reasoning. 3D scene graphs (3DSGs)
address this limitation by integrating geometric, topological, and semantic
relationships into a multi-level graph-based map. Outdoor autonomous operations
commonly rely on terrain information either due to task-dependence or the
traversability of the robotic platform. We propose a novel approach that
combines indoor 3DSG techniques with standard outdoor geometric mapping and
terrain-aware reasoning, producing terrain-aware place nodes and hierarchically
organized regions for outdoor environments. Our method generates a
task-agnostic metric-semantic sparse map and constructs a 3DSG from this map
for downstream planning tasks, all while remaining lightweight for autonomous
robotic operation. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates our 3DSG method
performs on par with state-of-the-art camera-based 3DSG methods in object
retrieval and surpasses them in region classification while remaining memory
efficient. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse robotic tasks of object
retrieval and region monitoring in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: SPACE2TIME为离线学习的安全过滤器在未知扰动环境中的适应性部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical
environments such as urban air mobility hinges on ensuring reliable,
performant, and safe operation under varying environmental conditions. One such
approach, value function-based safety filters, minimally modifies a nominal
controller to ensure safety. Recent advances leverage offline learned value
functions to scale these safety filters to high-dimensional systems. However,
these methods assume detailed priors on all possible sources of model mismatch,
in the form of disturbances in the environment -- information that is rarely
available in real world settings. Even in well-mapped environments like urban
canyons or industrial sites, drones encounter complex, spatially-varying
disturbances arising from payload-drone interaction, turbulent airflow, and
other environmental factors. We introduce SPACE2TIME, which enables safe and
adaptive deployment of offline-learned safety filters under unknown,
spatially-varying disturbances. The key idea is to reparameterize spatial
variations in disturbance as temporal variations, enabling the use of
precomputed value functions during online operation. We validate SPACE2TIME on
a quadcopter through extensive simulations and hardware experiments,
demonstrating significant improvement over baselines.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，PS-PRM在静态和动态环境中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PS-PRM有效提升了高自由度机器人在动态环境中的运动规划和感知任务性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of planning robot motions for a
high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot that effectively achieves a given perception
task while the robot and the perception target move in a dynamic environment.
Achieving navigation and perception tasks simultaneously is challenging, as
these objectives often impose conflicting requirements. Existing methods that
compute motion under perception constraints fail to account for obstacles, are
designed for low-DoF robots, or rely on simplified models of perception.
Furthermore, in dynamic real-world environments, robots must replan and react
quickly to changes and directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g.,
object detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This
problem is especially important in human-centered environments such as homes
and hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable
operation. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-parallelized
perception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate
model (PS-PRM). The planner explicitly incorporates the estimated quality of a
perception task into motion planning for high-DoF robots. Our method uses a
learned model to approximate perception scores and leverages GPU parallelism to
enable efficient online replanning in dynamic settings. We demonstrate that our
planner, evaluated on high-DoF robots, outperforms baseline methods in both
static and dynamic environments in both simulation and real-robot experiments.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up
end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant
domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between
human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a
unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces
between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of
discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal
Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align
between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant
information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant
absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented
cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual

Abstract: Autonomous racing has seen significant advancements, driven by competitions
such as the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) and the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing

restricting opportunities for real-world validation. While previous work
typically requires extended development cycles and significant track time, this
paper introduces a minimalistic autonomous racing stack for high-speed
time-trial racing that emphasizes rapid deployment and efficient system
integration with minimal on-track testing. The proposed stack was validated on
real speedways, achieving a top speed of 206 km/h within just 11 hours'
practice run on the track with 325 km in total. Additionally, we present the
system performance analysis, including tracking accuracy, vehicle dynamics, and
safety considerations, offering insights for teams seeking to rapidly develop

Conclusion: SSM作为ICIL的高效可扩展骨干具有潜力。

Abstract: In-context imitation learning (ICIL) enables robots to learn tasks from
prompts consisting of just a handful of demonstrations. By eliminating the need
for parameter updates at deployment time, this paradigm supports few-shot
adaptation to novel tasks. However, recent ICIL methods rely on Transformers,
which have computational limitations and tend to underperform when handling
longer prompts than those seen during training. In this work, we introduce
RoboSSM, a scalable recipe for in-context imitation learning based on
state-space models (SSM). Specifically, RoboSSM replaces Transformers with
Longhorn -- a state-of-the-art SSM that provides linear-time inference and
strong extrapolation capabilities, making it well-suited for long-context
prompts. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark and compare it
against strong Transformer-based ICIL baselines. Experiments show that RoboSSM
extrapolates effectively to varying numbers of in-context demonstrations,
yields high performance on unseen tasks, and remains robust in long-horizon
scenarios. These results highlight the potential of SSMs as an efficient and
scalable backbone for ICIL. Our code is available at

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control methods often struggle in complex non-convex
landscapes, frequently becoming trapped in local optima due to their inability
to learn from historical trajectory data. This paper introduces
Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory, a unified mathematical framework that
integrates historical experience into stochastic optimal control. Our approach
dynamically constructs memory-based potential fields that identify and encode
key topological features of the state space, enabling controllers to
automatically learn from past experiences and adapt their optimization
strategy. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that memory-augmented
potential fields possess non-convex escape properties, asymptotic convergence
characteristics, and computational efficiency. We implement this theoretical
framework in a Memory-Augmented Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
controller that demonstrates significantly improved performance in challenging
non-convex environments. The framework represents a generalizable approach to
experience-based learning within control systems (especially robotic dynamics),
enhancing their ability to navigate complex state spaces without requiring
specialized domain knowledge or extensive offline training.

Result: 构建了已验证的GMP参考库，并在仿真和硬件实验中提高了安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不重新训练的情况下，显著提升了GMPs的安全性，适用于多种规划器和场景。

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based
generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages
over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of
their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale
only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve
GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate
the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural
tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This
yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the
controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a
library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that
imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving
safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including
diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in
simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware
(differential-drive robot).

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are
not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance
Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting
feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a
framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with
cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force
Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space
behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise
scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then
passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping
parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task
axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were
collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using
teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples,
the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational
accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and
autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller
achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30
success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any
peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the
Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision
Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an
important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical
interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks involving cutting deformable objects remain
challenging due to complex topological behaviors, difficulties in perceiving
dense object states, and the lack of efficient evaluation methods for cutting
outcomes. In this paper, we introduce TopoCut, a comprehensive benchmark for
multi-step robotic cutting tasks that integrates a cutting environment and
generalized policy learning. TopoCut is built upon three core components: (1)
We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment based on a particle-based
elastoplastic solver with compliant von Mises constitutive models, augmented by
a novel damage-driven topology discovery mechanism that enables accurate
tracking of multiple cutting pieces. (2) We develop a comprehensive reward
design that integrates the topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral
reward model based on Laplace-Beltrami eigenanalysis, facilitating consistent
and robust assessment of cutting quality. (3) We propose an integrated policy
learning pipeline, where a dynamics-informed perception module predicts
topological evolution and produces particle-wise, topology-aware embeddings to
support PDDP (Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy) for
goal-conditioned policy learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TopoCut supports trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation,
and strong generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and
cutting goals.

*Naveed D. Riaziat,Joseph Chen,Axel Krieger,Jeremy D. Brown*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ThERMO是一种通过热成像反馈智能控制工具速度的自主电外科技术，旨在减少热损伤并平衡切割力，相比恒定速度方法显著提高了切割成功率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电外科手术虽能减少切割力和出血，但存在热损伤风险，且缺乏量化参考来优化切割速度。恒定速度方法无法适应组织特性、功率设置或工具类型的变化。

Method: ThERMO利用热成像反馈信息，通过优化算法智能控制工具速度，以平衡切割力和减少热损伤。

Result: 在组织模型实验中，ThERMO的切割成功率提高了三倍，峰值切割力降低了一半，并能适应环境变化，避免严重失败。

Conclusion: ThERMO通过智能速度控制显著提升了电外科手术的安全性和效率，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Electrosurgery is a surgical technique that can improve tissue cutting by
reducing cutting force and bleeding. However, electrosurgery adds a risk of
thermal injury to surrounding tissue. Expert surgeons estimate desirable
cutting velocities based on experience but have no quantifiable reference to
indicate if a particular velocity is optimal. Furthermore, prior demonstrations
of autonomous electrosurgery have primarily used constant tool velocity, which
is not robust to changes in electrosurgical tissue characteristics, power
settings, or tool type. Thermal imaging feedback provides information that can
be used to reduce thermal injury while balancing cutting force by controlling
tool velocity. We introduce Thermography for Electrosurgical Rate Modulation
via Optimization (ThERMO) to autonomously reduce thermal injury while balancing
cutting force by intelligently controlling tool velocity. We demonstrate ThERMO
in tissue phantoms and compare its performance to the constant velocity
approach. Overall, ThERMO improves cut success rate by a factor of three and
can reduce peak cutting force by a factor of two. ThERMO responds to varying
environmental disturbances, reduces damage to tissue, and completes cutting
tasks that would otherwise result in catastrophic failure for the constant
velocity approach.

*Kyo Kutsuzawa,Mitsuhiro Hayashibe*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种同时估计接触位置和工具形状的方法，使用网格表示工具形状，并通过粒子滤波器避免高维参数空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 接触状态估计对于执行装配和物体操作任务至关重要，现有方法大多需要已知工具几何形状或耗时较长。

Method: 使用网格表示工具形状，通过粒子滤波器同时估计接触位置和工具形状。

Result: 在模拟和实验中验证了方法的有效性，能够同时准确估计工具形状和接触位置。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了接触位置估计的准确性，适用于高维工具形状。

Abstract: Estimating the contact state between a grasped tool and the environment is
essential for performing contact tasks such as assembly and object
manipulation. Force signals are valuable for estimating the contact state, as
they can be utilized even when the contact location is obscured by the tool.
Previous studies proposed methods for estimating contact positions using
force/torque signals; however, most methods require the geometry of the tool
surface to be known. Although several studies have proposed methods that do not
require the tool shape, these methods require considerable time for estimation
or are limited to tools with low-dimensional shape parameters. Here, we propose
a method for simultaneously estimating the contact position and tool shape,
where the tool shape is represented by a grid, which is high-dimensional (more
than 1000 dimensional). The proposed method uses a particle filter in which
each particle has individual tool shape parameters, thereby to avoid directly
handling a high-dimensional parameter space. The proposed method is evaluated
through simulations and experiments using tools with curved shapes on a plane.
Consequently, the proposed method can estimate the shape of the tool
simultaneously with the contact positions, making the contact-position
estimation more accurate.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的轨迹参数化方法，将非凸碰撞自由走廊中的轨迹表示为凸球集的笛卡尔积，从而解耦问题规模与几何复杂性，并避免显式时间分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于走廊的规划器在复杂环境中扩展性差且需要显式分配时间窗口，因此需要更高效的轨迹规划方法。

Method: 引入新的轨迹参数化方法，并基于此提出Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP)凸优化问题，开发高效求解器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂环境中生成更平滑的轨迹且运行时间更短。

Conclusion: 新方法在复杂环境中优于现有基于走廊的规划器。

Abstract: Planning collision free trajectories in complex environments remains a core
challenge in robotics. Existing corridor based planners which rely on
decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with
environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to
trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that
represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a
convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple
problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids
explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside
ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the
Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with
separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel
structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient
optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show
that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than
state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的扩散策略优化算法，用于生成高质量、低方差的轨迹，以支持VLA模型的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型依赖大规模人工演示数据的局限性，以及传统RL算法在长时程稀疏奖励任务中的不足。

Method: 采用改进的扩散策略优化算法，结合扩散模型的高表达能力和迭代去噪过程的隐式正则化。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，生成的轨迹比人类演示和标准高斯RL策略更平滑、更一致，VLA模型的平均成功率提升至81.9%。

Conclusion: 扩散RL是一种有效的替代方法，可为VLA模型生成丰富、高质量、低方差的演示数据。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization across
tasks and embodiments; however, their reliance on large-scale human
demonstrations limits their scalability owing to the cost and effort of manual
data collection. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to
generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often
struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper,
we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate
high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion
RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high
expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but
also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield
smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO
benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that
the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human
demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training
a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average
success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by
+5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight
our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant,
high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.

TL;DR: DynaFlow是一个将可微分模拟器嵌入流匹配模型的新框架，通过生成动作空间轨迹并映射到动态可行的状态轨迹，确保物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从仅状态演示中生成物理一致轨迹并推断底层动作序列的问题，以弥合运动学数据与实际执行之间的差距。

Method: 通过可微分模拟器生成动作轨迹并映射到状态轨迹，实现端到端可微分训练。

Result: 在Go1四足机器人上成功复现多样步态、执行长时程运动，并将不可行运动学演示转化为可执行行为。

Conclusion: DynaFlow能够从仅状态演示生成可部署的高效动作，有效连接运动学数据与实际硬件执行。

Abstract: This paper introduces DynaFlow, a novel framework that embeds a
differentiable simulator directly into a flow matching model. By generating
trajectories in the action space and mapping them to dynamically feasible state
trajectories via the simulator, DynaFlow ensures all outputs are physically
consistent by construction. This end-to-end differentiable architecture enables
training on state-only demonstrations, allowing the model to simultaneously
generate physically consistent state trajectories while inferring the
underlying action sequences required to produce them. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through quantitative evaluations and showcase its
real-world applicability by deploying the generated actions onto a physical Go1
quadruped robot. The robot successfully reproduces diverse gait present in the
dataset, executes long-horizon motions in open-loop control and translates
infeasible kinematic demonstrations into dynamically executable, stylistic
behaviors. These hardware experiments validate that DynaFlow produces
deployable, highly effective motions on real-world hardware from state-only
demonstrations, effectively bridging the gap between kinematic data and
real-world execution.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注静态场景，缺乏对半静态环境中对象变化的持续跟踪，而这对实际机器人应用至关重要。

Method: 系统通过构建对象实例静态性的概率模型，系统跟踪半静态变化，并主动探索未访问区域，同时利用LLM进行开放词汇目标导航。

Result: 系统平均检测到95%的地图变化，效率提升29%，导航任务完成速度快14%，地图精度接近完全重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在半静态环境中显著提升了地图一致性和导航效率，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only
navigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment
changes. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic
map that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing
research on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without
persistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however,
crucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment
can be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this
gap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static
environments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic
model of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static
changes, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a
prolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach
leverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for
open-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more
efficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our
approach across multiple real-world semi-static environments. Our system
detects 95% of map changes on average, improving efficiency by more than 29% as
compared to random and patrol baselines. Overall, our approach achieves a
mapping precision within 2% of a fully rebuilt map while requiring
substantially less exploration and further completes object goal navigation
tasks about 14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage
patrolling). A video of our work can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段机器人操作任务中，视觉相似的观察可能对应不同动作，需要解决状态模糊问题。

Method: SAGE将任务建模为HMDP，包含状态转移网络和状态感知动作策略，结合主动学习和软标签插值减少标注需求。

Result: 在复杂任务中，SAGE实现了100%任务成功率，仅需13%状态标注即可保持性能。

Conclusion: SAGE通过显式建模任务阶段和半自动标注，高效解决了状态模糊问题。

Abstract: Multi-stage sequential (MSS) robotic manipulation tasks are prevalent and
crucial in robotics. They often involve state ambiguity, where visually similar
observations correspond to different actions. We present SAGE, a state-aware
guided imitation learning framework that models tasks as a Hidden Markov
Decision Process (HMDP) to explicitly capture latent task stages and resolve
ambiguity. We instantiate the HMDP with a state transition network that infers
hidden states, and a state-aware action policy that conditions on both
observations and hidden states to produce actions, thereby enabling
disambiguation across task stages. To reduce manual annotation effort, we
propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline combining active learning and soft
label interpolation. In real-world experiments across multiple complex MSS
tasks with state ambiguity, SAGE achieved 100% task success under the standard
evaluation protocol, markedly surpassing the baselines. Ablation studies
further show that such performance can be maintained with manual labeling for
only about 13% of the states, indicating its strong effectiveness.

Abstract: Achieving diverse and stable dexterous grasping for general and deformable
objects remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, due to high-dimensional
action spaces and uncertainty in perception. In this paper, we present D3Grasp,
a multimodal perception-guided reinforcement learning framework designed to
enable Diverse and Deformable Dexterous Grasping. We firstly introduce a
unified multimodal representation that integrates visual and tactile perception
to robustly grasp common objects with diverse properties. Second, we propose an
asymmetric reinforcement learning architecture that exploits privileged
information during training while preserving deployment realism, enhancing both
generalization and sample efficiency. Third, we meticulously design a training
strategy to synthesize contact-rich, penetration-free, and kinematically
feasible grasps with enhanced adaptability to deformable and contact-sensitive
objects. Extensive evaluations confirm that D3Grasp delivers highly robust
performance across large-scale and diverse object categories, and substantially
advances the state of the art in dexterous grasping for deformable and
compliant objects, even under perceptual uncertainty and real-world
disturbances. D3Grasp achieves an average success rate of 95.1% in real-world
trials,outperforming prior methods on both rigid and deformable objects
benchmarks.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in structured and complex indoor environments remains

synergistically combines global graph inference with diffusion-based

that integrates both observed environmental data and predictions of unexplored
areas, enhanced by a region-level evaluation mechanism to prioritize reliable
structural inferences while discounting uncertain predictions. Building upon
this enriched representation, a diffusion policy network generates stable,
foresighted action sequences with significantly reduced denoising steps.
Extensive simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GUIDE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 18.3% faster

Conclusion: RT-V2为多样化辅助技术提供了一种原则性和可推广的共享控制方法。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic shared-control solution for navigation, called
Robot Trajectron V2 (RT-V2), that enables accurate intent prediction and safe,
effective assistance in human-robot interaction. RT-V2 jointly models a user's
long-term behavioral patterns and their noisy, low-dimensional control signals
by combining a prior intent model with a posterior update that accounts for
real-time user input and environmental context. The prior captures the
multimodal and history-dependent nature of user intent using recurrent neural
networks and conditional variational autoencoders, while the posterior
integrates this with uncertain user commands to infer desired actions. We
conduct extensive experiments to validate RT-V2 across synthetic benchmarks,
human-computer interaction studies with keyboard input, and brain-machine
interface experiments with non-human primates. Results show that RT-V2
outperforms the state of the art in intent estimation, provides safe and
efficient navigation support, and adequately balances user autonomy with
assistive intervention. By unifying probabilistic modeling, reinforcement
learning, and safe optimization, RT-V2 offers a principled and generalizable
approach to shared control for diverse assistive technologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist robot manipulation leverage pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large-scale robot demonstrations to tackle
diverse tasks in a zero-shot manner. A key challenge remains: scaling
high-quality, action-labeled robot demonstration data, which existing methods
rely on for robustness and generalization. To address this, we propose a method
that benefits from videos without action labels - featuring humans and/or
robots in action - enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling
data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D
point clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics
predictor for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action
predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that
our method not only learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations -
improving downstream generalist robot policies - but also enables robots to
learn new tasks without action labels (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in
both real-world and simulated settings.

Result: 相比直接应用RL的次优结果，新方法提供了鲁棒且高效的疏散策略。

Conclusion: 新方法在复杂场景下表现出色，适用于如机器人引导人群疏散等实际应用。

Abstract: Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge
across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms,
and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control
strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of
scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the
need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves
controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents
tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy
for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces
acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader
we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to
the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large
groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a
straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced
architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation
strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at:

Abstract: This paper presents a lidar-only state estimation and tracking framework,
along with a roadside sensing unit for integration with existing urban
infrastructure. Urban deployments demand scalable, real-time tracking
solutions, yet traditional remote sensing remains costly and computationally
intensive, especially under perceptually degraded conditions. Our sensor node
couples a single lidar with an edge computing unit and runs a computationally
efficient, GPU-free observer that simultaneously estimates object state, class,
dimensions, and existence probability. The pipeline performs: (i) state updates
via an extended Kalman filter, (ii) dimension estimation using a 1D
grid-map/Bayesian update, (iii) class updates via a lookup table driven by the
most probable footprint, and (iv) existence estimation from track age and
bounding-box consistency. Experiments in dynamic urban-like scenes with diverse
traffic participants demonstrate real-time performance and high precision: The
complete end-to-end pipeline finishes within \SI{100}{\milli\second} for
\SI{99.88}{\%} of messages, with an excellent detection rate. Robustness is
further confirmed under simulated wind and sensor vibration. These results
indicate that reliable, real-time roadside tracking is feasible on CPU-only
edge hardware, enabling scalable, privacy-friendly deployments within existing
city infrastructure. The framework integrates with existing poles, traffic
lights, and buildings, reducing deployment costs and simplifying large-scale
urban rollouts and maintenance efforts.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers for quadrupedal locomotion have
demonstrated impressive performance on challenging terrains, allowing robots to
execute complex skills such as climbing, running, and jumping. However,
existing blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and
efficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly
complex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select
appropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing
perception-based controllers still present several practical limitations,
including a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing
resource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering
Risky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to
dynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks.
During the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by
selectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass,
friction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable
directly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed
three foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds.
More importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce
the drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one
LiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy. The
experimental results indicate that MARG maintains stability in various risky
terrain tasks.

Abstract: We present LLM Trainer, a fully automated pipeline that leverages the world
knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform a small number of human
demonstrations (as few as one) into a large robot dataset for imitation
learning. Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1)
offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and
pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those
keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified
keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new
trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is
saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson
sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success
rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data
annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We
further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward
plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller. Finally, we
demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot. For additional

TL;DR: 3D QSR框架结合几何、视觉和语义信息，实现机器人对复杂3D环境的理解和任务规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人理解高级人类指令和复杂任务时，场景理解的挑战。

Method: 提出3D QSR框架，融合三种3D表示（新视角渲染、点云几何、场景图），结合视觉语言模型实现语义查询。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中验证了框架的有效性，支持机器人任务规划。

Conclusion: 3D QSR能有效整合空间和语义推理，将人类指令转化为精确的机器人任务规划。

Abstract: To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform
complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene
understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a
meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric
structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we
introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework
built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:
(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic
reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,
scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,
the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic
queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting
object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The
retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream
execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning
scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the
indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate
of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for
emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to
facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning,
effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task
planning in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 现有TSDF/ESDF方法多依赖GPU加速，而本方法旨在仅用CPU实现高效映射。

Method: 采用方向性位掩码集成方案，将LiDAR点云数据增量融合到体素网格中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CPU上实现了与当代技术相当的精度和速度。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需GPU的情况下，实现了高效且高分辨率的3D重建。

Abstract: This paper presents a high-efficiency, CPU-only volumetric mapping framework
based on a Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). The system incrementally
fuses raw LiDAR point-cloud data into a voxel grid using a directional
bitmask-based integration scheme, producing dense and consistent TSDF
representations suitable for real-time 3D reconstruction. A key feature of the
approach is that the processing time per point-cloud remains constant,
regardless of the voxel grid resolution, enabling high resolution mapping
without sacrificing runtime performance. In contrast to most recent TSDF/ESDF
methods that rely on GPU acceleration, our method operates entirely on CPU,
achieving competitive results in speed. Experiments on real-world open datasets
demonstrate that the generated maps attain accuracy on par with contemporary
mapping techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a control methodology for achieving orbital stabilization
with simultaneous time synchronization of periodic trajectories in
underactuated robotic systems. The proposed approach extends the classical
transverse linearization framework to explicitly incorporate
time-desynchronization dynamics. To stabilize the resulting extended transverse
dynamics, we employ a combination of time-varying LQR and sliding-mode control.
The theoretical results are validated experimentally through the implementation
of both centralized and decentralized control strategies on a group of six
Butterfly robots.

Method: 使用五阶多项式表示连续轨迹，结合神经ESDF进行直接优化，采用两阶段非线性优化流程平衡效率、安全性和平滑性。

Result: 实验表明，C-3TO能生成碰撞感知且动态可行的轨迹，且通过灵活调整参数适应不同需求。

Conclusion: C-3TO为无人机局部重规划提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for continuous 3D trajectory
optimization in cluttered environments, leveraging online neural Euclidean
Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs). Unlike prior approaches that rely on
discretized ESDF grids with interpolation, our method directly optimizes smooth
trajectories represented by fifth-order polynomials over a continuous neural
ESDF, ensuring precise gradient information throughout the entire trajectory.
The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that
balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate
that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories.
Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization
parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without
compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization
with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and
generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial
robotics.

Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid safety verification framework for closed-loop

approach augments control barrier functions with a novel $\psi$-weighted
formulation that encodes directional control alignment between agents into the
safety constraints. Deterministic admissibility is combined with empirical
validation via Monte Carlo rollouts, and a PAC-style guarantee is derived based
on margin-aware safety violations to provide a probabilistic safety
certificate. The results from the experiments conducted under different bounded
stochastic disturbances validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法受限于模仿学习的物理规则编码不足，依赖复杂后处理或计算昂贵的梯度计算。

Method: 离散化驾驶空间构建动作码本，利用预训练扩散语言模型，通过安全感知反射机制进行迭代自校正。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ReflectDrive在安全关键轨迹生成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ReflectDrive为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 解决刚性尾的高风险与软性尾的低性能之间的权衡问题。

Result: 尾角速度达670°/s，力和扭矩显著提升200%。

Conclusion: BVSR尾在多种应用中表现出高性能和实用性。

Abstract: Robotic tails can enhance the stability and maneuverability of mobile robots,
but current designs face a trade-off between the power of rigid systems and the
safety of soft ones. Rigid tails generate large inertial effects but pose risks
in unstructured environments, while soft tails lack sufficient speed and force.
We present a Biomimetic Vertebraic Soft Robotic (BVSR) tail that resolves this
challenge through a compliant pneumatic body reinforced by a passively jointed
vertebral column inspired by musculoskeletal structures. This hybrid design
decouples load-bearing and actuation, enabling high-pressure actuation (up to 6
bar) for superior dynamics while preserving compliance. A dedicated kinematic
and dynamic model incorporating vertebral constraints is developed and
validated experimentally. The BVSR tail achieves angular velocities above
670{\deg}/s and generates inertial forces and torques up to 5.58 N and 1.21 Nm,
indicating over 200% improvement compared to non-vertebraic designs.
Demonstrations on rapid cart stabilization, obstacle negotiation, high-speed
steering, and quadruped integration confirm its versatility and practical
utility for agile robotic platforms.

Conclusion: 该路线图为机库规划者提供了平衡精度、覆盖范围和预算的方法，有望推动智能机库的发展。

Abstract: The accuracy, resilience, and affordability of localisation are fundamental
to autonomous robotic inspection within aircraft maintenance and overhaul (MRO)
hangars. Hangars typically feature tall ceilings and are often made of
materials such as metal. Due to its nature, it is considered a GPS-denied
environment, with extensive multipath effects and stringent operational
constraints that collectively create a uniquely challenging environment. This
persistent gap highlights the need for domain-specific comparative studies,
including rigorous cost, accuracy, and integration assessments, to inform a
reliable and scalable deployment of a localisation system in the Smart Hangar.
This paper presents the first techno-economic roadmap that benchmarks motion
capture (MoCap), ultra-wideband (UWB), and a ceiling-mounted camera network
across three operational scenarios: robot localisation, asset tracking, and
surface defect detection within a 40x50 m hangar bay. A dual-layer optimisation
for camera selection and positioning framework is introduced, which couples
market-based camera-lens selection with an optimisation solver, producing
camera layouts that minimise hardware while meeting accuracy targets. The
roadmap equips MRO planners with an actionable method to balance accuracy,
coverage, and budget, demonstrating that an optimised vision architecture has
the potential to unlock robust and cost-effective sensing for next-generation
Smart Hangars.

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中达到新SOTA，展示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AnchDrive通过锚点引导扩散策略，高效生成高质量轨迹，适用于复杂驾驶场景。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in
autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the
generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a
framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy
to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models.
Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a
rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two
complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set
of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in
real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features.
The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a
distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This
anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse,
high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that
AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆运动学方法在冗余人形机械臂上过于关注末端执行器跟踪，导致配置机械有效但不自然。HL-IK旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用大规模人类运动数据训练FiSTA网络预测肘部姿态，并将其作为残差项整合到Levenberg-Marquardt优化器中。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，HL-IK显著降低了手臂相似性误差，提升了动作的人性化程度。

Conclusion: HL-IK简单易集成，能有效生成更自然的机器人动作。

Abstract: Traditional IK methods for redundant humanoid manipulators emphasize
end-effector (EE) tracking, frequently producing configurations that are valid
mechanically but not human-like. We present Human-Like Inverse Kinematics
(HL-IK), a lightweight IK framework that preserves EE tracking while shaping
whole-arm configurations to appear human-like, without full-body sensing at
runtime. The key idea is a learned elbow prior: using large-scale human motion
data retargeted to the robot, we train a FiLM-modulated spatio-temporal
attention network (FiSTA) to predict the next-step elbow pose from the EE
target and a short history of EE-elbow states.This prediction is incorporated
as a small residual alongside EE and smoothness terms in a standard
Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer, making HL-IK a drop-in addition to numerical IK
stacks. Over 183k simulation steps, HL-IK reduces arm-similarity position and
direction error by 30.6% and 35.4% on average, and by 42.2% and 47.4% on the
most challenging trajectories. Hardware teleoperation on a robot distinct from
simulation further confirms the gains in anthropomorphism. HL-IK is simple to
integrate, adaptable across platforms via our pipeline, and adds minimal
computation, enabling human-like motions for humanoid robots. Project page:

Result: PAD在六项真实任务中表现优于现有方法，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PAD提供了一种高效、低成本的学习双手策略的方法。

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies from expert demonstrations is an important
frontier in modern robotics research, however, most popular methods require
copious efforts for collecting teleoperation data and struggle to generalize
out-ofdistribution. Scaling data collection has been explored through
leveraging human videos, as well as demonstration augmentation techniques. The
latter approach typically requires expensive simulation rollouts and trains
policies with synthetic image data, therefore introducing a sim-to-real gap. In
parallel, alternative state representations such as keypoints have shown great
promise for category-level generalization. In this work, we bring these avenues
together in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning
generalizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on
three steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable
keypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to
augment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the
augmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy. Empirically, we
showcase that PAD outperforms state-ofthe-art bimanual demonstration
augmentation works relying on image policies with simulation rollouts, both in
terms of success rate and sample/cost efficiency. We deploy our framework in
six diverse real-world bimanual tasks such as pouring drinks, cleaning trash
and opening containers, producing one-shot policies that generalize in unseen
spatial arrangements, object instances and background distractors.

Abstract: End-to-end learning of robot control policies, structured as neural networks,
has emerged as a promising approach to robotic manipulation. To complete many
common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's
field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the
spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However,
building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research
problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D
Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based
on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation
experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where
state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our
reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in
this direction.

Conclusion: VisualMimic框架在非结构化环境中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight
integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing
approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to
generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real
framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control
for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint
tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with
a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual
and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the
low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.
VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in
simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of
loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and
kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize
robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at:
