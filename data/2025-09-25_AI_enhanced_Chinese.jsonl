The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is\nproposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet\nconfigurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new\nimages from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,\ndust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions\nwithout explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility\nimpairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A\nnew dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating\nvehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number\nof labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images\nfrom an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility.

In this work, we present a training framework for robotic\nfoundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based\nnavigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)\nbackbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric\nimages, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a\nrandomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of\nusable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,\nsemantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves\nstrong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,\nand the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate\nthat OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a\nflexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks.

The nonlinear\nresponses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of\nanalytic models for soft robot control. Traditional methods of controlling soft\nrobots underutilize their configuration spaces to avoid nonlinearity,\nhysteresis, large deformations, and the risk of actuator damage. Furthermore,\nepisodic data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) are\ntraditionally limited by sample efficiency and inconsistency across\ninitializations. In this work, we demonstrate RL for reliably learning control\npolicies for dynamic balancing tasks in real-time single-shot hardware\ndeployments. We use a deformable Stewart platform constructed using parallel,\n3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic (HSA)\nstructures. By introducing a curriculum learning approach based on expanding\nneighborhoods of a known equilibrium, we achieve reliable single-deployment\nbalancing at arbitrary coordinates. In addition to benchmarking the performance\nof model-based and model-free methods, we demonstrate that in a single\ndeployment, Maximum Diffusion RL is capable of learning dynamic balancing after\nhalf of the actuators are effectively disabled, by inducing buckling and by\nbreaking actuators with bolt cutters. Training occurs with no prior data, in as\nfast as 15 minutes, with performance nearly identical to the fully-intact\nplatform.

While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for\nhard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is\nknown a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety\nfilter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose\nconstraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified\nsafety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by\nconditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a\nlatent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned\nin a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely\nthe system may approach the constraint representation.

However, these PEFT-based\nRGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as\nprompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal\nperformance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in\nprompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier\nPrompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature\nextraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality\nFusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts\nthrough multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature\nextraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.\nThen, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency\ndomain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and\nunderstanding of modality features from different domain information.

Existing methods that\ncompute motion under perception constraints fail to account for obstacles, are\ndesigned for low-DoF robots, or rely on simplified models of perception.\nFurthermore, in dynamic real-world environments, robots must replan and react\nquickly to changes and directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g.,\nobject detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This\nproblem is especially important in human-centered environments such as homes\nand hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable\noperation. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-parallelized\nperception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate\nmodel (PS-PRM). The planner explicitly incorporates the estimated quality of a\nperception task into motion planning for high-DoF robots. Our method uses a\nlearned model to approximate perception scores and leverages GPU parallelism to\nenable efficient online replanning in dynamic settings.

By examining the\ndistribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples\npredominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift\ntoward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the\nExponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular\nexponential term as the margin.

As organ size differs\nby sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in\nlower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.\nWhile previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,\nno study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.\nThis study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC\nin an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,\naverage DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around\n0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,\nwith sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that\nfairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect\nidentical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A\nsegmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error\nmagnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work\nraises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences\nin segmentation performance.

Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a\nmainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally\nface the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,\nhindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a\nlight-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR\nreconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the\nContext-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the\nYCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then\nemploys an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress\nghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce\nInverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced\nMulti-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at\nmultiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main\nversion for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in\ncomputational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between\nperformance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared\nto the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and\nincreases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge\ndevice.

Open-Vocabulary Semantic Exploration in Real-World Semi-Static Environments", "comment": null, "summary": "Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only\nnavigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment\nchanges. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic\nmap that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing\nresearch on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without\npersistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however,\ncrucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment\ncan be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this\ngap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static\nenvironments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic\nmodel of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static\nchanges, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a\nprolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach\nleverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for\nopen-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more\nefficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our\napproach across multiple real-world semi-static environments.

Most recent decomposition methods\nsegment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called\nsuperpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment\nstandard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without\ndistortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called\nSphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide\n360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of\nthe 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path\nbetween a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering\nfeatures.

Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown\nadvanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we\nunderscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise\nknowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge\ncoherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across\nclients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt\nclass-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During\nprompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge\nconflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,\nintensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method\nthat explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt\ncommunication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism\n(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across\nclients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency.

The primary contribution of this study is a feature\nmatching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate\nintermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive\nviewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are\nreconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to\ntheir large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for\nscene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For\naccurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed\nby using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate\nhigh-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and\nground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature\nmatching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground\nimages, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences\nthrough intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the\nvalidation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature\nmatching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used\nmethods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can\nprovide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious\nincrease in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide\nenough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based\nscene rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u56fe\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89d2\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u822a\u7a7a\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5f0fSfM\u91cd\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u91c7\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8fdb\u884c\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e32\u67d3\u89c6\u89d2\u786e\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5339\u914d\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684ISfM\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u76843DGS\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u822a\u7a7a\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting\nmethods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based\ndiffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing\nregions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing\ndirectly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring\nspatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for\ntime-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly\nrepetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities\nwithin the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for\nstructural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.\nPractically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch\nmeasurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,\nsubsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in\n3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective\nsubstitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct\nextensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and\nthe results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.\nAdditional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of\nthe proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single\nmodality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability\nto capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a\nsingle reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic\nchanges in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we\nintroduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion\nembedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and\naudio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal\nfeatures), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more\nauthentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion\nand accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)\nmodule that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,\nSynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model\n(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and\nhigh-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and\ntextual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa\noutperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,\nexpression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that\nSynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in\noverall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

Using these modified\nkeypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new\ntrajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is\nsaved.

To address this, we\nintroduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework\nbuilt on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:\n(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic\nreconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,\nscalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,\nthe framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic\nqueryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting\nobject-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The\nretrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream\nexecution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning\nscenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the\nindoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate\nof a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for\nemergency response.

However, these methods remain constrained by the\nlimitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode\nphysical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex\nrule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely\nlimited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires\ncomputationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a\nreflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We\nfirst discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action\ncodebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for\nplanning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware\nreflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient\ncomputation.

We\nhypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic\nperformance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,\noffer readily available complementary information by summarizing\nhistopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical\ncontext. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their\nheterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several\nbillion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of\nvarying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we\npropose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which\nare then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival\nprediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).\nSpecifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,\nleveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and\nstandardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly\nrepresent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway\nprototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular\nfunctions.

Scaling data collection has been explored through\nleveraging human videos, as well as demonstration augmentation techniques. The\nlatter approach typically requires expensive simulation rollouts and trains\npolicies with synthetic image data, therefore introducing a sim-to-real gap. In\nparallel, alternative state representations such as keypoints have shown great\npromise for category-level generalization. In this work, we bring these avenues\ntogether in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning\ngeneralizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on\nthree steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable\nkeypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to\naugment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the\naugmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy. Empirically, we\nshowcase that PAD outperforms state-ofthe-art bimanual demonstration\naugmentation works relying on image policies with simulation rollouts, both in\nterms of success rate and sample/cost efficiency. We deploy our framework in\nsix diverse real-world bimanual tasks such as pouring drinks, cleaning trash\nand opening containers, producing one-shot policies that generalize in unseen\nspatial arrangements, object instances and background distractors.\nSupplementary material can be found in the project webpage\nhttps://gtziafas.github.io/PAD_project/.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0cPAD\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PAD\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a\u89e3\u6790\u89c6\u9891\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u6f14\u793a\u3001\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PAD\u5728\u516d\u9879\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "PAD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u53cc\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy\nimages in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and\npropose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed\nDiffLI$^2$D.

Building on this, we\npresent PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted\nheuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are\niteratively refined to guide prompt construction.

This is partly due to the lack of controlled,\nground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,\nsuch as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced\ncontrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light\npatterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance\nof ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and\nseasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific\noptical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack\ngeneralizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is\ntechnically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \\textit{Optical\nOcean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled\nunderwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,\nusing calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and\ncontrolled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.\nHence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in\nrealistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios.

Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains\nvulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve\nmisleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing\nattacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily\ntarget vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD\nsystems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)\nAdversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital\nlevel. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various\nVLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics).

In clinical practice, CT images are usually\nacquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage\nand operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower\ninter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent\nresolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based\nvolumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice\nresolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the\nthrough-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,\nthe anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT\nslice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.\nSpecifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane\ntexture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution\nthrough-plane images.

Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and\nPSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with\nparticular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show\ncomplementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around\nregime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a\ncalibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate\nsystems.

But the progress\nin this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the\nlack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field\ndeployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study\npresents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models\nfor deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of\nthis work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available\ndataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,\nderived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO\narchitectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a\nhigh-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing\nplatforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.

Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and\nthe high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches\nhave garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection\nremains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of\nreconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,\nignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus\nfailing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose\nStrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the\noptimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the\ntime series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture\nsuch structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape\nin the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent\nstructural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time\nseries.

Since only a subset of the\nclients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent\nto fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of\nresearchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL\nframeworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed\nfairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV\nenvironment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework\nto ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL\ntraining process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module\nwithin the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair\ncollaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.\nThe selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling\nthe clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier\ndetection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the\nmodel performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or\nloss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily\nsuspend such clients from participating in the FL training process.

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint\nand latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference\nscenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its\nimportance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs\ncomplicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that\ntransform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with\nfewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first\nderive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized\nweights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit\nquantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to\nachieve near-optimal quantization performance.

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions.

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates\nin antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high\nbioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,\ncomputational models specifically designed to predict associations between\noligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a\nprompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover\npotential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,\nmicrobes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic\ninformation. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a\nprompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful\npaired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global\nfeatures. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a\nbenchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy.

In contrast to classical generalization\ntheory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and\noutputs, but the evolution of internal features.
