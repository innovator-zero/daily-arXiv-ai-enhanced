In this paper, we propose\nthe theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents\nto generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We\nfurther propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized\ntraining of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized\nexecution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with\ndecentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow\ntraining is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of\n(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of\nreasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide\ntheoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with\nprobability proportional to the reward function.

This process is computationally intensive and\nincreases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly\nmethod for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over\nsignals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a\ndirect quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high\nuncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.\nTo test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements\nderived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and\nuse it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that\nNTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and\nsimple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.\nFurthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding\nonly the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection\nperformance.

Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle\nthe high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder\nthat simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within\nlocalized {\\em patches} of individual channels.

Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from\nphysical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to\nit being too heavy.

This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it\nlimits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it\nmakes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both\nchallenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating\ncomplex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to\ngrasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies\nthe sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a\nparadigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design\nof novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \\textbf{S}uction\n\\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated\nfingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By\nreplacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our\ndesign fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the\ncollection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this\nsuction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are\ndifficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper\ncutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond\nanthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier\nfor collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,\nsingle-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.\nOur webpage is https://sites.google.com/view/sleaphand.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08SLeap Hand\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5c16\u5438\u76d8\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u529b\u95ed\u5408\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7075\u5de7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eff\u4eba\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u529b\u95ed\u5408\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6307\u5c16\u5438\u76d8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5438\u9644\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u5355\u624b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a81\u7834\u4eff\u4eba\u9650\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u95e8\u69db\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Abstract abridged due to arXiv's 1920\n  character limit", "summary": "Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to\nvariable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and\nimaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these\nchallenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the\nreal-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical\nscenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model\nselection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of\nadvanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)\n(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,\nconsisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for\nblueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with\nsmartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled\ninstances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide\nrange of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the\nYOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while\nRT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR\nvariants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and\nthe mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To\nfurther enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using\nUnbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of\n1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in\n2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with\nRT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%.

Early risk stratification can benefit\nfrom machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their\ngeneralizability on an external cohort.\n  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and\n(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,\nstandardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training\nfolds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and\nfrozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination\n(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation\nused the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics\non PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.\n  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC\n~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947).

In this context, shared control refers\nto a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous\ndriving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced\ndriving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling\nlimits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle\navoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on\nskill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term\nskill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or\nemploys other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this\ngap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic\nshared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers\nacquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an\nautonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a\nhighly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism\nalong with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from\nautonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two\nbenchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance\nduring training.

This formulation unifies prior approaches under a\nreward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce\nnon-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference\ninefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward\nFine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing\ntrajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,\na naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data\nfidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a\nlayer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally\nlocalized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based\nregularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional\ndistillation-based methods.

However, due to the lack of\ndistinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are\nhighly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A\nfundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the\ninherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute\ntargets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often\nleading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods\noften rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,\nwhich are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast\nand high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that\nexplicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic\nmodeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a\nBidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and\nGlobal Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature\ndependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer\narchitecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual\ninformation, ensuring robust scene understanding.

Latent Twins provide a\ncompact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across\narbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with\nscientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty\nquantification.

To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was\ncreated from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that\ncollects millions of plant image queries all over the world.

Prior art\ntypically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.\nHowever, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each\nyear. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent\ncounting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,\nwe argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,\nfrom what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily\nobjects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with\ntime and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than\ncounting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and\nopen-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants.

This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame\ngeneration approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar\nframes, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To\naddress this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves\ntext-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation\non a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model\nto fill the intermediate frames.

In\nthis paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that\nminimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting\napproximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by\napproximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid\nfunctions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full\nretraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)\nthat identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder\nallocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework\nthat continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via\ngradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art\nupdatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that\nSig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,\nand uses up to 1000x less memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sig2Model\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002Sig2Model\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1aSigmoid\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "Sig2Model\u5c06\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e20\u500d\uff0cQPS\u63d0\u53473\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c111000\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Sig2Model\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further\ndemonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping\noptimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more\nfaithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.\nThese insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its\nconnection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled\napproaches to perceptual optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u3002\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u8d77\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u548cIQA\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5728IQA\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u8d77\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8epatch-level\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cIQA\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u5316\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

While existing\nmethods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,\nleading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this\npaper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class\nproportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and\n(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks\ntarget. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free\nRobustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and\ndistribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a\nrobustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the\nless robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the\ndistribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness\ndistillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a\nuniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the\ndominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced\nrepresentation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target\nAdversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class\nconstraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack\ntargets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable\ncategories.

Specifically, our framework first converts\nBOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,\ncapturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.\nSubsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate\nclass-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD\nsignals via inverse Fourier transforms.

Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,\nmost existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In\nthis study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial\nstates through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose\nthe concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's\ncompetitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly\nshaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error\nbound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a\nfine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training\ncontroller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a\nprincipled proxy for ECS.

However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths\n(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited\nsupervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data\nheterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training\nefficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited\nsupervision.

It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature\nsequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving\ndata heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes\ndiscarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with\ntailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature\nloss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to\ncompress features in both branches to reduce redundancy.

In\nthis work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move\nbeyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable\nexternal dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a\ngeneralizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual\nNon-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the\nprevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to\nlearn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand\nmotion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and\nmorphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer\ndirectly to robotic end-effectors.

We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs.

We\ndemonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and\ntask type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but\nrequire large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical\nefficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral\npatterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and\ndefault to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.\nOur findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies\nbased on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in\nhttps://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86StyleBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165StyleBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c\uff08CoT\u3001ToT\u3001AoT\u3001SoT\u3001CoD\uff09\u572815\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u4f46\u9700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b80\u6d01\u98ce\u683c\u5728\u660e\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We employ crime incident data obtained from each\ncity's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American\nCommunity Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to\n2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.\nmiles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a\nConvolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime\noccurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences.

PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by\nreplacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned\nprediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show\nlimited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce\nDecoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the\nfunction space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the\npredictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes\nsimilarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.\nThus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining\nkernel-free.

While previous\nwork has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been\npaid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect\nthe reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first\nconcept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision\nmodels trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific\nvision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a \"dissector,\" our approach labels\nneurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and\nquantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we\ninvestigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL\nvision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific\ndatasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept\nspecialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain\nunderrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more\nclinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'\nworkflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for\ntask-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories\n(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,\ndensity-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and\ngeneralisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights\ninto how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific\nknowledge.

Recently, skeleton-based methods have\ngained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in\nsubjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental\nfactors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak\nsemantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from\nskeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance\nbetween local details and global context, with models either focusing too\nnarrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)\ninefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned\nrepresentations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we\npropose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a\nsign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between\nvisual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic\ncontext; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises\nagreements across different levels of paired features from different\nmodalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level\nsemantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines\ncontrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic\nconsistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on\nisolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and\ngloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different\nsign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative\npre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution\nfor SLU.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sigma\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u624b\u8bed\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u5f31\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u8bed\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u5f31\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSigma\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Sigma\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9aa8\u67b6\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Their prohibitive computational and memory costs\nseverely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has\nbecome a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we\nempirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing\nbillion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed\nactivation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes\ncalibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first\nQuantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two\ntechnical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained\nQuantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local\nchannel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel\nvariance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which\nfilters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse\ncalibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results\nacross different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin.

This work\nrevisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We\nempirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse\nvariant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and\nwe complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory\nside, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA\nfeatures: for both $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ threat models (binary and\nmulticlass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\\top u$ shrink,\nwhere $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for\ngeneral (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a\nLipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.\nEmpirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA\nconsistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and\nblack-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,\nthe theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial\nleverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the\nlinear setting.

Further,\nMoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves\nthis with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and\nnone of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple\nlatent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step\ntoward broader multi-LLM collaboration.

Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on\nreconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective\nmismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often\nmisinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false\nnegatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\n\\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new\npre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning\nto reconstruct inputs, \\texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify\nanomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.\nThis relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,\nenables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that\nreconstruction-based methods often miss.

In\nthis work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on\noffloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips\nand traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate\nrevisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present\nSuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses\nHopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.\nSuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as\nadaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware\ncasting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace\nCPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x\nthroughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,\nenabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high\ntraining throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data\nparallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of\n13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while\nachieving 55% MFU.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperOffload\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316Superchip\u67b6\u6784\uff08GPU-CPU\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff09\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "Superchip\u67b6\u6784\u4e3aAI\u786c\u4ef6\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5378\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSuperOffload\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u5378\u8f7d\u3001\u5206\u6876\u91cd\u7ec4\u3001Superchip\u611f\u77e5\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316Hopper GPU\u3001Grace CPU\u548cNVLink-C2C\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA GH200\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02.5\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u82af\u7247\u8bad\u7ec325B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c8\u82af\u7247\u8bad\u7ec313B\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8fbe100\u4e07token\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperOffload\u4e3aSuperchip\u67b6\u6784\u7684LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, in practice, models often\nget updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,\ninvalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will\nnot lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses\nthis issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is\nresilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse.

To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models.
