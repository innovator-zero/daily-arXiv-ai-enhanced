The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain\nconsistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions.

In\nresponse to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling\nAttack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic\ncomponents of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:\nfirstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe\nprompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that\ncan bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that\ntrigger filters.

To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a\nnovel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon\nManipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural\nrepresentation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging\ntask-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also\nfacilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE\nconsists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses\nVLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded\nscene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing\npipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a\ncorresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive\nexperiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance\non distinct long-horizon tasks."}

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based\nmethods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient\nand accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing\nICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which\nmay cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence\nof an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic\nenvironments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR\nodometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed\ncoarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the\ninitial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by\ncomparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error\nbetween the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the\ncurrent and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted\nto accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based\non the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane\nadaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,\nachieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.\nExtensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy\nof LiDAR odometry."}

To\ninform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative\nto understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially\nfor traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the\nsensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can\nmeasure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration\nresistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the\nlocomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in\nmeasurements.

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features.

Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity.

To address this issue, we propose\nRoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically\nquantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor\nisolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a\nperceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that\nenable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and\ntheir interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three\nrepresentative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three\nkey findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera\nviewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest\nsuccess rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual\npreferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,\nasymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.\nFinally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic\ngrounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\\% on\nMOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a\nprerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents."}

The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated\nacross diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)\napplied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an\nembarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random\nMask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features\nfrom data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our\nlinear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA\nsequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard\nand more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for\nstate-of-the-art models.

As a result, they fail to address the issue\nof false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically\nsimilar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard\nnegatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning\nstrategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for\nmodeling how spatial correlation changes with distance.

Current\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language\ntasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such\nas variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage\nvariations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs\nincorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,\nTask-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding\nweights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via\ninternal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature\nrecalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during\nbackpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only\nleverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical\nparameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also\nintroduces randomness to stabilize the selection.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.\nOur approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a\ncaption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal\nimplicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the\noriginal image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we\nedit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics\nand pushing them away from hallucination directions.

Through tokenization,\nencoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as\nguidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to\ninject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding\nphase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and\nprototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow\nMatching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on\nwell-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,\ndemonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both\nunimodal and multimodal scenarios."}

In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to\nidentify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement\neffective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose $\\textbf{G}$roup $\\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\\textbf{P}$olicy\n$\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy\noptimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based\nAR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\\textbf{(1)}$ Causal\ndependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final\nimage effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced\nspatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image\nstructure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused\ntoken diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled\nimages contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified\ncritical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to\nencourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model\nand reference model.

In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single\nH100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal\nquality loss."}

We introduce\nCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that\nredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should\nenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the\ncorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM\ngenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a\nseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on\nthat caption.

Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the\nvast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these\narchitectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective\ntoken merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless\ncompatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly\nconflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution\nacross the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure\npost-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce\nstructured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains\nrelative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token\nrepresentation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong\nperformance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.\nSpecifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop\nevaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1\naccuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning."}

We address this\nwith Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a\nlightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and\ntask-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.\n  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes\nby 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving\npath planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across\nthree robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard\nCP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it\nachieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage.

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning.
