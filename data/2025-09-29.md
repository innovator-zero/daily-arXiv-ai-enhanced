### [1] [Random Direct Preference Optimization for Radiography Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21351)
*Valentin Samokhin,Boris Shirokikh,Mikhail Goncharov,Dmitriy Umerenkov,Maksim Bobrin,Ivan Oseledets,Dmitry Dylov,Mikhail Belyaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机对比采样的模型无关框架，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）提升放射学报告生成（RRG）的准确性，无需额外数据即可提升临床指标5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RRG方法在真实临床环境中的质量不足，而大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在通用领域表现优异，启发利用类似LLM的训练策略（如对齐技术）改进RRG。

Method: 采用随机对比采样构建训练对，结合直接偏好优化（DPO），无需奖励模型或人工偏好标注。

Result: 在三个先进模型上补充随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 随机DPO是一种高效且无需额外数据的RRG优化方法，适用于实际临床部署。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态分析方法，通过改进视线特征描述符，提升了自闭症谱系障碍（ASC）的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自闭症诊断复杂且资源密集，现有计算机辅助方法在视线特征和泛化能力上表现不佳，因此需要更有效的多模态分析方法。

Method: 使用标准化视频数据集（168名ASC患者和157名非自闭症参与者），分析面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和视线行为，并引入新的统计描述符改进视线模型。

Result: 视线分类准确率从64%提升至69%，多模态融合后整体准确率达到74%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，多模态行为标记的整合可支持可扩展的视频筛查工具，提升自闭症评估效果。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一种模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高效用上下文，解决VLA模型推理效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在长时推理中因注意力二次成本和KV内存无限增长而受限，现有方法忽视推理效率。

Method: 将KV缓存分块，通过循环门控模块按效用分数筛选历史上下文，保留细节并修剪低相关内存。

Result: 理论提升1.21倍推理速度，减少36% KV内存，任务成功率影响小。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA无缝集成现有VLA架构，实现高效推理且无需修改训练流程。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语的事实检查模型（FC模型），用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的胸部X光报告存在事实错误和幻觉，阻碍了其临床应用。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置生成合成数据集，并训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络。

Result: 模型在多个X光数据集上表现出高准确性和定位能力，与基于真实数据的验证一致性达0.997。

Conclusion: 该模型在临床推理中具有实用性，可用于检测报告生成器的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过融合细粒度图像特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升了视网膜疾病分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM难以捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的低层空间细节，如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变等。

Method: 结合U-Net编码器的跳跃特征与LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块，采用多深度融合方法。

Result: MDF-MLLM在双类型疾病分类任务中准确率达94%，比基线模型提升56%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为视网膜图像分类提供了可推广、可解释的框架，未来将探索同步训练技术和扩展至分割任务。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPDA利用图像模态分离不安全提示的语义成分，通过伪安全提示和自然对抗提示绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的越狱方法难以绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，且图像输入的潜在漏洞未被充分探索。

Method: 1. LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示；2. LLM重写有害提示为自然对抗提示；3. 视觉语言模型生成图像标题以确保语义一致性。

Result: MPDA成功绕过安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: MPDA为T2I模型的越狱攻击提供了新的多模态方法，揭示了图像输入的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测的多任务学习方法，通过相互学习模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决显著目标检测中预测不完整和边界不准确的问题。

Method: 利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务相互监督，并开发了相互学习模块（MLM）。

Result: 在七个数据集上实现了显著目标检测和边缘检测的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和相互学习模块有效提升了显著目标检测和边缘检测的性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore是一种新的多模态相关性评估指标，适用于三种及以上模态，通过多模态联合表示实现公平评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标仅适用于双模态分析，限制了多模态相似性评估的需求。

Method: 提出MAJORScore，利用多模态联合表示将多种模态整合到同一潜在空间。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore是大规模多模态数据集和模型性能评估的更可靠指标。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用AI和数字化技术提升脚手架安全检查的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架检查依赖人工视觉，耗时且易出错，需改进以提高安全性。

Method: 开发基于云的AI平台，通过点云数据对比检测结构变化。

Result: 系统能自动监测脚手架，减少人工检查时间和错误。

Conclusion: AI技术可提升施工现场安全性，实现高效自动化检查。

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

### [10] [Automated Prompt Generation for Creative and Counterfactual Text-to-image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21375)
*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸的图像，通过图像评估器、提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器优化提示，显著提升了生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成在细粒度控制上存在挑战，尤其是反事实控制（如生成与常识矛盾的图像），这对创造性和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 提出一个包含图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练排序器的框架，构建首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集，并改进Grounded SAM以提升评估效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有基线模型和ChatGPT-4o，图像评估器性能提升114%。

Conclusion: 该研究为反事实控制性提供了基础，推动了未来相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了一种经济高效的超分辨率光学显微镜方法，利用非荧光相位调制显微技术和深度学习网络（O-Net和Theta-Net），在不同信噪比条件下互补提升图像分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学显微镜的分辨率限制（约200nm）通常需要昂贵设备或特殊技术（如荧光超分辨率显微镜），本研究旨在为非专业用户提供一种经济替代方案。

Method: 使用Zernike相位对比（PCM）和微分干涉对比（DIC）显微技术，结合两种深度学习网络（O-Net和Theta-Net）对纳米级测试目标进行超分辨率重建。

Result: O-Net在高信噪比（SNR）下表现更优，而Theta-Net在低SNR下更有效，两者为互补而非竞争关系。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型架构与源图像信噪比的结合对非荧光光学纳米镜的超分辨率图像质量至关重要。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMTF-AVN提出了一种动态多目标融合方法，用于高效音频-视觉导航，通过Transformer机制优化跨模态信息融合，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音频-视觉导航中未能充分利用多模态信息的深层感知上下文，导致导航效果受限。

Method: 采用多目标架构和优化的Transformer机制，动态筛选和融合跨模态信息。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上，DMTF-AVN在成功率、路径效率和场景适应性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMTF-AVN展示了强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的多模态融合策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统概念标记实现一对一概念-神经元映射，显著提升概念遗忘效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘时，概念表示可能分散在多个潜在特征中，导致搜索过程复杂。

Method: 引入SAEmnesia，通过监督训练促进一对一概念-神经元映射，减少特征分裂并集中特征表示。

Result: 在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，SAEmnesia比现有方法提升9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过集中概念表示显著提升了概念遗忘的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

TL;DR: 提出了一种智能轻量级的核心集选择方法，通过提取类内多样性形成聚类，用于最终采样，优于随机采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型训练和超参数搜索需要大量计算资源，核心集选择是解决这一问题的潜在方案，但随机采样存在代表性不足的问题。

Method: 提出一种方法，通过提取类内多样性形成每类聚类，用于最终采样。

Result: 在生物医学图像数据集上，该方法在多个性能指标上优于随机采样。

Conclusion: 智能核心集选择方法能有效提升模型训练效率，同时保持数据集的代表性。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常仅使用单次或有限次数的乳腺X光片，且未针对现实世界中不平衡结果分布和异质性随访进行优化。

Method: LongiMam结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，捕捉空间和时间模式，训练和评估基于大规模人群筛查数据。

Conclusion: 纵向建模可提升乳腺癌预测，支持在筛查项目中重复使用乳腺X光片以优化风险分层。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了CNN在复杂社会认知任务中与人类大脑的对应关系，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，并提出了Object2Brain框架分析不同对象类别对相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CNN与人类大脑在复杂社会认知任务（如图像情感评估）中的对应关系，填补现有研究在高级脑处理方面的空白。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为及fMRI数据的对齐程度，并开发Object2Brain框架结合GradCAM和对象检测技术。

Result: CNN在图像情感评估任务中难以反映高级脑处理，且不同架构对对象类别的敏感性不同。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂社会认知任务中的表现有限，Object2Brain框架为研究CNN与人类大脑的对应关系提供了新工具。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDebug框架通过移除和重新训练步骤，帮助概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）减少对不良概念的依赖，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CBM与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，避免模型从偏见数据中学习捷径。

Method: 提出两步骤框架：1. 移除不良概念；2. 使用CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转化为样本级辅助标签，进行监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CBDebug框架有效减少模型对不良概念的依赖，提升模型与专家推理的一致性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder是一个开源的QGIS插件，用于从多波束声纳数据中自动检测沉船，通过深度学习和合成数据生成提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海事历史的重要标记，但传统的手动检测方法耗时且需要专家分析，因此需要自动化工具。

Method: 工具结合深度学习模型，预处理测深数据并生成分割掩码或边界框，同时利用合成数据增强数据集。

Result: 与ArcGIS工具包和传统方法相比，ShipwreckFinder在分割性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder为沉船检测提供了高效的开源解决方案，适用于历史研究和海洋勘探。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究表明，轻到中度剪枝可以提升显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留语义明确的概念；而过度剪枝会降低解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨剪枝对模型可解释性的影响，包括显著性图和概念表示的变化。

Method: 使用ResNet-18在ImageNette上训练，通过VG和IG方法评估剪枝后的解释性，并应用CRAFT提取概念。

Result: 轻到中度剪枝提升解释性，过度剪枝损害概念一致性和显著性图稀疏性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以优化模型内部表示，但需避免过度剪枝以保持可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的限制，适用于更常见的视觉数据。

Method: 使用轻量级稀疏卷积主干和两个专用头（3D物体检测和布局估计），采用新颖的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个场景理解基准测试中达到最优性能，布局估计表现突出。

Conclusion: TUN3D在室内场景理解中实现了新的综合性能标准。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能影响关键内容的重建质量。

Method: 系统将图像分割为关键和非关键区域，分别使用图像导向语义编码器和图像到文本建模方法处理，并采用轻量级部署策略（模型量化和低秩适应微调）。

Result: 仿真结果表明，系统在语义保真度和视觉质量上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架化尺度空间的方法，通过稀疏化中轴实现形状的层次简化，解决了传统中轴对噪声敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中轴（medial axis）作为形状描述符对噪声敏感，传统修剪方法无法满足尺度空间的关键性质。

Method: 引入骨架化尺度空间，结合稀疏化和逆过程（densification），实现层次简化和过完备形状表示。

Result: 实验证明该方法在骨架提取、形状压缩和增材制造中具有有效性。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了一种理论严谨且实用的形状简化框架。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Motivation: 高分辨率气候预测对地方决策至关重要，但现有预测空间分辨率低（如12.5公里），限制了其可用性。

Method: 在缺乏高分辨率气候预测训练数据的情况下，使用高分辨率观测网格数据集训练模型，并将其应用于低分辨率气候预测。通过气候指标评估降尺度效果。

Result: 实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能在不增加气候指标误差的情况下降尺度气候预测。

Conclusion: 该方法为高分辨率气候预测提供了一种可行解决方案，无需依赖高分辨率训练数据。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型（VLMs）可能被滥用或存在安全对齐问题，尤其是图像扰动攻击，因此需要研究更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 提出JaiLIP方法，结合干净图像与对抗图像的均方误差损失和模型有害输出损失，生成对抗图像。

Result: 实验表明，JaiLIP生成的对抗图像在毒性指标上优于现有方法，且在特定领域（如交通）中具有实用性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了图像越狱攻击的实际挑战，并呼吁开发高效的VLM防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Result: 深度学习模型的性能已接近最先进的人类专家水平。

Conclusion: 自动化系统在生物识别领域已具备与人类专家竞争的能力。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Conclusion: QuadGPT为原生四边形网格生成设立了新基准，展示了自回归模型与拓扑感知强化学习结合的优势。

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

<details>

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型可能无意中复制受版权保护的风格和视觉概念，引发法律和伦理问题。现有擦除方法无法扩展到多概念或冲突概念的场景。

Method: DyME训练轻量级、特定概念的LoRA适配器，并在推理时动态组合所需适配器。通过特征和参数层次的双层正交约束，减少适配器间的干扰。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上，DyME在多概念擦除保真度和最小副作用方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态模块化设计解决了多概念擦除的挑战，为实际应用提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的3B和7B规模的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），在多个基准测试中表现优于更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE等）无法捕捉人类判断的细微差别，而人工评估成本高昂。

Method: 通过生成器与评估器的交互训练VideoJudge，生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃。

Result: VideoJudge-7B在四个基准测试中的三个表现优于更大的基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL），且MLLM法官优于纯LLM法官。

Conclusion: 视频输入对视频理解任务的评估至关重要，长链推理并不能提升性能。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知需要高效的信息共享，但通信带宽限制了其扩展性。

Method: ReVQom结合瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化（RVQ），压缩特征维度并仅传输像素代码索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上，ReVQom实现了273x至1365x的压缩，且在18 bpp时性能优于原始特征。

Conclusion: ReVQom为多智能体协同感知提供了高效且准确的解决方案，推动了V2X的实际部署。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前文本生成图像AI模型在描绘沙特阿拉伯职业时存在显著的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，尤其是DALL-E V3表现最严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型在生成职业图像时如何反映性别和文化偏见，特别是在沙特阿拉伯的背景下。

Method: 通过分析三个AI模型生成的1,006张图像，由沙特注释者评估性别、服装、背景等维度。

Result: 所有模型均显示性别失衡（男性占比高），且文化不准确性普遍存在。

Conclusion: 需更多样化的训练数据和公平算法以减少偏见，确保视觉输出的公平性和真实性。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的预训练方法，用于统一检测短视频中的不当内容，通过三种任务提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每种不当内容单独训练小模型，缺乏跨问题泛化能力且依赖大量人工标注数据。

Method: 引入三种预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、CoT（提升推理能力）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调中的性能，并展现出对未见问题的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的预训练范式有效解决了短视频内容与原始数据分布差异及复杂问题定义，为不当内容检测提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位任务重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过视觉反馈和强化学习提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标预测方法在高分辨率复杂布局GUI中表现不佳，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 采用多步在线强化学习，结合视觉反馈和轨迹奖励函数训练模型。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上分别提升至93.9%和56.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: GUI-Cursor模型通过交互式搜索显著提升GUI定位性能，并能自适应调整步骤。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: X-CoT提出了一种基于LLM CoT推理的可解释检索框架，替代传统嵌入模型，提升检索性能并提供详细解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本-视频检索系统中低质量数据对和缺乏解释性的问题。

Method: 通过扩展基准数据集和设计检索CoT（逐步比较）来实现可解释的检索。

Result: X-CoT提高了检索性能，并支持模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT为文本-视频检索提供了可解释的解决方案，同时改善了数据质量和模型分析能力。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动检查手术器械缺陷容易出错，现有自动化方法在手术领域效果不佳，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 结合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效域适应，专门优化手术器械缺陷检测。

Result: 方法能可靠检测手术器械图像中的细微缺陷，克服了误检和灵敏度不足问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为手术器械缺陷检测提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性可分性（LSEP）的替代正则化方法，用于训练扩散模型，无需依赖外部编码器，直接提升训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型预训练编码器进行表示对齐，计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过促进中间层表示的线性可分性（LSEP）作为正则化方法，直接融入网络学习动态，无需外部编码器。

Result: 在基于流的Transformer架构（如SiTs）上，训练效率和生成质量显著提升，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上FID达到1.46。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了表示对齐，简化了训练流程并提升了性能。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，导致难以区分视觉相似但地理距离远的图像对（困难负样本）以及视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本的图像对（假负样本）。

Method: 提出了一种空间正则化对比学习策略，利用半变异函数建模特征空间距离与地理距离的关系，定义视觉差异参考以识别困难负样本和假负样本。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上验证了该方法，表明显式建模空间先验提高了图像地理定位性能，尤其是在更细粒度上。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间相关性建模，该方法显著提升了图像地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Result: X-Streamer在两块A100 GPU上实时运行，支持从任意肖像生成长时间一致的视频聊天体验。

Conclusion: X-Streamer为交互式数字人类的统一世界建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Motivation: 现有视频生成器难以从单张图像预测物体运动，尤其是在简单物理场景中，因为它们专注于生成像素而非直接建模运动。

Method: 采用条件生成密集轨迹网格的模型，架构类似现代视频生成器，但输出运动轨迹而非像素。

Result: 在模拟数据和真实世界物理数据集上表现优异，下游应用（如机器人）中效果显著。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动而非生成像素能更有效地解决单图像运动预测问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Result: DINOv3在聚类和静态动作识别上表现更优，而V-JEPA2在所有动作类型中表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为视频分析系统的架构选择提供了实证指导，需根据任务需求和可靠性约束选择合适的方法。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Result: VLCE在InfoMetIC上达到95.33%的评分，语义对齐表现优异，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VLCE展示了自动化生成灾害图像详细描述的潜力，可提升灾害评估效率。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Conclusion: 视觉模型的表示结构由架构和训练目标共同塑造，超越了表面设计类别，SNF为模型分类提供了生物学启发的框架。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。

Method: 引入可训练的几何分支，通过跨分支监督（几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测）实现联合建模。

Conclusion: 该框架有效连接了视频想象与3D感知，统一主干和跨分支信息交换是其性能提升的关键。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4

backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

### [46] [Motion-Aware Transformer for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21715)
*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR是一种基于Transformer的多目标跟踪方法，通过预测物体运动减少查询冲突，显著提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DETR框架中检测和跟踪查询冲突导致关联精度下降的问题。

Method: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，显式预测物体运动并提前更新跟踪查询。

Result: 在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BDD100k数据集上取得显著性能提升，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 显式建模运动是提升多目标跟踪性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

*Shuning Sun,Jialang Lu,Xiang Chen,Jichao Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空Lie群微分偏差直接注入网络注意力分数中，解决了现有方法计算成本高且鲁棒性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外拍摄的视频常受雨痕、模糊和噪声影响，且相机姿态的微小变化会加剧跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算昂贵且不够鲁棒。

Method: DeLiVR引入两个互补组件：旋转有界的Lie相对偏差预测帧内角度，以及微分群位移计算相邻帧间角度差异以估计速度。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，DeLiVR表现出色。

Conclusion: DeLiVR通过Lie群表示连续几何变换，有效提升了视频去雨的空间和时间一致性。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

TL;DR: DynaNav是一个动态视觉导航框架，通过自适应特征和层选择提升效率与可解释性，显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型计算开销高且缺乏可解释性，限制了在资源紧张场景中的应用。

Method: 提出DynaNav框架，结合可训练硬特征选择器和贝叶斯优化的早期退出机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上，DynaNav显著降低FLOPs、推理时间和内存使用，同时提升导航性能。

Conclusion: DynaNav为资源受限场景提供高效、可解释的视觉导航解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across
four public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自然图像领域基础模型成功的启发，探索其在SAR领域的应用潜力，以解决数据稀缺和分布偏移问题。

Method: 测试现有视觉基础模型（如DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core）的局限性，并通过自监督微调SAR数据改进模型性能。

Result: 微调后的AFRL-DINOv2模型显著优于现有SAR模型SARATR-X，并在不同下游任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 自监督微调是SAR基础模型的有效路径，但仍需进一步研究以完全发挥其潜力。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for
robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for
video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model
with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法动态模拟移动界面，提升UI测试和AI训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态分析，难以应对动态多样的移动环境，限制了UI测试和智能代理的发展。

Method: UISim采用两阶段方法：预测下一UI状态的抽象布局，并基于布局合成视觉一致的图像。

Result: 实验表明，UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态上优于端到端基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、原型设计和AI代理训练提供了高效工具，展现了其潜力。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Result: 实验表明MesaTask在生成符合任务描述的桌面场景上优于基线方法，且布局更真实。

Conclusion: MesaTask通过空间推理链和LLM框架有效解决了任务与场景之间的鸿沟，为机器人任务训练提供了高质量的场景数据。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation

LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of
83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%,

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的新框架，以提升群体情感识别（GER）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息的重要性，且忽略了情感标签的语义信息。

Method: 框架包含视觉上下文编码模块和情感语义编码模块，通过相似性感知交互整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的GER数据集上表现出色，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架通过整合视觉与语义信息，显著提升了GER的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 双隐式神经记忆为VLN研究开辟了新方向，展示了隐式记忆的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Conclusion: KG-SAM是一个鲁棒且通用的医学图像分割框架，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型需要针对不同任务进行预训练，成本高且难以扩展。UniVid探索预训练视频生成模型是否能适应多样化的视觉任务。

Method: UniVid通过微调视频扩散变换器，将任务表示为视觉句子，上下文序列定义任务和输出模态。

Result: UniVid在跨模态和跨源任务中表现良好，无需多源预训练。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型可作为视觉建模的统一基础，具有扩展性和灵活性。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，兼容空间架构，实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token合并方法无法保持空间架构依赖的空间结构，限制了其在现代ViT中的应用。

Method: 采用2D缩减策略、空间感知合并算法和最大幅度维度token表示，兼顾信息分布和空间结构。

Result: 在SAM-H和DeiT-B上分别实现1.25倍和1.15倍加速，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: 该方法在空间和非空间架构中均表现优异，为token合并提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Result: 在四种伪造类型上超越基线方法，无需对LVLM进行微调。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过任务感知知识注入和跨样本关系建模，有效提升了多模态深度伪造检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Result: 在跨图像推理任务中达到64.82%的准确率，超越之前最佳方法1%。

Conclusion: MIRG-RL在多图像推理和定位任务中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Result: 实验表明，LongScape能稳定生成长时视频，保持视觉质量和一致性。

Conclusion: LongScape为高质量长时视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中，MoWM实现了最先进的任务成功率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoWM为具身规划研究提供了有价值的见解，展示了混合特征空间的优势。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

TL;DR: DiTraj是一种无需训练的方法，用于在基于DiT的视频生成中实现轨迹控制，通过前景-背景分离和修改位置嵌入提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法资源消耗大或仅适用于U-Net，未能利用DiT的优越性能，因此提出DiTraj以解决这些问题。

Method: 使用LLM分离前景和背景提示，提出STD-RoPE修改前景令牌的位置嵌入以增强轨迹控制。

Result: 实验表明，DiTraj在视频质量和轨迹可控性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT视频生成提供了一种高效、可控的轨迹控制方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成方法为零样本多跳问答提供了实用解决方案，平衡了准确性、效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HDR-4DGS的方法，用于解决动态高动态范围新视角合成（HDR DNVS）问题，通过动态色调映射模块实现时空辐射一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对静态场景，忽略了动态元素（如移动物体和光照变化），因此需要一种能够联合建模时空辐射变化的方法。

Method: 提出HDR-4DGS，基于高斯泼溅架构，引入动态色调映射模块，动态调整色调映射函数以适应辐射分布的变化。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度上均优于现有方法，实现了时空辐射一致性和准确的色彩转换。

Conclusion: HDR-4DGS能够从任意视角和时间点生成逼真的HDR渲染，解决了动态场景的挑战。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高分辨率多视图图像，难以在低分辨率图像上泛化，且多视图超分辨率方法不适用于可变形手部。

Method: 提出几何感知隐式图像函数（GIIF），联合优化隐式图像函数和显式3D手部形状，保持多视图和姿态一致性。

Result: 在InterHand2.6M和Goliath数据集上，SRHand在定量和定性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRHand通过结合隐式和显式表示，实现了从低分辨率图像的高质量3D手部重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及和易用性引发了社会担忧，但当前研究过于关注‘假图像’，忽略了‘真实图像’的定义和技术演变。

Method: 通过分析现有‘假图像’检测方法的依赖数据集和技术背景，指出其局限性。

Result: 提出需要重新定义‘真实图像’，并呼吁建立新的基准数据集。

Conclusion: 论文旨在引发对‘假图像’检测研究方向的讨论，强调明确‘真实图像’技术定义的重要性。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在美学评估中表现潜力，但缺乏数据和主观性限制了其准确性和解释性。

Method: 提出AesCoT管道构建高质量推理数据，并设计RAPO算法联合优化评分和排序。

Result: 实验显示Aes-R1显著提升性能（PLCC/SRCC分别提高47.9%/34.8%），优于同类基线。

Conclusion: Aes-R1在有限监督和分布外场景下表现鲁棒，统一了美学评分与推理。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: StableDub通过创新设计提升了视觉配音任务的性能，扩展了其实际应用范围。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Conclusion: Drag4D通过统一架构实现了高质量3D场景中用户控制的物体运动，具有高效性和一致性。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Motivation: 现有音频到视频模型在精细同步方面表现不佳，音频作为时间线索可以改进视频生成的时间控制。

Method: 基于预训练视频模型，引入运动感知损失和音频同步引导，提升同步性和视觉质量。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上，Syncphony在同步准确性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过改进同步机制，实现了高质量的音频到视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言引导的遥感变化检测模型（LG-CD），通过结合文本提示和多模态信息，显著提升了检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，忽略了多模态数据（如文本）提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型（SAM2）提取多尺度特征，通过多层适配器微调，设计文本融合注意力模块（TFAM）对齐视觉与文本信息，并使用视觉-语义融合解码器（V-SFD）生成检测结果。

Result: 在三个数据集（LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LG-CD为利用多模态信息实现广义变化检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本驱动方法缺乏精确的空间控制，拖拽驱动方法无法提供细粒度纹理指导，两者互补但各有不足。

Method: 提出了基于扩散的联合框架，包括点云确定性拖拽和拖拽-文本引导去噪两项创新。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在联合编辑中表现优异，且在各单独模式下也优于专用方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为可控图像编辑提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的轻量级模型框架，利用未标注数据提升北欧地区无人机图像中车辆的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北欧地区因积雪导致的能见度问题和领域偏移，以及标注数据昂贵但未标注数据易获取的特点，促使研究利用未标注数据改进车辆检测。

Method: 通过对比学习在预训练阶段训练CNN表示提取器，并在微调阶段将其加载到冻结的YOLO11n骨干网络中，比较了多种融合方法和粒度。

Result: 在NVD数据集上，mAP50提升了3.8%至9.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效利用未标注数据，显著提升了车辆检测性能。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

TL;DR: IF-V2V是一种无需反转的方法，利用现成的流匹配I2V模型进行视频编辑，避免了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要特定模型的反转或大量优化，限制了利用最新I2V模型的能力。

Method: 通过向量场校正和样本偏差绕过反转，引入结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知噪声，并使用偏差缓存机制减少计算成本。

Result: 方法在编辑质量和一致性上优于现有方法，提供轻量级即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V为视频编辑提供高效、高质量的解决方案，支持视觉创意实现。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

TL;DR: SSLCounter是一种基于自监督学习的多视角计数方法，通过神经体积渲染减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据，SSLCounter旨在通过自监督学习解决这一问题。

Method: 利用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，重建连续几何形状和复杂视角依赖的外观。

Result: SSLCounter在性能上达到最优，且仅需70%训练数据即可实现竞争性表现。

Conclusion: SSLCounter展示了卓越的数据效率，可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在空间理解上存在不足，尤其是物体间的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用合成数据集，评估了多种视觉模型和视觉语言模型在空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务上的表现。

Result: 检测器在精确定位但有限的关系推理上表现较好，而视觉语言模型在布局提示和流畅描述上更优，但在细粒度空间上下文上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了定位与真正空间理解之间的差距，呼吁开发更具空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL通过利用多个上下文图像对减少视觉上下文学习中的偏差，无需额外训练即可提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉上下文学习（VICL）因过度依赖单一上下文对导致的预测偏差和不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习框架（PANICL），通过平滑多对上下文图像的分配分数减少偏差。

Result: 在多种任务（如分割、检测、着色等）中表现优于基线，且对领域偏移具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PANICL是一种通用且高效的训练免费框架，适用于多种VICL模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一种轻量级6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB图像，无需深度传感器或多视图采集，在资源有限环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖深度传感器或RGB图像，但在透明、反光或低光场景下性能不足。

Method: 结合token-scaler微调机制和深度感知匹配，优化Depth-Anything v2的深度预测，并改进LoFTR的匹配能力。

Result: 在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上，平均召回率提升6.1%，深度预测性能提升14.41%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D在资源受限和复杂场景下表现优异，超越现有方法。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SemanticControl方法，解决ControlNet在视觉条件与文本提示不对齐时的生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖精确对齐的视觉条件，但在不常见或想象场景中难以满足，导致生成效果不佳。

Method: 通过辅助去噪过程提取注意力掩码，自适应抑制冲突的视觉条件，增强文本引导。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种松散对齐条件下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SemanticControl有效提升了在不精确视觉条件下的生成质量。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有评估方法存在局限性，如忽略合理回答、情感分类有限、忽视上下文等，阻碍了对MLLMs情感感知能力的准确评估。

Method: 提出Emotion Statement Judgment任务和自动化流程，高效构建情感相关陈述，减少人工标注。

Result: MLLMs在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断中表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面存在局限，与人类表现仍有差距。

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架和全面评估，论文为提升MLLMs的情感智能提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Result: 实验表明MultiCrafter显著提升主体保真度并更好对齐人类偏好。

Conclusion: MultiCrafter有效解决了多主体图像生成中的关键问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Conclusion: PartSAM为3D部分理解的基础模型迈出了重要一步，代码和模型即将发布。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Result: 在三个少样本基准测试中显著优于监督微调基线，并展示出强跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理优先的方法有效提升了少样本场景下的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在空间偏差，提出平衡位置分配（BaPA）机制以提升其空间鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LVLMs对图像中关键信息位置变化的敏感性，揭示其空间语义理解的局限性。

Method: 设计探测数据集分析空间偏差，提出BaPA机制平衡位置嵌入。

Result: BaPA无需重新训练即可提升空间鲁棒性，结合轻量微调进一步优化多模态任务表现。

Conclusion: BaPA通过平衡注意力机制促进更全面的视觉理解，为LVLMs设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，从预训练扩散模型中分离视觉和语义特征，并引入VSM指标量化视觉不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型包含丰富的语义和视觉特征，但缺乏标注数据集使得视觉特征分离困难。

Method: 构建带标注的图像对，设计对比架构分离特征，提出VSM指标。

Result: 方法在量化视觉不一致性上优于CLIP、DINO等模型，并能定位不一致区域。

Conclusion: 首次实现量化与定位不一致性，为任务提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的嵌入在动态模态（如音频和视频）中的应用尚未充分探索，需要一种统一的表示空间。

Method: 采用分层特征融合策略和联合多模态多任务训练方法，支持跨模态检索和生成任务。

Conclusion: WAVE为跨模态应用提供了广泛可能性，并通过新基准推动了多功能音频-视觉学习的发展。

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型因大量视觉标记导致计算开销大，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段推理流程：先分析降采样图像识别相关区域，再裁剪高分辨率区域处理。

Result: ERGO在多个数据集上表现优于原模型和竞争方法，效率更高。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，显著提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

TL;DR: DualFocus是一种新的深度聚焦（DFF）框架，通过联合建模空间和焦距维度的焦点变化，提高了复杂场景中的深度估计准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型DFF方法在复杂场景（如细纹理或深度突变）中表现不佳，因为焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: DualFocus利用焦距堆栈中的梯度模式，引入变分公式，结合空间和焦距约束，区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，DualFocus在深度准确性和感知质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过双约束设计，显著提升了复杂场景中的深度估计性能。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏理论支持，无法有效平衡任务性能与通信量。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上，RDcomm在减少通信量108倍的同时达到最优精度。

Conclusion: RDcomm为多智能体协作感知提供了高效通信策略的理论与实践基础。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在比较T2I模型时存在局限性，无法全面诊断系统性失败或定位其根本原因，因此需要一种主动探索的补充方法。

Method: FailureAtlas通过结构化搜索最小化失败诱导概念，并采用新颖的加速技术解决计算爆炸问题。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型上，该方法发现了超过247,000个未知错误片段，并首次大规模证明这些失败与训练数据稀缺相关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas为生成AI的鲁棒性开发提供了一种新的、诊断优先的方法论。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要额外微调或手工先验，且可能牺牲信息量和可扩展性，因此提出更高效、无需训练的方法。

Method: 利用文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间，生成正负锚点，通过调整解码器隐藏状态减少幻觉。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少幻觉（如CHAIR上降低5%），且对无幻觉描述几乎无副作用。

Conclusion: 方法高效、通用性强，适用于多种架构，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余视觉输入时容易受到干扰，导致无关推理或幻觉，需要更精准的区域发现和处理能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoFFT使模型性能提升3.1-5.8%，计算开销可控。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知，有效提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Result: 在AVE和MUSIC数据集上，DAVIS的两种变体均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAVIS展示了生成模型在音频-视觉分离任务中的高效性。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Conclusion: 新方法克服了现有局限性，通过多视角信号和Mamba提升了自监督补全的质量。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决条件图像生成模型在边缘设备上部署时的高资源需求和标注数据稀缺问题，减少成本和隐私风险。

Method: 提出三层次知识融合损失和半监督蒸馏方法，结合标注和未标注数据。

Result: 显著降低计算成本和延迟，同时保持高保真生成能力和可控性。

Conclusion: Refine-Control为边缘设备上的条件图像生成提供了一种高效且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

*Jonas Belouadi,Tamy Boubekeur,Adrien Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiMat是一个多模态程序合成框架，利用大型多模态模型处理视觉和文本图表示，以改进程序材质图的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经程序合成方法仅将图表示为文本程序，未能捕捉节点图固有的视觉空间特性，MultiMat旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合大型多模态模型处理视觉和文本表示，并使用约束树搜索推理算法确保语法有效性。

Result: 实验表明，MultiMat在无条件和有条件图合成中均比纯文本基线更高效，且视觉质量和保真度更高。

Conclusion: MultiMat在多模态程序合成中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 结合StyleGAN、DragGAN和PCA提升GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，优化时间和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，实现更高效和直观的图像编辑。

Method: 集成StyleGAN的结构化潜在空间、DragGAN的图像操纵和PCA的降维与跨模型对齐。

Result: 在AFHQ数据集上，PCA结合DragGAN减少了优化时间并保持视觉质量，SSIM有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像合成和编辑提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

TL;DR: MinerU2.5是一种1.2B参数的文档解析视觉语言模型，通过两阶段解析策略实现高效且高精度的文档解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率文档解析中的计算效率与识别精度之间的平衡问题。

Method: 采用粗到细的两阶段解析策略，先进行全局布局分析，再进行局部内容识别。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: MinerU2.5在文档解析任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和高精度。

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-CoT框架通过多步推理和验证，提升了遥感视觉语言模型的复杂任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遥感任务中缺乏可验证的推理步骤，导致输出不可靠。

Method: 采用两阶段对齐策略：监督微调建立认知架构，GRPO优化推理策略。

Result: RSThinker模型在多项任务中显著优于现有技术，并提供可验证的分析轨迹。

Conclusion: Geo-CoT380k数据集和RSThinker模型推动了遥感分析从感知到可验证推理的转变。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的框架，通过预训练的2D分割模型和视觉语言模型（VLM），将2D多粒度掩码提升到3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）场景中，解决了现有方法的三大缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的逐场景训练、无法处理多概念语义且易受跨视图语义不一致影响，MUSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用2D分割模型生成多粒度掩码并提升到3D，通过语义熵和几何不透明度优化初始对象组，再通过VLM提取文本特征以实现开放词汇查询。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从几小时缩短到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割任务中优于现有训练框架。

Conclusion: MUSplat通过消除逐场景训练需求，显著提升了效率和性能，同时解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球过半人口，但现有基准缺乏对时间演变和主观感知的系统性探索。

Method: 通过空间聚类、规则生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注构建14.3K视觉问题，覆盖11个城市的街景图像。

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，接近人类专家水平，但在时间推理任务中表现下降。部分模型在主观感知维度达到或超越人类一致性。

Conclusion: UrbanFeel为MLLMs在城市环境中的能力提供了系统性评估，揭示了其在时间推理和主观感知方面的潜力与不足。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFUDA中隐私和成本问题，同时挖掘目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: 使用双专家框架（冻结源模型和视觉语言模型）和RAIN三阶段优化流程（检索、微调、一致性学习）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EXCL通过协同学习和优化流程，有效提升了SFUDA的性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: FlashEdit为实时图像编辑提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有数据集过于关注分类准确性，导致模型在高风险诊断推理中表现不佳，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了Neural-MedBench，整合多序列MRI扫描、电子健康记录和临床笔记，包含三种核心任务，并采用混合评分流程。

Result: 评估显示，先进模型在推理任务中表现显著下降，错误分析表明推理失败是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出双轴评估框架，强调广度与深度评估的结合，Neural-MedBench作为开放测试平台，促进临床可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过创新方法解决了传统和卫星方法的局限性，提升了地图构建的效率和连续性。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.

Motivation: 现有方法通常分开处理网格重建和材质分解任务，且难以处理高反射表面，依赖外部模型先验。

Method: 联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新粗糙度监督策略。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上验证，结果与最先进方法相当，提供三角形网格和材质组件。

Conclusion: GS-2M框架高效且可扩展，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Result: 强化学习在分布外数据（如图像、未见类别和不同模态）上表现更优。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有显著的泛化优势。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2V模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显，但目前对T2V模型的漏洞研究较少，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: SceneSplit通过分场景操纵生成输出空间，利用场景组合约束最终结果，并通过迭代场景操纵和策略库增强攻击效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上测试，SceneSplit在多个T2V模型上平均攻击成功率显著高于基线（Luma Ray2:77.2%，Hailuo:84.1%，Veo2:78.2%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前T2V安全机制易受叙事结构攻击，为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS是一种基于动量的采样技术，通过整合历史预测提升扩散模型的图像生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中仍有不真实和细节不足的问题，尤其是在低NFE或低引导尺度下。

Method: 提出HiGS，利用当前预测与历史预测的加权平均差异来引导采样过程。

Result: HiGS显著提升图像质量，并在30步采样下达到1.61的FID新纪录。

Conclusion: HiGS是一种即插即用的增强方法，可在不增加计算负担的情况下提升生成速度和保真度。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

TL;DR: VeloxSeg提出了一种轻量级3D医学图像分割方法，通过双流CNN-Transformer架构和模态交互，显著提升了效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决轻量级3D医学图像分割中效率和鲁棒性的冲突，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和多模态数据时的挑战。

Method: 采用双流架构（PWA和JLC），结合模态交互和空间解耦知识迁移（SDKT），增强特征提取和表示能力。

Result: 在多项基准测试中，Dice分数提升26%，GPU和CPU吞吐量分别提升11倍和48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg在保持轻量化的同时，显著提升了分割性能和计算效率，适用于多模态医学图像分析。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

TL;DR: RAPID3框架通过三重强化加速策略（Step-Skip、Cache-Reuse、Sparse-Attention）实现DiTs的零更新加速，采样速度提升近3倍且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiTs加速方法依赖统一启发式或手动设计策略，无法兼顾速度与质量；动态神经网络虽能自适应加速，但调优成本高。

Method: RAPID3通过三个轻量级策略头独立决策加速行为，利用GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时通过对抗性判别器增强奖励信号。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等DiT骨干上，RAPID3实现近3倍加速且生成质量接近原始模型。

Conclusion: RAPID3为零更新自适应加速提供了高效解决方案，平衡了速度与质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Conclusion: 多模态知识图谱显著提升了PAR任务的性能，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

Motivation: 探索MLLMs从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力，填补其在工程设计中视觉与数学推理结合的空白。

Method: 通过分层合成生成管道（包括基于网格的示意图生成器和自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器）创建基准测试，评估6种最先进的MLLMs。

Result: 闭源模型在感知任务中准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理中低于19%，显示视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 数学理解在电路合成中起基础作用，符号推理能力是工程能力的关键指标。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Result: 在COCOA和InstaOrder数据集上表现优于基线方法，支持零样本推理。

Conclusion: GPT-4通过语义、视觉和常识知识，无需训练数据即可高效处理遮挡关系。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

Result: 在四个公开数据集上优于12种先进方法，主观和客观评估均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多焦点图像融合的质量，尤其在边界细节保留方面表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法通常针对静态场景，无法适应动态输出标签空间的需求。

Method: 采用聚类替代模型训练和远标签目标攻击策略，将动态输出场景转化为静态场景。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证了TDOA的有效性，攻击成功率达50.81%，在静态场景中达82.68%。

Conclusion: TDOA在动态和静态场景中均表现出色，且可扩展至生成任务，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Result: 在脑部MRI海马体分割任务中，LTNs显著提升了基线性能，尤其在训练数据稀缺时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法具有通用性，可推广至其他医学语义分割任务，尽管目前仍处于初步阶段。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Conclusion: VARE和S-VARE为VAR模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案，解决了语言漂移和多样性降低等问题。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Result: 在多个数据集上优于基线方法，表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU展示了VLM在医学图像解剖理解中的潜力，适用于自动化临床工作流。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一种无需图像描述的通用图像修复框架，通过双分支调节器和自适应调制计划实现高质量修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在未知混合退化条件下容易过度平滑、产生幻觉或漂移的问题。

Method: 使用大型扩散变换器（Flux.1），引入双分支调节器和自适应调制计划，结合SigLIP特征实现语义对齐。

Result: 在合成和真实场景基准测试中表现优于开源和商业基线。

Conclusion: LucidFlux证明，对于大型DiTs，调节的时机、位置和内容比增加参数或依赖文本提示更重要。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）可解释性的方法，通过视觉分支的多尺度解释聚合（MSEA）和文本分支的激活排名相关性（ARC）来提升解释的连贯性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，忽略了模态内依赖关系，导致解释碎片化和噪声干扰。

Method: 视觉分支采用MSEA动态调整感受野，文本分支采用ARC抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在多个MLLMs和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有可解释性方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释，提升了MLLMs的可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

TL;DR: U-MAN改进U-Net，通过PAGF和MAN模块解决语义鸿沟和多尺度特征提取问题，提升医学图像分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net的简单跳跃连接和多尺度特征提取能力不足，导致医学图像分割中细节和边界不精确。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含PAGF模块（注意力引导特征融合）和MAN模块（多尺度自适应处理）。

Result: 在BUSI、GLAS和CVC数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在边界和细节保留上。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过改进特征融合和多尺度处理，显著提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Result: 实验表明，使用4位原始数据的γ-Quant方法在性能上与使用12位原始数据的方法相当。

Conclusion: γ-Quant为低带宽和能源受限环境下的模式识别提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应用导向的VIF方法需要标注数据，成本高；传统方法仅关注图像质量。SSVIF旨在解决数据标注问题并提升下游任务性能。

Result: 在无标注数据下，SSVIF超越传统方法，媲美有监督方法。

Conclusion: SSVIF为应用导向的VIF提供了一种高效无监督解决方案，显著降低数据依赖。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨域医学图像分割问题，并提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSTTS是一种无需额外参数的即插即用模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择两阶段方法，有效减少事件数据中的时空冗余，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件流转换为事件帧序列时忽略了高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大；且现有RGB视频的令牌稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含空间令牌净化（去除噪声和非事件区域）和时间令牌选择（评估相邻帧运动模式相似性以去除冗余）。

Result: 在多个数据集和骨干网络上，PSTTS显著降低FLOPs（29-43.6%）并提高FPS（21.6-41.3%），同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS通过利用事件数据的时空分布特性，实现了精度与效率的优化平衡。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

TL;DR: GCPO提出了一种针对关键图像令牌的优化方法，显著提升了AR视觉生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像令牌进行统一优化，忽略了不同令牌对RLVR训练的贡献差异。

Method: 通过因果依赖、熵诱导空间结构和RLVR令牌多样性三个角度识别关键令牌，并引入动态令牌优势权重进行优化。

Result: GCPO仅使用30%的令牌即可超越全令牌优化的GRPO，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: GCPO为AR视觉生成提供了一种高效的关键令牌优化方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对MLLMs生成的令牌对视觉模态的依赖程度理解不足，限制了模型的解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE通过贪婪搜索优化目标函数，结合充分性（insight score）和必要性（necessity score），对稀疏化图像区域进行高效且忠实的归因分析。

Result: 实验表明，EAGLE在忠实性、定位和幻觉诊断方面优于现有方法，且GPU内存需求显著降低。

Conclusion: EAGLE有效提升了MLLMs的可解释性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，也是交流的重要手段。随着VLMs的普及，了解其是否像人类一样命名颜色对有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 研究复制了经典颜色命名方法，使用957个颜色样本评估了五种代表性VLMs，并进行了跨语言分析和消融实验。

Result: VLMs在典型颜色上准确率高，但在非典型颜色上表现显著下降。研究发现21个常见颜色术语，并揭示了两种命名策略：受限模型使用基本术语，而扩展模型使用系统亮度修饰词。跨语言分析显示英语和中文的训练数据占主导地位。

Conclusion: VLMs的颜色命名能力受语言模型架构显著影响，且存在跨语言不平衡问题，需进一步优化以提高人机交互效果。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Conclusion: EfficientDepth通过创新架构和训练策略，有效解决了单目深度估计中的关键问题，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen

significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and

Motivation: 现有SSL方法难以捕捉复杂异常的语义，而LLM计算成本高且缺乏空间定位能力。

Method: HyCoVAD采用nnFormer骨干的SSL模块进行多任务学习，筛选异常帧后由LLM进行语义验证。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上，HyCoVAD帧级AUC达72.5%，超越基线12.5%。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD有效结合SSL和LLM优势，为复杂VAD提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among

*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探索了2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）作为视觉语言模型的新视觉表示方法，解决了RGB图像传输和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB视觉编码器在传输和计算上存在效率问题，2DGS提供了一种紧凑且高效的替代方案。

Method: 开发了可扩展的2DGS流水线，结合结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和CUDA优化，并适配了CLIP训练方法。

Result: 2DGS实现了90倍以上的拟合加速和97%的GPU利用率，输入压缩3到20倍，但精度略低于RGB编码器。

Conclusion: 2DGS是一种可行的多模态表示方法，为边缘云计算提供了语义强大且传输高效的路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

TL;DR: LongLive是一个实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存、流式长调优和短窗口注意力等设计，解决了长视频生成的效率和质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成在效率和质量上存在挑战，现有方法如扩散模型效率低，而自回归模型在长视频上质量下降。此外，交互式能力对动态内容创作至关重要。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，整合KV重缓存机制、流式长调优和短窗口注意力，支持实时交互和长视频训练。

Result: 在32 GPU天内微调1.3B参数模型，支持240秒视频生成，推理速度达20.7 FPS，性能优异。

Conclusion: LongLive高效解决了长视频生成的挑战，支持实时交互和高性能推理。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过协同训练策略和奖励模型，高效解决了RLHF和RLVR的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF的高成本和RLVR的监督浪费问题，提出更高效的协同训练方法。

Method: SPARK框架利用回收的rollouts和正确性数据，通过多目标训练生成奖励模型。

Result: SPARK在多个基准测试中表现优异，如推理任务提升9.7%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过自反馈循环实现了高效、稳定的模型优化，无需外部奖励模型。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型自监督卷积方法CCNeXt，在深度估计任务中优于现有CNN和ViT模型，同时兼顾计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但获取可靠的真实深度数据困难，自监督技术成为解决方案。

Method: 采用现代CNN特征提取器和新型窗口极线交叉注意力模块的编码器，重新设计深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上表现优异，速度提升10.18倍，并在改进的真实数据和Driving Stereo数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了高效与性能的平衡，代码开源以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT提出了一种基于UML的结构化推理框架，显著提升了语言模型在任务规划和执行中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT方法依赖非结构化文本，限制了其在具体任务中的可解释性和可执行性。现有结构化方法（如场景图或逻辑图）仅能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承或行为抽象等高级构造。

Method: 采用UML类图捕捉对象语义，活动图建模控制流程，并通过三阶段训练（监督微调+GRPO）结合答案数据奖励学习。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划一致性和执行成功率上均优于非结构化CoT。

Conclusion: UML是一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量、领域特定数据集标注的瓶颈问题，平衡数据质量、多样性和成本。

Method: 使用大型多模态语言模型作为中央协调器，结合校准发现、可控合成和共识标注三种核心能力。

Result: 在COCO数据集上平均每张图像生成14.2个候选提案，标注mAP达37.1%；在Open Images数据集上发现903个新类别。

Conclusion: 代理工作流程和优化工具为工业级数据集标注提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到或接近最优性能，无需生成模型适应或外部工具。

Conclusion: DIPSY通过正负引导的双图像提示，有效生成类区分特征，特别适用于细粒度分类任务。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Motivation: 探索VAR与扩散模型之间的理论联系，以提升视觉生成任务的效率和效果。

Method: 通过引入Markovian注意力掩码，将VAR重新解释为离散扩散模型（SRDD），并利用扩散模型的优势优化VAR。

Result: SRDD方法在多个数据集上实现了更快的收敛、更低的推理成本和更好的零样本重建效果。

Conclusion: 扩散模型视角为VAR带来了效率和生成质量的提升，建立了AR变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过分层表示匹配提升CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，利用LLM生成层次化文本描述，实现精确分类并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单模板，忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且CLIP仅使用最后一层特征，缺乏分层信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成层次化文本描述，匹配不同语义层次并自适应路由。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN通过层次化表示匹配显著提升CLIP在类增量学习中的表现。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 研究人类是否能识别AI生成的视频并提供具体原因，填补了现有研究中对时空视觉伪影检测的空白。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，训练多模态语言模型模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在假线索识别、定位和解释上平均优于GPT-5 34.7%。

Conclusion: DeeptraceReward为社交意识和可信视频生成提供了严格的测试和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CapRL的新训练框架，通过强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）解决图像描述任务的主观性挑战，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像描述模型依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型泛化能力差且缺乏多样性。CapRL旨在通过强化学习解决这一问题。

Method: CapRL采用两阶段训练框架：LVLM生成描述，非视觉LLM基于描述回答选择题，奖励基于回答准确性。

Result: CapRL在12个基准测试中表现优异，在Prism框架下性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，平均超出基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL通过强化学习显著提升了图像描述任务的性能，为开放任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Motivation: 现有指代分割方法通常需要微调或多模型组合，而扩散模型的特征提取能力未被充分利用。

Method: 利用扩散变换器的特征和注意力分数，通过过滤停用词、处理全局注意力汇和注意力重分配策略提升性能。

Result: 在零样本指代图像和视频分割任务中，RefAM无需微调或额外组件即达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的特征和注意力机制可直接用于下游任务，无需训练或架构修改，性能优越。

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

Result: LLMs对实验反馈不敏感，传统方法表现更优；LLMNN在多个领域表现优异。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs不适合实际实验设计，需结合先验推理与后验更新的混合框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Conclusion: NUFILT通过结构替代和优化设计，有效实现模型合并的透明性和保真度，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Conclusion: SIGN方法在稳定性和生成效率上表现出色，适用于多步采样和零样本编辑。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Result: 证明了幻觉是损失最小化与人类期望输出之间的结构性问题，且最优估计器也无法避免。

Conclusion: 幻觉是生成模型中的结构性问题，源于损失最小化与人类期望的不一致，需要通过校准来解决。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: d2通过强化学习显著提升DLMs的推理能力，证明了掩码特性在扩散推理中的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Result: VISION在KD48基准上显著优于现有模型，且在极端数据缺失下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 工作为数据不确定性下的海洋科学研究提供了高质量基准和鲁棒模型。

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 共形数据增强是一种高效且可证明风险控制的数据增强方法。

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: FedZero在理论和应用上均有突破，新开发的浓度工具具有独立价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂储层系统的高效控制提供了新途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Conclusion: 通过设计良好的先验分布生成合成图进行预训练，是构建图基础模型的有效策略。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Conclusion: SlimDiff是首个无需训练、基于激活的结构压缩方法，兼具理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过优化问题，并有效提升了语言模型的微调效果。

Conclusion: 评分标准奖励机制是一种有效的解决方案，能够在高奖励区域准确区分响应质量，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Conclusion: cMIM为表示学习提供了统一框架，适用于生成和判别任务。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型中反向时间速度可能变得僵硬且隐含允许无限传播速度的问题，Kac动力学提供有限速度传输和全局有界动能的优势。

Method: 引入速度空间的分类器自由引导，并提出端点蒸馏方法，训练学生模型在长区间内匹配冻结的教师模型。

Result: 实验表明，DistillKac能以极少的函数评估生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性。

Conclusion: DistillKac通过有限速度传输和端点蒸馏，实现了高效且稳定的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KT模型在学生选择干扰项时预测错误较多，导致学生错误未被检测到。研究旨在通过不确定性捕捉提升模型能力。

Method: 提出一种方法，通过捕捉预测不确定性来增强KT模型。

Result: 研究表明，KT模型中的不确定性信息丰富，且较大的预测不确定性与模型错误预测相关。

Conclusion: 不确定性信号在教育学习平台中具有教学价值，尤其在资源有限且需要理解学生能力的场景中。

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为$\mathbf{Li_2}$的新框架，用于描述双层非线性网络中的grokking行为，揭示了梯度动态在三个阶段的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究grokking现象（延迟泛化）的数学框架，以理解复杂结构化输入中特征的出现条件与机制。

Method: 提出$\mathbf{Li_2}$框架，分析梯度$G_F$在三个阶段（惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习）中的动态变化。

Result: 揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本量等超参数的作用，证明了记忆和泛化的可扩展规律，并解释了优化器Muon的有效性。

Conclusion: $\mathbf{Li_2}$框架为理解grokking提供了理论基础，并可扩展到多层架构。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一种新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过结合教师、学生和对抗生成器，重新设计了半监督学习的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架中的静态视图交互、不可靠伪标签和缺乏困难样本建模等关键问题。

Method: 采用三元交互结构，包括两个学生分类器、一个元学习教师和一个非参数生成器，通过Stackelberg博弈优化策略。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet等数据集上，TRiCo在低标签情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一种通用且高效的半监督学习解决方案，适用于多种架构和冻结视觉骨干网络。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性的框架，用于在LLM推理时提供安全控制，通过运行时监控和最小扰动机制减少有害生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLHF方法在训练时有效，但在推理时无法防止有害内容的生成，需要更安全的推理时控制机制。

Method: BRT-Align将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过反向可达性学习安全值函数，预测轨迹的最坏情况演化。

Result: 实验表明，BRT-Align能更早、更准确地检测有害生成，并显著减少有害内容，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为LLM推理时安全提供了原则性和实用的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Conclusion: 该框架填补了大型语言模型增强潜力与专业领域安全需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

Result: 发现自适应归纳头能够学习上下文中的注意力分配，并通过潜在上下文揭示标记转换关系。

Conclusion: LLMs不仅具备学习能力的归纳头，还能机制化地学习高阶重复模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Method: 借鉴非人类动物元认知研究，通过两种实验范式测试LLM是否能策略性地利用内部状态知识。

Result: 前沿LLM展现出评估和利用自身置信度的能力，但分辨率有限且与人类不同。不同模型间存在差异，表明训练后可能影响元认知能力。

Conclusion: LLM具备有限的元认知能力，但与人类不同，训练后可能进一步开发这些能力。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Result: 提供了一系列工具，用于在离线和在线学习环境中获得理论保证。

Conclusion: 通过统计工具，为机器学习中的选择过程提供了理论支持，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Result: 在仿真和真实数据集上验证了GDM建模软、粘性状态和过渡的能力。

Conclusion: GDM在随机时间序列中推断可解释状态的能力优于传统方法。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的遗忘问题，提升了模型在多任务环境下的性能。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

Result: 在多个数据集上减少250倍激活存储，保持精度；在持续学习任务中性能接近正交梯度投影方法。

Conclusion: LANCE是设备端高效微调和持续学习的实用解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型模型资源消耗高，且早期训练阶段权重变化较大，后期趋于稳定，适合低秩矩阵捕捉。

Method: 通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，并根据各层收敛程度分配特定秩。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在保持模型精度的同时，将可训练参数减少至10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%。

Conclusion: 动态切换至LoRA能有效减少训练资源消耗，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

TL;DR: HIP模型通过深度学习直接预测分子Hessian矩阵，避免了自动微分或有限差分的高计算成本，显著提升了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但传统计算方法成本高且难以扩展。本研究旨在通过深度学习直接预测Hessian矩阵，解决这一问题。

Method: 利用SE(3)-等变图神经网络，通过消息传递中的不可约表示特征（l=2）构建对称Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP模型在计算速度、准确性、内存效率和训练难度上均优于传统方法，并在过渡态搜索、几何优化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: HIP模型为Hessian矩阵的直接预测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算化学领域的发展。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BHRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过分块Hadamard调制提升局部秩放大，优于现有PEFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PEFT方法（如LoRA和HiRA）在全局调制或低秩约束下的局限性。

Method: 提出BHRA，分块应用HiRA式调制，保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大。

Result: 在多个任务和模型上，BHRA表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BHRA通过分块设计有效解决了全局调制的频谱崩溃问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Method: 基于线性模型理论分析，提出随机随机掩码自编码（R²MAE）预训练方案。

Result: R²MAE在视觉、语言、DNA序列和单细胞模型中均优于现有掩码方案。

Conclusion: R²MAE通过多尺度特征捕获提升性能，为掩码预训练提供新思路。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 探索安全、信任和AGI的数学定义，揭示它们之间的内在矛盾。

Result: 证明安全且受信任的AI系统无法成为AGI系统。

Conclusion: 严格的数学定义下，安全、信任和AGI不可兼得，但实际应用可能采用更宽松的定义。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在偏差或计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效、稳定的推理时间适应方法。

Method: 利用Fokker-Planck方程中的自由度，提出Variance-和Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG)来优化漂移。

Result: 在多个任务中，DriftLite显著降低了方差并提高了样本质量。

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时间适应提供了一种高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设数据来自特定结构方程模型，可能与真实数据生成过程不符，且忽略离散数据中的复杂依赖结构。

Method: 提出一个可微分结构学习框架，通过单次可微分优化任务学习参数和结构，避免不现实的简化假设。

Result: 证明了在纯观测数据下，虽然一般离散模型不可识别，但可以刻画兼容参数和结构的完整集合，并在温和假设下实现马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Conclusion: 实证结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉离散数据中的复杂关系，具有更广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Conclusion: RED-DiffEq为PDE反问题提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式建模对象状态和系统性评估，显著提升多模态计划生成质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了神经符号集成方法，支持任意程度的知识指定，且性能无损离散化。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，单调性约束能持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: DIM通过领域知识的单调性约束有效提升了深度神经网络的预测性能并减少了过拟合。

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at

Motivation: 现有基础模型主要针对日常活动分类，限制了其在更广泛任务中的应用。SlotFM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用时频槽注意力机制生成多个小嵌入（槽），并引入两种损失正则化器以捕捉局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个分类和回归任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了传感基础模型的强大泛化能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Result: 实验表明，该方法收敛速度显著快于现有一阶方法，且统计准确性相当。

Conclusion: 通过黎曼优化框架，成功解决了K-means聚类的计算挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

Result: SpecMER实现了24-32%的加速，更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER在保持推测解码效率的同时，显著提升了生成序列的生物合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance

TL;DR: ReLAM通过关键点提取和子目标规划，自动生成密集奖励信号，显著提升视觉强化学习在机器人操作中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界中精确的位置信息难以获取，传统基于距离的奖励设计在视觉RL中效果不佳。

Method: 提出ReLAM框架，通过学习预测模型生成子目标，提供连续奖励信号，结合分层强化学习训练策略。

Result: 在复杂任务中，ReLAM显著加速学习并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过结构化奖励设计，解决了视觉RL中的奖励瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进方法，通过最小辅助信息提升仅基于PPG的心脏骤停预测系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPG基础模型（如PPG-GPT）在预测心脏骤停等关键事件时表现强大，但在下游数据/标签稀缺时仍需优化。

Method: 1. 使用时间到事件建模（回归或离散生存分析）；2. 通过对抗训练学习患者身份不变的心脏骤停特征；3. 利用预训练辅助网络生成伪标签进行回归。

Result: 改进方法将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升至0.78-0.80范围，尤其在长时预测中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过多任务优化和PCGrad技术缓解梯度冲突，推动了早期预警系统的研究。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Motivation: 图级预测任务中，输入图的子图信息至关重要，但构建兼具高判别能力和可解释性的模型仍具挑战性。

Method: 结合精确子图枚举、神经网络和稀疏正则化，提出EIN模型。稀疏正则化支持有效剪枝策略和重要子图识别。

Result: EIN在预测性能上优于标准图神经网络模型，并通过后验分析展示了所选子图的可解释性。

Conclusion: EIN通过子图枚举和稀疏正则化，实现了高判别能力和可解释性，为图级预测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Conclusion: 该研究方法为改进交通服务和城市发展提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上，PQFed显著提升目标客户模型性能，且在低参与场景中优于IFCA。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习中具有可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Motivation: 现代机器学习中，如何在看似顺序的模型中利用并行性是一个核心挑战。

Method: 通过将非线性递归近似为线性动力系统，统一了牛顿、皮卡德和雅可比迭代等方法。

Result: 该框架揭示了这些技术背后的共同原理，并明确了不同固定点方法的适用场景。

Conclusion: 通过LDS语言，为并行化顺序模型提供了更清晰的理论基础，并指出了高效计算的新方向。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Result: 通过基准数据集验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在双层优化问题中表现优异。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为AD早期个体化预测提供了新工具，揭示了新的神经生物学机制和性别特异性生物标志物。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物分子优化方法样本效率低，LLM的上下文学习和指令跟随能力适合迭代优化，但现有方法未充分利用这一优势。

Method: POLO引入PGPO算法，通过轨迹级优化和轮级偏好学习，从完整优化轨迹中提取学习信号。

Result: POLO在单属性任务中平均成功率达84%（比基线高2.3倍），多属性任务中达50%，仅需500次评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用每次评估，显著提升了分子优化的样本效率，成为当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Conclusion: BrainPoG能高效学习疾病相关知识，适用于脑疾病检测任务。

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Conclusion: HyperCore适用于可扩展且无噪声的学习，生成紧凑且信息丰富的子集。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

Motivation: 现有coreset选择方法需要昂贵的训练信号，违背了高效训练的目的，因此需要一种无需训练的方法。

Method: SubZeroCore通过子模覆盖和密度的统一目标，采用基于闭式解的采样策略，平衡覆盖和密度。

Result: SubZeroCore在无需训练的情况下，性能与基于训练的方法相当，高修剪率下表现更优，且对标签噪声更鲁棒。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore是一种高效、鲁棒的coreset选择方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 传统4DVAR的代价函数难以优化且计算量大，需要改进。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化连续时空状态，结合物理约束的损失函数，实现并行优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上测试，相比基线4DVAR，新方法估计的初始条件更稳定且无虚假振荡。

Conclusion: 新框架无需真实状态或再分析数据，适用性更广。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

Result: KNN分类器在单任务和双任务中的准确率分别为75.0%和66.7%。脱氧血红蛋白水平比氧合血红蛋白更能预测MS患者，关键脑区为同侧半球的上缘/角回和中央前回。

Conclusion: fNIRS数据分析揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激目标。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅依赖复杂度指标，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致结果难以解释。EIC通过数值稳定性评估结构合理性。

Method: 提出EIC标准，将公式视为信息处理系统，通过数值稳定性（如有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大）识别不合理结构。

Result: 结合EIC改进了搜索和生成式符号回归算法的性能，减少了不合理结构，提高了样本效率（2~4倍）。

Conclusion: EIC与专家偏好高度一致（70.2%），证明其能有效衡量公式的可解释性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

Method: 提出并发感知推测解码框架和在线草稿学习机制，动态调整策略以适应实时并发水平。

Result: 实验显示端到端加速2.35x至2.72x，效率显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GRPO训练瓶颈，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一信号模态，而多信号间的统计关系可能提升分类性能。

Method: 使用DROZY数据集，提取ECG、EMG、EOG和EEG信号特征，评估15种信号组合及多种分类器。

Result: XGBoost结合EMG和EEG信号表现最优，多信号模型优于单一信号模型。

Conclusion: 多信号特征融合能显著提升疲劳监测系统的准确性、可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

TL;DR: ChaosNexus是一种预训练的基础模型，用于提高混沌系统的预测能力，通过多尺度架构和专家混合层实现零样本和少样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌系统（如天气预测和流体动力学）对初始条件敏感且数据稀缺，传统模型缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 提出ChaosNexus，采用ScaleFormer多尺度架构和Mixture-of-Experts层，捕捉通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在9000多个合成混沌系统上，长期吸引子统计保真度提高40%；在5天全球天气预报中，零样本平均误差低于1度。

Conclusion: 跨系统泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性，而非数据量。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Conclusion: 未来可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）的扩展规律，以比较其性能。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Result: 实验证实SAM确实会收敛到虚假极小值点。

Conclusion: 提出了一种简单有效的解决方案以避免虚假极小值点。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境下，标准MARL算法因缺乏中间奖励而难以有效指导策略学习。

Method: 引入基于偏好的价值分解网络，生成全局和局部奖励信号，并构建双重优势流以区分学习目标。利用LLM提供偏好标签增强奖励模型。

Result: 在MAMuJoCo和SMACv2等基准测试中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏奖励环境下的在线MARL挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

Result: MATU方法实现了近乎无ϵ的复杂度，显著优于现有均匀扩散方法。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中的实际优势。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Result: 统一分析恢复J-L引理等结果，改进联邦学习收敛边界，设计更优老虎机算法。

Conclusion: 框架为草图双线性形式提供通用分析工具，扩展应用并改进性能。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Method: 将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，提出信息论压缩目标，并基于此设计了动态协作结构GoA。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GoA显著提升了性能，甚至在小上下文窗口下超越了大窗口模型。

Conclusion: GoA是一种高效且通用的长上下文建模方法，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular

Result: 在多种LLM架构和基准测试中表现优异，显著减少token使用。

Conclusion: LDAR有效平衡信息覆盖与干扰，提升LLM输出质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

Motivation: 解决Neural ODEs在鲁棒性和准确性之间的张力问题，通过主动控制吸引区域（RoAs）的几何形状来平衡两者。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，包括三部分损失函数（一致性、分类和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法，设计基于输入注意力的凸神经网络。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Zubov-Net通过理论证明和实验验证，成功平衡了鲁棒性和准确性，为Neural ODEs提供了新的稳定学习范式。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types

Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，IVT显著提升了基线模型的性能，如CIFAR-100上PASS基线的最终准确率提升5.12%。

Conclusion: IVT是一种有效的增量学习框架，能够稳定历史任务性能，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 新框架通用性强，涵盖现有方法，适用于掩码扩散模型。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

TL;DR: MACMs结合了CESR和GAMs的优点，通过引入加法部分解耦交互和独立项系数，提升了预测性能并保持了可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗）中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR虽包含交互效应但性能不佳。

Method: 提出MACMs，结合CESR的乘法部分和加法部分，解耦系数并扩展假设空间，同时保持形状函数的可视化。

Result: 实验表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，显著提升了预测性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Conclusion: 该框架将时间序列分析与可视化结合，为能源分析提供了可扩展且可解释的方法。

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Method: 使用统计物理方法，在单位置回归任务中分析高维极限下的注意力机制性能。

Result: softmax在理论上达到贝叶斯风险最优，而线性注意力无法实现；在有限样本下，softmax仍优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax因其特性在注意力机制中表现最优，梯度优化算法也支持这一结论。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层扩散方法通常采用固定的两层结构和单一时间尺度，限制了适应性和决策灵活性。

Method: 通过分析离线轨迹中的结构信息自适应构建扩散层次，利用结构信息增益作为条件信号，并引入结构熵正则化器减少对离线数据的依赖。

Result: 在挑战性离线RL任务中，SIHD在决策性能和泛化能力上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SIHD通过自适应多时间尺度建模和结构信息利用，提升了离线策略学习的有效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

Result: 攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%，计算成本仅增加6%。

Conclusion: Active Attacks是一种高效且可扩展的方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

Result: 实验表明，该方法在提高任务性能的同时显著减少了平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且高效，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

Conclusion: GRAMDTI通过高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督，显著提升了药物靶点相互作用预测的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

Motivation: 理解CFG在多模态条件下的采样动态，弥补现有研究局限于单模态或简化情况的不足。

Method: 分析CFG在多模态条件下的采样过程，将其分为三个阶段：方向偏移、模式分离和集中。

Result: 实验证实强指导在不同阶段对多样性和质量的影响，并提出时变指导计划以优化两者。

Conclusion: CFG的采样动态揭示了指导强度与多样性之间的权衡，时变指导计划可提升模型性能。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Conclusion: SGRL通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝，有效提升了RL代理在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策能力。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Concept-SAE生成的标记具有高保真度和空间局部性，优于其他解缠方法。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为从相关性解释转向机制性、因果性模型行为探测提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中链接预测因数据不足和边稀疏而受限的问题。

Method: 提出AEGIS框架，通过均匀或逆度偏置重采样现有边，保留原始节点集，避免伪造端点。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，语义KNN增强显著提升AUC和校准性；在GDP图上，语义KNN和简单重采样均降低Brier分数。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的高效策略，语义增强在节点描述可用时效果更佳。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的微调方法，解决了现有PEFT方法的局限性。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在组合问题（如数独）上的局限性，提升其性能。

Method: 使用GPT-2模型，结合模仿学习和DFS探索策略，最小化猜测次数。

Result: 在数独任务上达到99%的准确率，优于现有神经符号方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs解决NP类问题提供了新思路，且无需定制架构或外部工具。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

*Haodong Pan,Yusong Wang,Nanning Zheng,Caijui Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGM是一种轻量级模块，通过高效聚类操作为几何GNN提供全局上下文，显著提升分子几何建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何GNN在捕捉分子几何结构方面表现优异，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在计算成本高、缺乏通用性或参数调优复杂等问题。

Method: 提出MCGM模块，通过多阶段聚类构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，动态提取全局信息并通过学习变换传播，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在OE62和AQM数据集上，MCGM分别平均降低能量预测误差26.2%，并达到SOTA精度（能量误差17.0 meV，力误差4.9 meV/Å），同时参数减少20%。

Conclusion: MCGM是一种高效、通用的全局建模模块，可无缝集成到多种GNN架构中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OrtSAE通过正交性约束改进稀疏自编码器，减少特征吸收和组合，提升特征解耦能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收和组合问题，影响特征的可解释性和独立性。

Method: 提出正交稀疏自编码器（OrtSAE），通过惩罚高余弦相似性来强制特征正交性。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多独特特征（+9%），减少特征吸收（65%）和组合（15%），并在下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: OrtSAE有效解决了传统SAE的问题，提升了特征解耦和任务性能。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）缺乏GAN中的直观潜在向量控制，限制了艺术表达的灵活性。

Method: 通过直接操作概念和空间表示，将潜在空间操作整合到扩散过程中。

Result: 展示了两个艺术作品，揭示了潜在空间中的语义和无意义区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成艺术提供了新的可能性，并为潜在空间的进一步探索铺平了道路。

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful
means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion
models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in
GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces
\workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations
into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and
spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in
generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two
artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its
use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法可能忽略局部非凸性，CDP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别可接受对，计算非凸性结构矩阵，并使用其前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供了两种可验证的保证：后验配对证书和平均谱界。

Conclusion: CDP在保留局部非凸性方面表现优异，并提供可验证的保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

TL;DR: MO-GRPO通过自动归一化奖励函数，解决了GRPO在多目标强化学习中的奖励黑客问题，并在多个任务中表现优于GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在多目标设置中容易因奖励黑客问题而优化单一目标，牺牲其他目标，因此需要一种无需手动调整奖励函数的方法。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，通过归一化方法根据奖励值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数均匀贡献。

Result: MO-GRPO在多个任务中表现稳定且优于GRPO，解决了奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习中的一种有前景的算法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG模型未能有效捕捉通道间和区域间交互，且缺乏对脑状态的感知学习，限制了其性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习块和脑状态解耦块，通过并行编码器和解耦损失实现状态感知表示学习。

Result: 在九个公共BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新设计解决了EEG模型的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失的方法，以增强软标签中的类内多样性，并通过边缘损失解决训练不稳定和收敛慢的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有蒸馏方法中，教师模型主要依赖真实标签作为目标，忽略了同一类别内的多样性表示，导致学生模型泛化能力受限。

Method: 在教师训练中引入类内对比损失，并结合边缘损失以提高训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法能有效丰富类内多样性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过增强软标签的类内信息，提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Result: 研究发现迁移参数可作为通用知识载体，并识别了影响其效果的关键因素；同时揭示了某些情况下迁移参数效果不佳的原因。

Conclusion: 研究填补了部分参数迁移的理论空白，为实际应用提供了理论指导和实证支持。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨激活导向技术是否如预期那样能提供精确、可解释且安全的模型控制。

Method: 在不同模型家族上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向和稀疏自编码器（SAE）导向的影响。

Result: 激活导向显著增加有害请求的合规性，随机方向可达2-27%，SAE导向进一步增加2-4%。20个随机向量的组合可形成通用攻击。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了通过可解释性实现安全的范式，表明对模型内部的精确控制并不能保证对行为的精确控制。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上，NL-SME显著优于基线方法，实现了数量级的改进。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了联邦学习的隐私漏洞，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range

SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency

the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks

Result: 实验表明，该方法在可行性和长期有效性上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 强调将时间和行为动态纳入实际补救系统设计的重要性。

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为运动心理学提供了一种可解释、数据驱动的框架，有助于运动员发展和决策支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Conclusion: 悲观双层优化在回归场景中具有潜力，能提升模型的抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

Motivation: 解决无批评方法（如GRPO）因样本和令牌信息量低导致的收敛慢问题。

Method: 提出D$^3$S框架，包括样本级（最大化优势方差）和令牌级（优先高影响力和不确定性的令牌）下采样，结合动态调度。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上实现SOTA性能，减少样本和令牌需求。

Conclusion: D$^3$S显著提升策略优化的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

*Moritz Piening,Robert Beinert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于1d Wasserstein等距的双切片Wasserstein（DSW）度量，用于高效计算元度量之间的距离，避免了高阶矩的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有切片WoW加速方法依赖参数化元度量或高阶矩，导致数值不稳定，需要更高效稳定的替代方案。

Method: 利用1d Wasserstein空间与$L_2([0,1])$中分位数函数的等距性，引入基于Banach空间的切片框架，通过高斯过程参数化无限维$L_2$-投影。

Result: DSW在离散元度量上与WoW最小化等价，避免了高阶矩问题，计算效率更高，实验验证了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: DSW是一种高效稳定的WoW替代方案，适用于数据集、形状和图像的距离计算。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过同时优化近似性和代码利用率，显著提升了平滑向量量化的效果。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

Motivation: 激活剪枝在动态压缩和减少I/O开销方面潜力巨大，但研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过后训练的N:M激活剪枝方法，结合轻量级误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，评估不同稀疏模式。

Result: 在相同稀疏度下，激活剪枝比权重剪枝更能保留生成能力，8:16模式在灵活性和硬件实现间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 本文提供了有效的激活剪枝方法，并呼吁未来硬件支持更灵活的稀疏模式。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一种动态权重分配框架，用于多智能体网络中的信息聚合，显著加速去中心化学习，同时减少通信和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化的基础设施中，传统静态权重分配方法（如Metropolis权重）无法适应数据异构性，DYNAWEIGHT旨在通过动态权重分配优化学习效率。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT根据相邻服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先选择信息多样化的服务器。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT显著提高了训练速度，且适用于任何底层服务器级优化算法。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT是一种高效且通用的信息聚合方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Result: 证明了在非线性、非可逆混合下，潜在子空间的可识别性，并建立了准则间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该研究明确了在不依赖统计假设的情况下，解耦表示可识别的条件。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Result: 在真实图数据集上，KReTTaH优于现有方法，包括非参数张量和神经网络方法。

Conclusion: KReTTaH是一种高效、灵活的多维数据插补方法，适用于动态图流估计等场景。

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Conclusion: R-GNS是首个统一耗散流体系统正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，具有高效和物理一致性。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Result: 实验证明，当p > dn时，可以从模型参数中成功重建整个训练数据集。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建的规律，即参数数量超过dn时，模型能够完全重建训练数据。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Conclusion: 框架能有效发现单参数子群，生成可解释的对称感知表示。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测场景中，框架学习到更公平的策略，性能损失较小。

Conclusion: 框架适用于多种问题，且个体与群体公平性不一定相互包含，需独立考虑。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Conclusion: ASSESS框架和TransTED相似性度量有效解决了形式化语句相似性评估的问题，并提供了公开的基准和实现代码。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training

*Nassim Walha,Sebastian G. Gruber,Thomas Decker,Yinchong Yang,Alireza Javanmardi,Eyke Hüllermeier,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Uncertainty的新方法，用于量化和分解大语言模型中的不确定性，基于量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵，区分了固有数据模糊性（aleatoric uncertainty）和模型局限性（epistemic uncertainty）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型应用的普及，准确测量其预测不确定性变得至关重要，尤其是区分不同来源的不确定性。

Method: 利用冯·诺依曼熵，将总不确定性分解为aleatoric和epistemic两部分，并通过语义相似性进行细粒度表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在估计aleatoric和总不确定性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty为不确定性量化提供了理论严谨且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: PatchMoE是一种基于MoE的新型时间序列分析框架，通过任务感知的路由策略和时空相关性建模，显著提升了多任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构在时间序列分析中因任务无关的路由器和缺乏通道相关性建模能力而表现不佳。

Method: 提出PatchMoE框架，采用Recurrent Noisy Gating利用分层信息进行任务感知路由，并通过时空负载均衡损失建模时空相关性。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的实验表明PatchMoE达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知设计和时空相关性建模，为时间序列分析提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散自编码器的无线语义通信系统，通过学习语义到干净信号的映射，解决了传统自编码器在信号分布探索和可扩展性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统主要关注通道自适应的神经编解码方案，缺乏对信号分布的充分探索，且自编码器架构导致编解码紧密耦合，存在可扩展性问题。

Method: 使用扩散自编码器模型，通过神经编码器提取高层语义，条件扩散模型（CDiff）在接收端利用源分布进行信号空间去噪，并将语义潜在变量作为条件输入引导解码过程。

Result: 理论证明该解码器是真实数据的一致估计器，实验在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上验证了其性能优于传统自编码器和变分自编码器（VAE），并扩展到多用户语义通信场景。

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器模型在语义通信中表现出色，解决了传统方法的局限性，为实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，通过改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化的顶点特征，避免局部最优并提升划分质量。针对不同数据规模设计了两种MST策略，并引入细化策略进一步优化结果。实验表明，该算法在多种划分方式下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图划分方法在处理不同规模数据时存在局部最优和划分质量不足的问题，需要一种更高效且适应性强的框架。

Method: 采用多目标非凸约束松弛模型，结合改进的加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征。针对小规模数据使用Prim算法构建MST并剪枝聚类，大规模数据则选择代表性节点构建MST。引入贪婪迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，算法在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割尺寸，特定实例提升达35%。在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis等方法，细化策略使hMetis划分提升16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分中表现出优越性和竞争力，尤其在处理加权顶点集时效果显著，验证了其性能优势和适应性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域泛化在时间序列预测中很重要，但现有方法要么缺乏多模态知识的显式利用，要么不支持零样本推理。

Method: Aurora通过标记化、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，并利用模态引导的多头自注意力将其注入时间表示建模中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Aurora在单模态和多模态场景下均表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Aurora通过多模态知识提取和原型引导的流匹配，显著提升了跨域时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家（MoE）架构在大语言模型中表现优异，但参数过多导致内存需求高，现有剪枝方法粒度粗，精度损失大。

Method: HEAPr利用二阶信息衡量原子专家重要性，通过优化计算和存储复杂度，仅需少量计算即可完成剪枝。

Result: 实验表明，HEAPr在20%~25%的压缩比下几乎无损，同时减少20%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: HEAPr在MoE模型中实现了高效且精确的剪枝，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Conclusion: 证明了小数据集也能生成有效的数据驱动指纹，并建立了可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中任务不匹配导致的先验知识效用下降问题，尤其是在分布外（OOD）任务中。

Method: 在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调（PEFT），保留先验知识。

Result: APB在样本效率上优于标准RL，并能适应现有元RL基线通常失败的OOD任务。

Conclusion: APB通过轻量级调整有效解决了任务不匹配问题，提升了强化学习的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在移动和延迟敏感环境中因频繁加载和卸载导致的高内存消耗和计算需求问题，同时避免知识蒸馏（KD）带来的性能损失。

Method: 采用渐进式权重加载（PWL）技术，先部署轻量级学生模型，再逐步替换为教师模型的层，并通过训练方法对齐中间特征表示。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL在保持初始推理速度的同时，逐步提升性能，最终达到教师模型的准确率。

Conclusion: PWL适用于动态且资源受限的环境，能够在响应速度和性能之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative
memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural

where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as

Result: 实验表明，这两种正则化方法能有效保持网络的可塑性。

Conclusion: 通过直接解决Hessian谱崩溃问题，提出的方法在持续学习中显著提升了网络的性能。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Result: 在多个医学数据集上，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游任务评估中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专为生存数据设计的扩散模型，能有效生成高质量合成数据。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入时梯度流动受限的问题，同时探索其在模型训练和文本生成中的潜在优势。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用随机激活（SILU或RELU），微调时固定为RELU以减少推理计算量；在生成任务中直接使用随机激活。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，并在推理和生成任务中展现了实用性和多样性优势。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型音频语言模型（LALMs）生成的思维链（CoT）的忠实性，发现其CoT通常能忠实反映模型的决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LALMs生成的CoT是否忠实，尤其是在安全敏感应用中，这一问题此前未被研究。

Method: 通过多种干预措施（如改写、填充标记注入、提前回答和引入错误）在SAKURA和MMAR数据集上评估CoT的忠实性。

Result: 实验表明，LALMs生成的CoT通常能忠实反映其决策过程。

Conclusion: LALMs的CoT在多种干预下仍保持忠实性，这对安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持多模态输入（URL、HTML、IMAGE）的联邦钓鱼网站检测器，通过角色感知桶聚合和硬门控专家实现稳定训练和高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多模态输入（URL、HTML、IMAGE）的灵活性和隐私保护问题，避免跨模态嵌入冲突。

Method: 采用角色感知桶聚合（基于FedProx）和硬门控专家选择，隔离模态特定参数以稳定收敛。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集为95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；文本模态在WebPhish和TR-OP上表现优异。

Conclusion: 桶聚合和硬门控专家设计在严格隐私保护下实现了稳定的联邦训练，并提升了多模态钓鱼检测的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维数据、可解释性、罕见事件检测和多类不平衡问题上面临挑战。

Method: 结合监督学习（XGBoost、随机森林等）、无监督学习（K近邻）、深度学习（多层感知机）、LASSO正则化和纠错输出码，通过特征重要性分析增强透明度。

Result: 在Corporate Credit Ratings数据集上验证，显著提升了信用评级迁移和违约概率估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为信用风险建模提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案，解决了三大核心挑战。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏可解释性，而模型透明性在某些场景中是关键需求。

Method: 在多层逻辑感知器（MLLP）中应用$L_0$正则化，并与随机二值化等方法对比。

Result: 研究了概念规则集（CRS）复杂度与性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: $L_0$正则化在降低复杂度同时保持性能方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpinGPT是首个针对三人在线扑克格式Spin & Go的LLM，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习），性能接近求解器，并在对抗Slumbot时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多玩家游戏中计算复杂度高且纳什均衡不保证非负结果，限制了其在锦标赛中的应用。LLM在棋类游戏中的成功启发了SpinGPT的开发。

Method: SpinGPT通过两阶段训练：1) 在32万高额专家决策上进行监督微调；2) 在27万求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器一致，对抗Slumbot时达到13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100的胜率。

Conclusion: LLM可能是处理多玩家不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Method: 评估了不同多步预测方法（递归、直接、多输入多输出）和机器学习模型对混合系统准确性的影响。

Result: 在12个数据集和21个模型上的结果显示，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: 选择合适的多步预测方法和机器学习模型对提高预测性能至关重要。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

Result: 实验表明MoveFM-R显著优于基线模型，在零样本设置中表现稳健，并能根据自然语言指令生成真实轨迹。

Conclusion: MoveFM-R开创了结合统计与语义的新范式，为人类移动性建模提供了更全面、可解释且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Motivation: 传统LBE数值求解计算量大，受限于碰撞核的时间步长限制。

Method: 结合LBE的固有矩匹配约束和全局等变性，构建物理信息神经算子框架，实现离散不变性和碰撞模型无关性。

Result: 在复杂流动场景（如涡旋脱落、液滴断裂和气泡粘附）中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为动力学系统建模提供了新的数据驱动途径。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Result: UniPrompt在多种预训练模型和跨域场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: UniPrompt为GPL提供了一种更通用和高效的方法，解决了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法通过减少全局同步频率来降低通信开销，但仍有优化空间。

Method: 限制反向传播，每个节点仅更新固定子集参数，其余冻结，减少内存和计算开销。

Result: 在32节点上训练13亿参数语言模型，匹配现有方法的性能，同时降低FLOPs和峰值内存。

Conclusion: 该方法在相同通信预算下显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

Method: 提出WOFTRL，对OFTRL的预测向量进行加权，乐观权重抵消时间延迟。

Result: 理论证明乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和零和游戏中表现优异。

Conclusion: WOFTRL有效解决了时间延迟问题，实验验证了其理论优势。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Result: 实验表明，Flood complex可高效计算数百万点云的持久同调，且在对象分类任务中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Flood complex为大规模点云数据的持久同调计算提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Conclusion: 激活函数的特性对神经ODE的收敛性和性能至关重要，提供了实际训练指导。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练具有更高压缩和泛化能力的神经网络提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Result: IPFM在有限D下蒸馏效果更好，生成样本质量接近或优于教师模型。

Conclusion: IPFM有效加速静电生成模型，且有限D下优化和采样更高效。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Result: 在高压电网测试中，电压和角度的RMSE分别达到0.00033 p.u.和0.08°，比基线模型提升99.5%和87.1%。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS在准确性和速度上均优于传统牛顿-拉夫森方法，适合大规模电网场景。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

TL;DR: IIET通过迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶Transformer架构，结合IIAD蒸馏技术，在性能与效率间取得平衡，显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶数值方法提升Transformer性能但增加计算开销，传统效率技术可能损害性能，需探索更优架构。

Method: 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer）简化高阶方法，并引入IIAD蒸馏技术优化效率。

Result: IIET在lm-evaluation-harness上平均准确率提升2.65%，高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销且保留99.4%准确率。

Conclusion: IIET在性能与效率间实现显著平衡，优于传统Transformer和PCformer。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法依赖手工增强或复杂生成目标，且多忽略3D结构信息，C-FREE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: C-FREE通过预测子图嵌入，结合2D图和3D构象，使用固定半径的ego-nets作为建模单元，无需负样本或位置编码。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，C-FREE在MoleculeNet上表现最优，且能有效迁移到不同化学领域。

Conclusion: 3D结构信息对分子表示学习至关重要，C-FREE展示了其简单高效的优势。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Conclusion: 通过统一高斯过程回归与动态模态分解，改进了Koopman算子的应用效果。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

Conclusion: OFMU通过理论分析和实验验证，展示了其在机器遗忘任务中的优越性，能够更好地平衡遗忘效果和模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: 联合建模对于构建真实且可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器创新和上下文学习，为脑电图建模提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Conclusion: GCN框架在捆绑定价问题中表现出色，适用于不同规模和非加性效用场景，为复杂定价问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索激活函数在持续学习中对抗塑性损失的影响，填补非线性和塑性损失关系的研究空白。

Method: 通过分析负分支形状和饱和行为，提出两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证。

Result: 新激活函数有效缓解塑性损失，无需额外容量或任务特定调整。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计是持续学习中维持塑性的轻量级通用方法。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，源于在高维冗余参数空间中直接优化策略，多任务场景下问题更严重。

Result: 在连续控制任务中验证，策略网络参数可压缩至五个数量级，同时保留表达能力。

Conclusion: 潜在空间学习不仅提升样本效率，还支持通过潜在空间的策略梯度进行任务特定适应。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Motivation: 现有方法通过策略熵刺激探索，但机械的熵最大化容易导致RL训练不稳定。本文旨在通过代理自身经验指导探索与利用的平衡。

Method: SPEAR扩展了SIL框架，引入课程管理探索过程，利用内在奖励促进技能级探索，并通过SIL实现动作级探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估协议EDGE，用于更准确地捕捉类增量学习中模型性能的极端情况，从而更全面地评估性能分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估协议仅从少量随机采样的序列中计算均值和方差，无法全面反映模型性能的真实分布，导致偏差和低估方差。

Method: 提出EDGE协议，利用任务间相似性自适应识别和采样极端序列，以更接近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极端值，提供更准确的分布边界估计。

Conclusion: EDGE为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

Motivation: 解决Mean Flow在多步流匹配过程中行为近似不足的问题。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略融入Mean Flow框架。

Result: 在低维和高维任务（如图像生成、点云生成）中表现优异。

Conclusion: 新方法在单步生成模型中实现了更高的推理准确性。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

TL;DR: RLVR通过QAE方法解决了训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，提升了LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在奖励异常时对负优势样本惩罚不当，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 提出QAE，用K-分位数基线替代均值基线，实现双机制门控。

Result: QAE稳定了熵，稀疏了信用分配，并在多个数据集上提升了pass@1表现。

Conclusion: 基线设计是扩展RLVR的关键机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Motivation: 研究ICL和SFT的不同激活模式，探索ICL的丰富功能是否能改进SFT。

Method: 提出ICL Activation Alignment (IA2)技术，通过自蒸馏复制ICL的激活模式。

Result: 在12个基准测试和2个模型家族中，IA2显著提升了SFT的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅实用，还为模型适应的内部机制提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Conclusion: 论文为DFM模型的理论基础提供了严格分析，明确了其生成分布收敛性的保证，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法常忽视启发式函数的可接受性，且对训练数据外的泛化能力有限。本文旨在解决这两个问题。

Method: 通过将启发式学习建模为约束优化问题，引入CEA损失函数，并利用PDB抽象和图的结构特性研究学习启发式的样本复杂度。

Result: 在魔方领域，CEA方法生成的启发式函数接近可接受性，且比压缩模式数据库（PDB）启发式更具指导性。理论分析表明，使用ReLU神经网络可以降低样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提出了有效的启发式学习方法，还首次为目标依赖启发式提供了泛化保证。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

Conclusion: Plan2Evolve通过自生成数据增强LLM的规划能力，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic
task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

Abstract: Vision-based odometry has been widely adopted in autonomous driving owing to
its low cost and lightweight setup; however, its performance often degrades in

PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates
an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for
long-term robust state estimation. The main contributions are: (i) a novel line
feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between
2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and
triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained
SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion
characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an
efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by
jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo
simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are

Conclusion: LLMs提供的常识知识有效解决了稀疏观测问题，提升了物体级SLAM的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

*Philippe Nadeau,Miguel Rogel,Ivan Bilić,Ivan Petrović,Jonathan Kelly*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法，直接在采样过程中集成稳定性，用于多物体场景中的稳定物体放置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模拟引擎或启发式评估，无法高效且准确地评估物体放置的稳定性。

Method: 通过离线采样规划器收集多模态放置标签，训练扩散模型生成稳定放置，并结合稳定性感知损失。

Result: 在四个基准场景中，物理引导模型比几何方法提高了56%的鲁棒性，并减少了47%的运行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，可直接应用于现有模型，显著提升了稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

Conclusion: VLBiMan结合人类先验与视觉-语言适应机制，为无结构环境中的双手机器人操作提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

Conclusion: 在娱乐和参与导向的机器人设计中，欺骗行为是一种有价值的策略，但需谨慎权衡其复杂影响。

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖轨迹数据分类，难以准确预测变道行为，需要结合场景信息。博弈论能模拟车辆间的交互决策。

Result: 提高了变道预测的准确性，可用于自适应巡航控制等系统，进一步节省燃油。

Conclusion: 结合博弈论和传统模型的方法显著提升了预测性能，适用于实际驾驶辅助系统。

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

Conclusion: WAVE执行器在保护性和刚度调节方面表现出色，适用于复杂环境和接触任务。

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

Result: 实验表明SAGE在多种长时程任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SAGE通过语义场景图有效连接高层规划和低层控制，为长时程操作任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: LCP（可学习的一致性预测）通过上下文感知的神经网络改进传统一致性预测，减少预测集大小并提高安全性，适用于资源受限的机器人系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在机器人任务中输出点估计时置信度校准不足的问题，传统一致性预测（CP）因固定非一致性分数而忽略上下文，导致预测区间过于保守或不安全。

Method: 提出LCP，用轻量级神经网络替代固定非一致性分数，结合几何、语义和任务特征生成上下文感知的不确定性集。

Result: 在分类、目标检测和路径规划任务中，LCP显著优于标准CP和集成方法，减少预测集大小、缩小检测区间并提高安全性。

Conclusion: LCP在保持理论保证的同时，高效且适用于资源受限的自主系统，具有低开销和在线适应能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过平衡数据采样和流匹配技术，有效解决了长尾分布问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

TL;DR: Egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative to costly manual teleoperation for training Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). EgoScaler extracts 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from these videos without auxiliary annotations, improving task success rates by over 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for training VLAs rely on expensive expert-driven teleoperation, while egocentric videos provide a scalable but underutilized resource. This work explores whether VLAs can be trained directly from raw egocentric videos.

Method: The authors introduce EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without auxiliary recordings. They refine noisy trajectories and construct a large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training.

Result: Pre-training on the dataset improves task success rates by over 20%, matches performance with real-robot datasets, and combining both datasets yields further improvements.

Conclusion: Egocentric videos are a scalable and effective resource for advancing VLA research, reducing reliance on costly manual teleoperation.

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and
scalable resource for advancing VLA research.

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

Conclusion: 自适应ICP方法有效解决了初始位姿和动态环境问题，提升了配准精度。

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

Method: 通过实验室测试，比较Crawl N' Sense和Trot-Walk两种步态在测量松散沙土和表面结壳强度与纹理时的表现。

Result: 两种步态均能区分不同阻力地形，但小跑步态测量值方差更大；爬行步态能更精确检测表面结壳的脆性破裂。

Conclusion: 研究结果为腿式机器人在探测地形时的步态设计和科学测量提供了新见解。

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

Conclusion: ADP为高效机器人策略提供了一种简单插件，推动了机器人操作的效率和性能边界。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

Conclusion: 多阶段NMPC方法显著提升了外骨骼控制的鲁棒性，适用于复杂不确定性场景。

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization
to unseen objects. The project page is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLM）在微调为视觉语言动作（VLA）模型时因数据分布不匹配导致的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 使用自然语言表示低级动作，并仅用LoRA微调VLM，避免修改主干架构。

Result: VLM2VLA在VQA研究和800多次机器人实验中表现优异，支持零样本泛化。

Conclusion: VLM2VLA成功解决了灾难性遗忘问题，保持了VLM的核心能力，适用于开放世界语义推理和多语言指令跟随。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

Method: 提出H2R Aligner视频扩散模型实现视觉对齐，EgoStabilizer稳定视角，以及动作映射和逆运动学求解器实现动作对齐。

Result: 纯合成数据训练的VLA模型在真实机器人上实现少样本执行，平均成功率提升14.7%。

Conclusion: MimicDreamer有效缩小人类与机器人视频的领域差距，显著提升机器人任务性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

Result: 在长时程操作任务中，Super-Mimic比现有零样本方法性能提升20%以上。

Conclusion: 结合视频驱动的意图解析和前瞻性动力学建模是开发通用机器人系统的有效策略。

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

Result: 目前应用已能管理游戏、对话和情感响应，未来目标是实现多语言形态结构的教学。

Conclusion: 长期目标是创建基于LLM的机器人辅助语言学习干预，支持多种语言结构的教学。

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

Result: 在单板计算机上实验显示，优化时间降低56%，同时保持绝对位姿误差不变。

Conclusion: 新方法显著降低计算成本，适用于资源受限硬件，且不影响定位精度。

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

Conclusion: 系统性分析视觉偏见是开发安全可靠通用代理的前提。

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

TL;DR: UnderwaterVLA框架结合多模态基础模型与具身智能系统，提升水下导航的自主性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下操作中的流体扰动、通信带宽限制和浑浊水域感知退化问题。

Method: 采用双脑架构、Vision-Language-Action模型和流体动力学模型预测控制。

Result: 在实地测试中，导航误差减少，任务完成率提高19%至27%。

Conclusion: UnderwaterVLA为智能AUV提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these
requirements as probability distributions over capabilities and use this model
to allocate tasks such that robots with complementary skills naturally position
near uncertain tasks, proactively mitigating task failures without wasting
resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating
coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging
divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of
contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the
explanations excel beyond the baseline method.

Motivation: 在部分观察的新环境中执行语言指定的移动操作任务时，存在场景交互、语义信息基础和主动更新知识的挑战。

Conclusion: HELIOS通过分层表示和多视角一致性建模，有效解决了复杂场景中的移动操作任务。

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

TL;DR: 提出了一种意图驱动的车道变换框架，结合驾驶风格识别、合作感知决策和协调运动规划，显著提升了混合交通环境中的车道变换性能。


<details>

Motivation: 混合交通环境中，自动驾驶车辆与多样化的人类驾驶车辆交互时，不可预测的意图和异质行为使得安全高效的车道变换极具挑战性。现有方法常假设统一模式，过于简化这些交互。

Method: 框架包括：1) 基于NGSIM数据集的深度学习分类器实时识别人类驾驶风格；2) 合作评分系统量化周围驾驶员的合作意愿；3) 结合行为克隆和逆强化学习的决策模块；4) 模型预测控制与意图推断结合的轨迹生成。

Result: 实验显示，模型在车道变换识别中达到94.2%准确率和94.3% F1分数，优于基于规则和学习的方法4-15%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模驾驶员异质性，展示了在复杂交通环境中实现情境感知和类人自动驾驶的潜力。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to
advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Result: AUROC达0.95，优于现有方法（0.90-0.912），支持帧级预测。

Conclusion: 新方法在性能和效率上均有提升，公开数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen为自我中心视角鲁棒的机器人操作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

<details>

Motivation: 当前视频模型（如Sora）依赖被动观察，难以理解物理因果关系，需通过真实世界交互发展物理直觉。

Method: 训练14B参数的WoW模型，使用200万机器人交互轨迹，结合SOPHIA和逆向动力学模型优化输出。

Result: WoW在物理一致性、碰撞动力学和物体持久性方面表现优异，验证大规模交互对物理直觉的重要性。

Conclusion: 真实世界交互是AI发展物理直觉的关键，模型、数据和基准将开源。

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人操作的可扩展测试时计算提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured
pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level
controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,
end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with

Conclusion: SPF展示了出色的泛化能力，适用于不同视觉语言模型，为航空导航提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev
