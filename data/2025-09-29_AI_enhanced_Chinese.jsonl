It generates complex vortices\nthat induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous\nvibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution\nfeaturing (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes\nthe dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a\nsuction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to\nensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity\noperations.

The suction force model parameters are systematically\nidentified through extensive experimental measurements across varying\noperational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior\nperformance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0\ncm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over\ncascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%\nimprovements over standard MPC respectively.

Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo\nsimulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and\nrobustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "PL-VIWO2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027-\u8f6e\u5f0f\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u3001\u8f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3001SE(2)\u7ea6\u675f\u7684SE(3)\u8f6e\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff08MCC\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PL-VIWO2\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata\nfor DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and\nfidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that\nexisting approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with\nparameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence\nof task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a\ndata-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our\nkey observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation\nsubspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and\nfidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior\nresponses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby\nensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects\ncomplementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new\ntasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain\nconsistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This\njoint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge\nwhile retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a\nlayer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.\nTheoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that\njustify null-space filtering.

IGNs support both single-and\nmulti-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational\ncost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),\nconventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training\ninstabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular\napproaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one\ndistribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models\nhave gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity\ngeneration quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of\nhigh computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along\nthe entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and\nconsistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even\nperform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite\ndiffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,\ncalled SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require\nadversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed\nscore-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively\ndistilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than\niterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing\nusers to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the\nsource domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto\nthe target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs.

To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we\nfirst build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark\nderived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.\nBuilding on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction\nparadigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of\nmissing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its\nability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of\nobservations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical\nstate. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that\nefficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with\ngeometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of\ncomputational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the\nchallenges posed by varying input combinations.

This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative\n& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving\nnon-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase\ncontrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy.

These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object\ninteractions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning\nand low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential\ncapabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective\ngoal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including\ntraditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or\nsparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods\nstruggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a\nnovel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon\nManipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural\nrepresentation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging\ntask-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control.

Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL\nmodels: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand\nsubstantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive\ndatasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing\nrandom sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of\nthe original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias\ntowards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset.

We\npropose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key\nstages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy\nlearning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature\nlearning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$\nacross layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we\nprovably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on\nmissing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles\nplayed by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample\nsizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and\ngeneralization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as\nMuon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics.

However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the\ndesign of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because\nof uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to\nhandle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used\nlinearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these\ncan degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To\naddress this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive\nControl (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a\ntwo-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.\nThis method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The\nstudy focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing\nphase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and\nexperimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves\nrobustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors\nand interaction forces under various uncertainties.

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at\nthis task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately\nserve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using\nLLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for\nchildren with language vulnerabilities.

We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate\ninertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement\ntimestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR\nmeasurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of\nnodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single\nboard computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB\nRAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional\nbaseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization\ntime by up to 56 %.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eIMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u96f7\u8fbe\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u96f7\u8fbe-LiDAR\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0eLiDAR\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u7387\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9891\u7387IMU\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u6700\u65b0LiDAR\u72b6\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u521b\u5efa\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e56%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Our key technical\ncontributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact\ninteractions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a\ncoordination strategy that enables collaborative control.

One major limitation of most existing definitions is\nthat they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in\nwhich multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping\nto the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract\ninvariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions\ncalled projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to\naccommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected\nabstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent\nobservational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to\nhigh-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove\na new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal\nqueries from limited low-level data.

Despite its empirical success,\nits role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this\nwork, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly\ncharacterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm (\"ridge-less\")\nlinear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further\nanalysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based\npretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated\nacross diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)\napplied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an\nembarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random\nMask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features\nfrom data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our\nlinear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA\nsequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard\nand more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for\nstate-of-the-art models.

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new\nregularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep\nNeural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships\nin complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,\nour method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear\nbaseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while\npreserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a\ncomprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,\nmeasures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements\ninto the training objective.

Recently, physiological foundation models based\non Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict\ncritical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful\nrepresentation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the\ndownstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to\nimprove PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we\npropose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the\nevent onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.\nSecond, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them\npatient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the\nlargest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the\np-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as\nperson identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we\npropose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary\nestimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as\nlactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via\nzero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform\nlabels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets.

Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic\nunderstanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods\ntypically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive\nmaps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from\nspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which\nimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in\nhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the\nright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework\nfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and\nvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural\nrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior\nknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the\nhistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic\nencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs\nof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,\nenabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nJanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For\nexample, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using\nmultiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB\ntraining data.

Inspired by\nthis, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision\nby organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts\nserve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires\ntask-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and\nlimits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation\nmodels inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more\nunified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model\nadapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a\nframework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various\nvision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as\nvisual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the\nexpected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two\nperspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images\nand videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks\nfrom natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite\nbeing trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both\nsettings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by\nsimply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm.

While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand\ngeometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and\nstruggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image\nsuper-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.\nThese methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed\nresolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this\npaper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing\ndetailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution\nimages. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with\nexplicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit\nimage function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse\ninput images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D\nhand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among\nupsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,\nnails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to\nhand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and\nqualitatively.

In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework\nintegrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.\nSpecifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a\nlip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual\nsynchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible\nlip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the\nocclusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects\nto the inpainting process.

However, a fundamental\nchallenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily\nstemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To\naddress this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,\nwhich innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency\ncharacterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs\n(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively\ncontrolling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile\naccuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses\n(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary\nsampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.\nTo enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an\ninput-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism\nthat focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight\nnormalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.\nTheoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees\nconsistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping\nPRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter\nprobability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex\ndesign in Lyapunov functions.

However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual\nconditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by\ntext prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon\nor imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a\nspecific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.\nIn contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common\nsettings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can\nserve as rough visual guides.

Despite recent\nprogress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps\ncompared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to\nhistorical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),\nwe revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a\nfundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss\nlinear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,\nwe propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play\nframework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather\nthan directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model\nparameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to\nprevious task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,\nIVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The\ntransformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information\nMatrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based\nscenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full\ndemonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL\nbaselines.

To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,\nrecent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically\ntransfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting\nmulti-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture\nintrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled\ndecomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first\npromptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.\nFollowing the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder\narchitecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially\nstructured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable\nlarge-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation\npipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,\nproviding diverse and fine-grained labels.

In this work, we address this gap\nthrough a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the\noutput depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random\nlocation. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of\nattention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization\nperformance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population\nlevel, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention\nfundamentally falls short.

Rather than relying on manual\nprompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning\n(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as\na reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant\nchallenge that requires explicit diversity objectives.

In this work, we present a systematic study\nof the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key\nvisual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a\ncarefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often\nproduce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental\nlimitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that\nthis phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably\nperceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the\nunbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In\nparticular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,\nintroduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at\ndifferent positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding.

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning.

Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,\nour method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external\ntools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple\nSudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy\ninvolving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,\nwe seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution.

We also demonstrate capability for aligning images\ngenerated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains\n(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these\naligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable\nmanner.

Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a\nfundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient\nbackpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing\nthe hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of\ncodebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the\ncodebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers\nshould remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)\nall codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse.

String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but\nignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic\nequivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded\nsimilarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we\nintroduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement\nSimilarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural\ninformation to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first\ntransforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic\nstructure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED\n(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances\ntraditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through\ntransformations.

While existing pruning methods\nprimarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to\nsubstantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel\npruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic\nexperts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure\nthe importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information\nbased on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address\nthe computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,\nHEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the\nsecond-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert\nparameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic\nexpert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where\nd is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward\npasses and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the\nimportance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including\nDeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing\nexpert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and\nbenchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at\ncompression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs\nnearly by 20%.

However, they neglect the high\nspatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame\nsequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token\nsparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token\nrepresentations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them\nineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose\nProgressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for\nevent data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the\nspatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to\neffectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an\noptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists\nof two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial\nToken Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the\nspatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent\ninterference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token\nSelection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event\nframes, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information.

Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training.

Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable\ndata annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to\nmodels that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality\nand ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the\nlimitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.\nA primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the\ninherently subjective nature of what constitutes a \"good\" caption. We introduce\nCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that\nredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should\nenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the\ncorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM\ngenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a\nseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on\nthat caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image\ncaptioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple\nsettings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B\nresults in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks.

Meanwhile,\nlarge-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,\nmaking them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we\nintroduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from\ndiffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural\nmodifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these\nfeatures, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning\nboth images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention\nmagnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.\nMoreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers\nand show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary\ntokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps.

As\ntraining progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing\nsuccessful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level\nexploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.\nTo further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in\nthe replay buffer to address the potential policy drift.

By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof\nthat the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to\nthe true data distribution as the training set size increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08DFM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d7\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DFM\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "DFM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d7\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff08Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684DFM\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aDFM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Recent deep learning\napproaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on\ngeneralization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these\nlimitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization\nproblem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that\nenforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method\nyields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than\ncompressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the\nsample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and\nthe structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the\nbound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.\nReplacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds\nthat depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph\nsize. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization\nguarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\uff08CEA\uff09\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9b54\u65b9\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5916\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CEA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528PDB\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9b54\u65b9\u9886\u57df\uff0cCEA\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08PDB\uff09\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u66f4\u5177\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ReLU\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}
